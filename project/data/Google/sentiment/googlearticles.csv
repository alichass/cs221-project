2017-11-17T09:47:15-05:00,"The equity markets have just had a mini tantrum. We saw six days of red opens and it felt like the markets were in full turmoil. Yet the scoreboard showed barely a scratch. The PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: ) was only 1.7% off its all-time highs on Wednesday. And after Thursday’s rebound, it set a new high.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ), like the whole FANG herd, fell 3.2% high to low during this brief malaise. It only lasted mere days, but was the longest in a while. Here it is now sitting less than 1% from its closing high.

Although I don’t like to chase all-time highs, today I want to add to my bullish exposure to GOOGL stock. I have been doing this successfully for months, and it’s the only way I can justify risking money this late in the game.

Conversely, I am not one to call for a crash — although one can occur at any time. I will continue to go long Alphabet stock but leave plenty of room for error.

The important premise to my style of trading is that I believe in the long-term viability of the company and that I am okay owning the shares should the worst case scenario happen to my trades.

Fundamentally, GOOGL stock is now even cheaper than I thought it was the last time I traded it. It reported a great quarter and the metrics are now even more favorable to value. It has a price-to-earnings ratio of 35 which is inline with like-minded companies say Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: ). From that perspective it’s definitely more expensive that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) but in all fairness GOOGL has always commanded a premium to AAPL on Wall Street. Perhaps traders like having its forays into more exciting venues on the horizon.

Technically, even though GOOGL stock is near its all-time high, it looks like it has plenty of room to rise and stay inside its ascending standard regression channel. Meaning that I fail to see an obvious downside pressure or strain from the daily chart."
2017-11-14T12:26:53-05:00,"At the end of the day, seasoned investors know that investing in markets has a large element of gambling to it. Despite all the research, whether top down or bottom up, markets have that element of chance that looms large. But as far as bets go, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) feels as close to a sure thing as one can get.

The third quarter demonstrated that GOOGL isn’t having trouble sustaining high double-digit growth rates. Revenues were up 24% year-over-year and operating margins improved by 200 basis points as well.

Other Bets revenues, in particular, was very positive. The segment delivered 53% year-over-year growth and, while the total amount for the quarter was a tiny $302 million in comparison to advertising revenues of over $24 billion, it is on the rise. Investments that fall under the umbrella of Other Bets may take longer to monetize, but I have long held that the potential for coming up with another disruptive business lies in this segment.

Businesses that are included in Other Bets include Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Nest, and Waymo — though the majority of revenues come from Google Fiber, Nest products and services, and licensing/R&D services through Verily.

Specifically, Waymo seems to be on the precipice of becoming a leader in the autonomous vehicle industry, which may surprise some given that GOOGL is not an automotive company. However, because of GOOGL’s technological edge, they have been able implement the software and hardware changes necessary to make this a reality, while traditional auto makers are more focused on energy efficiency.

GOOGL has been working on this technological breakthrough since 2009, and indications are that they have the lead with early riders already on the road."
2017-11-13T06:44:16-05:00,"Late last month, yours truly here read some things between the lines regarding the sizeable investment Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ) made in ride-sharing service Lyft. Chief among those possibilities was the notion that Alphabet’s (well, Google’s technically) self-driving automobile project called Waymo was within sight of commercialization.

It wasn’t an idea all owners of GOOGL stock agreed with. Indeed, I even conceded “Meaningful commercialization of Waymo, whether it be through Lyft or through Uber or through both is still miles away.” As it turns out, however, even my optimism didn’t give Waymo enough credit.

If you didn’t think Waymo was for real (or real enough to pose a threat to the ride-hailing industry) this might change your mind.

While Alphabet’s decision to invest $1 billion in Lyft was made all the more interesting in light of the fact that Alphabet was also an early supporter of rival Uber, the potential business partnership is highlighted by this week’s report that Waymo-driven minivans are now cruising the streets of Phoenix without a driver behind the wheel just in case things go wrong. It’s a testament to the confidence the company has in its driving system.

Alphabet’s Waymo isn’t the world’s first fully-autonomous driving system, to be fair. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) offers what it calls “Enhanced Autopilot,” which can take the wheel as long as there’s a driver in the driver’s seat that makes such a request. Though CEO Elon Musk isn’t entirely sure the computer doing the driving is powerful enough to meet government safety standards, clearly the know-how is within reach.

Then there’s General Motors Company (NYSE: ), which put an self-driven (though still manned) vehicle on the streets of Manhattan last month after previously putting its autonomous car technology through its paces on less-busy roads.

There’s a noticeable difference between what GM, Tesla, Waymo and a handful of other outfits are doing in the self-driving car arena though, a difference future and current GOOGL stockholders may want to take note of. That is, where as Tesla’s Enhanced Autopilot and GM’s “Cruise” platforms are designed for consumer-oriented cars, Waymo increasingly looks like it was built from the ground up to serve as the brains of a self-driving fleet of taxis that will put Alphabet in the transportation business."

2017-10-30T11:19:00-04:00,"Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star then zero on your touch-tone telephone. And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor.

Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth, and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them.

During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today.

And I will hand the call over to Ruth.

Thanks, Ellen. We had a terrific quarter. Revenues of $27.8 billion were up 24% year-on-year and also up 24% in constant currency. Advertising revenues benefited from strong performance in sites, which was powered by tremendous results in mobile search.

Healthy growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. We also benefited from substantial growth in other revenues from Cloud, Play, and hardware.

Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. Next, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.

Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $27.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. We realized a positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $255 million or $64 million after the impact of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year-over-year. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. Performance was strong in all regions.

U.S. revenues were $12.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $9.1 billion, up 23% year-over-year in both reported and fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $4.2 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 31% in fixed FX terms.

Other Americas revenues were $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 32% in fixed FX terms. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $11.1 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.6 billion, up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically: costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and hardware-related costs. Operating expenses were $8.8 billion, up 11% year-over-year.

The year-on-year expense growth in part reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year. As discussed previously, this change in SBC grant timing affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017 with elevated year-on-year expense growth in the first half of the year but benefits the year-on-year comparisons for Q3 and Q4. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 78,101, up 2,495 people from last quarter.

As in prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in Cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we placed on this business. Operating income was $7.8 billion, up 35% versus last year, and the operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was $197 million.

We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 15.6% for the third quarter. Net income was $6.7 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $9.57. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow.

Cash CapEx for the quarter was $3.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.9 billion with free cash flow of $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $100.1 billion, of which approximately $60.5 billion or 60% is held overseas. Let me now turn to our segment financial results.

Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $27.5 billion, up 23% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. Network revenues were $4.3 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob.

Other revenues for Google were $3.4 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Play, and hardware. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.5 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 32% year-over-year.

The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year.

Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $8.7 billion, up 29% versus last year, and the operating margin was 32%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction. Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the third quarter, Other Bets revenues were $302 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily.

Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $812 million for the third quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $77 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q '16. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates.

Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches, including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat. Nest also announced a home security solution that includes the Nest Secure alarm system, Nest Hello video doorbell, the Nest Cam IQ outdoor security camera and corresponding software and services. Operating expenses were $8.8 billion, up 11% year-over-year. The year-on-year expense growth in part reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year.

Other Bets accrued CapEx was $77 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q '16. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches, including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat.

Nest also announced a home security solution that includes the Nest Secure alarm system, Nest Hello video doorbell, the Nest Cam IQ outdoor security camera and corresponding software and services. Waymo continues to expand its geographic presence and announced this morning that it will commence winter testing in Michigan to build on our progress to date addressing the challenge of autonomous driving in cold weather, particularly with snow, sleet, and ice. Michigan is the sixth state where Waymo is testing its self-driving vehicles. Over the last 8 years, Waymo's cars have self-driven in more than 20 cities.

With Loon, we were pleased to announce just last week that the team is collaborating with AT&T to deliver emergency Internet service to the hardest-hit parts of Puerto Rico. Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, in terms of revenues, results this quarter again reflect our relentless focus on innovation, which is growing our advertising revenues. I frequently highlight our culture of innovation.

In that regard, the most important point is that we are data-driven with an extraordinary team of engineers, product managers and designers who constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences. This approach enables us to find new opportunities given that the way consumers seek information continues to evolve. Our teams work relentlessly to anticipate and adapt to the expanding capabilities of both software and hardware. Further, our culture of innovation is building our nonadvertising revenue streams in Cloud, Play, and hardware.

Earlier this month, for example, we launched our expanded line of hardware products, bringing the best AI software and hardware together and building on the first-generation of Made by Google products we introduced last year. Longer term, we remain excited about the opportunities in our Other Bets with ongoing progress. Second, with respect to profitability. We continue to remain focused on long-term dollar growth versus margins.

The pressure in our total cost of revenues reflects our product mix shift with a number of our higher-growth businesses also carrying higher cost of revenues. In our advertising businesses, TAC continues to increase as our highest growth areas, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. We expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue. As we frequently stated, we remain focused on profit dollar growth, and these areas are additive to our growth.

The other cost of revenues associated with our nonadvertising businesses is also affected by product mix. In the fourth quarter, in particular, the impact of our growing hardware line will be more accentuated given the early stage of this business and the holiday seasonality. On operating expenses, we remain committed to investing to support our growing product areas. The more modest OpEx growth in Q3 reflects both the timing of stock-based compensation and the timing of sales and marketing spend with the reality that not all investments fall neatly into a single calendar quarter.

In particular, we're committed to sales and marketing investments in Q4 for the important holiday season. The most significant uptick in marketing will be to support our new expanded hardware line, which was just announced at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In addition, we are investing to support YouTube and our other platforms. Third, as to CapEx, we continue to invest to support business momentum, including increased compute power from machine learning, which is an asset across Alphabet, as well as to support cloud, search and YouTube growth.

In conclusion, a great quarter. Thank you, and let me now turn the call over to Sundar.

Thank you, Ruth. We had another great quarter. I've been really proud of the progress this quarter, launching popular new products and continuing to grow our business in new areas. It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for 1 billion people a day.

Even though we are in the early days of AI, we are already rethinking how to build products around machine learning. It's a new paradigm compared to mobile-first software, and I'm thrilled how Google is leading the way. Consumers can already experience how AI allows them to interact with computing more naturally than ever before. Computers are adapting to people rather than people needing to adapt to computers.

Fundamental to this experience is Google Search and Assistant. We introduced Assistant last year, and it continues to get better every day, helping people get things done in the real world. Walmart and Target have recently integrated with Google Home, which means you can order everyday items from them much more easily. 500 million people now use the machine learning smarts of Google Photos to manage and share their memories.

The 1 billion-plus people using Google Maps now get thoughtfully contextual information like how to find parking where they are going. And businesses are seeing how AI can help them grow. Our open-source software, TensorFlow, is allowing anyone to use machine learning to solve problems even in industries like agriculture. Researchers recently used TensorFlow to make smartphones able to identify disease in cassava plants, a major food source in the developing world.

We made TensorFlow open-source and free because we fundamentally believe in creating computing platforms that developers can customize and build on. I'm really pleased with the way our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome, have continued to grow, enabling great experiences for people all over the world and powering devices for more than 1,000 brands worldwide. This quarter, we released the latest operating system, Android 8.0, and released the preview of ARCore, which brings augmented reality to existing Android phones. Last week, we announced a partnership with Samsung to bring ARCore to all Galaxy devices.

Even though it's been an incredibly busy few years and technology is moving rapidly, at our core, we remain an information company. Our mission, to provide useful information to people in every corner of the world, is unchanged. We care deeply about the quality of information we provide and constantly work to get this right. As technology evolves, we have to evolve with it to ensure quality information can flourish.

Our teams are making a big effort to support journalists and other people who produce high-quality information around the world. We are supporting publishers as they decide the right approach to free articles and subscription content. We are moving away from First Click Free to a more flexible model of content sampling, and we are working with publishers to build a frictionless payment solution for subscriptions that can help them grow revenues and find new readers. As new threats arise, we are committed to protecting journalists and media organizations from hacking and denial-of-service attacks.

For example, we just launched the Advanced Protection Program for Google Accounts, which is designed to protect the accounts of those most at risk of targeted attacks, including journalists and other public figures. To wrap up my overview, I'm thrilled with how Google is solving big problems and making products that billions of people use every day. Now let's review our 3 big bets, starting with YouTube. YouTube continues to see phenomenal growth as the premier global destination where people go to watch video.

Three of the key areas we are focused on are: strengthening the existing community; continuing to drive growth; and expanding our subscriptions business. On the community side, we are helping create meaningful interactions that bring creators and fans closer together. This quarter, we launched a new feature that lets viewers share videos directly in the app. So the minute you see a video from a creator you love, you can share the fun with friends and family.

We're also seeing significant growth in other areas. As I mentioned in the last earnings call, YouTube now has over 1.5 billion users. On average, these users spend 60 minutes a day on mobile. But this growth isn't just happening on desktop and mobile.

YouTube now gets over 100 million hours of watch time in the living room every day, and that's up 70% in the past year alone. We are continuing to invest in new subscription-based monetization models. YouTube Red, our first foray into the subscription market, is on track to release over 40 original shows this year, and YouTube TV, our live TV subscription service, continues to expand into new markets. It now covers 2/3 of U.S.

households and is available in 50 metro areas. We are continuing to invest in new subscription-based monetization models.

It now covers 2/3 of U.S.

households and is available in 50 metro areas. Now on to Google Cloud. We continue to make progress winning over enterprise customers. Customers tell us they are switching to Google Cloud Platform because of our prowess in data analytics and machine learning.

Our commitment to being an open platform with tools like Kubernetes, which runs in both cloud and hybrid environments and our leadership in security. Just yesterday, we announced a new partnership with Cisco. We are collaborating on an open solution that gives customers an easy approach to their cloud, enabling them to run apps that span both on-prem environments and Google Cloud Platform. G Suite, our collaboration, and productivity applications are leading the industry.

We have made improvements to Drive, Docs and Gmail, launching new features to help teams work better together. Nielsen recently moved to G Suite and said it's a great productivity and collaboration tool for their modern workflows. All of these things are driving momentum with customers and partners. Companies like Kohl's, PayPal, Rolls-Royce Marine in Europe and popular messaging app, Hike in India, moved to Google Cloud.

We also announced a new partnership with Marketo and expanded our relationships with Pivotal and VMware. To support our growing global customer base, we introduced 2 new regions in the quarter in São Paulo and Frankfurt and continue to grow our go-to-market team. Next, our hardware business. Earlier this month, we launched our second-generation family of Made by Google hardware products built with AI at the core.

Last year, we focused on building the foundation to launch a line of devices made by Google. This year, we are focused on bringing together the best AI software and hardware to give people a great user experience. For example, the new Google Home Max is a smart speaker powered by the Assistant. It has AI-based smart sound, which adapts the audio experience to the user's environment, context, and preferences.

The new Pixel 2 has the world's best smartphone camera and a useful feature where you can summon the Google Assistant by just squeezing the phone. To get these devices in people's hands, we are also focused on scaling our go-to-market strategy. We are investing more in marketing. We are launching in more countries, and we are offering these devices in more retailers, and we are already seeing results.

Preorders of Pixel on Day 1 this year were more than double what they were last year. Also, this quarter, we signed a deal with HTC in Taiwan that will help accelerate our hardware business by bringing on a team of talented engineers. This deal lays the foundation for our continued efforts next year. And our advertising platforms continue to drive greater sales for our partners.

While mobile has given rise to an unprecedented amount of data and complexity for advertisers, we think that machine learning will help it make -- will help make it easier for advertisers to reach consumers. But even as we give advertisers incredible scale and reach across our ad platforms, we know consumer retention is scarce. That's why we are pleased YouTube ads continue to deliver the highest viewability rate in the industry. YouTube now has a 95% ad viewability rate, which is significantly higher than the average 66% viewability rate of other video ads.

We continue to see the industry shift to 6-second bumper ads and saw great adoption this quarter from brands like Bear, Ben & Jerry's, Louis Vuitton and Woolworths. And Google continues to be the platform of choice to help small business owners get online and grow their business. On our last earnings call, I mentioned the free website builder for small businesses. During the quarter, more than 1 million small businesses used it to build websites, helping many of them get online for the first time.

We also introduced local posts, which allows small business owners to easily post their latest updates like upcoming events, special offers, and new arrivals right on Google Search and Maps. Our commitment to both large and small advertisers shows how we build products that all businesses can succeed at. That mission also has a geographical dimension, and I wanted to say a word about the momentum we are seeing in Asia. Our revenues are up significantly in the region, driven by great results we are driving for existing and new advertisers.

That holds true across developed markets like Japan and emerging markets like the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which have seen the number of active advertisers grow by 25% or more in the past 12 months. And this growth is bringing tremendous benefits to our partners there. In the past 3 years, we have paid out more than $24 billion to our publisher, creator and app developer partners in Asia-Pacific. And to help millions of people, we are building products specifically designed for local markets in Asia.

In India last month, we launched Tez, a mobile payments and commerce app that already has more than 7.5 million users who have made more than 30 million transactions. I'm really excited about the potential this brings for India's mostly cash-based economy. As I said at the start, it's been a great quarter for Google. Just 2 weeks ago, I was in Pittsburgh launching our new Grow with Google initiative, which provides digital skills to millions of people and economic opportunity to countless businesses.

It was amazing to see firsthand the transformative impact that information is having in schools, in the workplace, and for local business. As I said then, I remain a technology optimist not only because I believe in technology, but because I believe in people. I want to thank all the Googlers who continue to work so hard to advance their mission and to help people everywhere. Thank you.

Thank you, Sundar.  And we will now take your questions.

Ladies and gentlemen on the phone lines. If you want to ask a question at this time, please press one and the number key on your touch-tone telephone. If your question has been answered, you may wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.

Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One, we see a lot of partnership announcements intra-quarter on the e-commerce side with Google Express and voice-assisted shopping on Google Home. Wanted to understand better your ambitions in e-commerce as a marketplace or a platform and how that might also feedback into the advertising business.

Second question will be about the cash on the balance sheet and sort of how philosophically you think about deploying that cash against either shareholder returns or some of the big opportunities you laid out today.

Maybe I'll take the 1st question given to are up on the cash question. You know, we are very excited about the partnerships we are getting here, you know with... with large retailers and... and you know we are seeing traction globally. You know, we've obviously partnered with them to our, you know, advertising products, but... but shopping especially Eskimo want to make shopping more seamless across mobile, a newer computing categories like Google home. I think there's tremendous interest here.

So we, you know, we are just getting started and you know, I think you would see C. S. make a lot more progress and have a lot more announcements and I think we're going to be relentlessly focused on making the buying experience much more seamless for uses. So you know it, you know, so this a lot more to come.

So in terms of your second question, there was really no change from the approach we've talked about previously as we think about capital allocation. The priority is organic. As you said in your question, we have a host of really exciting opportunities, and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains number one. The second is strategic, continuing to add on where it makes sense.

We're pleased to have added on HTC this quarter. Acquisitions have obviously been an important part of our history. And then the third is the return of capital, and no change or update there in terms of how I think about that.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.

Great. Thanks. Two questions, please. Sundar, you talked about the APAC.

You called out Asia, and I -- we noticed that, too, that year-over-year growth rate was higher than -- was the highest at least since you've been disclosing it. And you provided some of the whats, but any whys behind why that growth is accelerating? Is that something that has just naturally reached the tipping point? Is there something different that Alphabet, Google has done in Asia to accelerate that growth? And then, Ruth, can I ask you? You talked about the factors driving TAC, and you mentioned changes in partner agreements. Is there any way you could give us any more color? Did you just renew some major partner agreements and there's nothing of that magnitude into next year? Or should we just assume that this is just part of operations? There was nothing major reason, you can have major ones coming up? Just something that -- help us qualify. I don't think you had used that language before what that indicated.

You know, the Asia question. Largely, I think we've been laying a foundation for a very, very long time. Our products are very heavily used there. And so we worked hard to build a user base, and then the mobile translation is -- mobile transformation is a secular shift there.

That's definitely driving accelerated growth, new -- and it creates a virtuous cycle. We see new advertisers coming on. We are investing more in Asia as well in addition to our go-to-market themes. We are building out great product and engineering teams.

That what has led us to improve core products like Search, Maps, YouTube, et cetera, to work better in those regions. And we also launched region-specific products like Google Tez in India. So I think overall, that's creating a good virtuous cycle, and I'm looking forward to having more momentum there.

And on your TAC question. As I indicated in the opening comments, there are a couple of drivers here. One is changes in partner agreements. And I think the main point is we're very pleased with our strong partnerships across the mobile ecosystem.

And the other was the ongoing shift to mobile, which we've talked about a lot, and the fact that it carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. I think the most important point is what you're seeing is we have a very healthy mobile business, search business, and it is growing substantially. And our focus remains on long-term revenue and profit dollar growth.

Okay, thank you.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.

Thanks for taking the question. I had two. First, Ruth, you talked about the ongoing advertising innovation, and it's pretty clear that that's happening in mobile, which seems like it probably accelerated in the quarter. So I was hoping you could comment on that.

But then also, how do you think about where you are in terms of optimization on mobile relative to desktop? And then just second, on YouTube. I was hoping you could comment on the extent which you're seeing marketers ret"
2017-10-31T14:02:00-04:00,"Financially, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) crushed it in its third quarter. Ahead of Q3, the tech giant's revenue growth already looked impressive. Yet the Google parent company's top-line growth still accelerated in Q3, rising 24% year over year, beating analysts' estimates by about $600 million. Alphabet's bottom line similarly beat estimates.

But there was more to Alphabet's third quarter than analyst-beating revenue and EPS. In Alphabet's third-quarter earnings call, management talked acquisitions, growth drivers, and its strategy for hardware -- all important narratives for investors to keep an eye on.

With Alphabet purchasing part of HTC's business recently in order to beef up its hardware business, one analyst wanted to get an update on how management thinks of capital allocation and acquisitions. While management's approach to considering and acquiring companies hasn't changed, it's useful to review Alphabet's line of thinking on the important subject.

The priority is organic [growth]. As you said in your question, we have a host of really exciting opportunities, and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains number one. The second is strategic, continuing to add on where it makes sense. We're pleased to have added on HTC this quarter. Acquisitions have obviously been an important part of our history. And then the third is the return of capital, and no change or update there in terms of how I think about that.

With Alphabet posting one of its highest year-over-year revenue growth rates in five years, one analyst wanted more color on whether there were factors during the quarter that were an anomaly, or whether the drivers were sustainable aspects of Alphabet's business. While Porat didn't answer the question directly, her response suggests Alphabet is benefiting from some major growth drivers that are likely to stick around.

We feel -- we're really pleased with the [Google] sites revenue growth, the performance in mobile desktop and YouTube. I think if you just go down to the big categories, network [members' properties] revenue also was quite strong. ... And then Sundar has talked a lot about the components of other revenues up nicely. We're really pleased with what's going on there. And then on top of that, Other Bets have got a couple of components to it. I tried to give you color on each one.

In other words, Alphabet's business is benefiting from strong broad-based growth, not just across its major revenue segments, but from smaller categories like Google ""other"" revenue (cloud, Google Play app store, and hardware), and ""Other Bets"" revenue (Alphabet's smaller ""moonshot"" businesses).

Considering Alphabet's recent acquisition of part of HTC's business and its recent launch of eight new Google-branded hardware products, management has clearly prioritized hardware more than it has in the past. This prompted one analyst to ask management to clarify its goals on hardware, as well as comment on how this will impact its relationships with Android partners.

In terms of hardware, we are very seriously committed to making hardware. A few reasons. Hardware is -- the intersection of hardware and software is how you drive computing forward. And historically, hardware has been maybe a single- device business. For a long while, it was PCs and then maybe smartphones. But you're clearly entering an era where you're going to have different types of computing experiences. And so to do that and to stitch it all together across, I think it's important we thoughtfully put our opinion forward. We're equally committed to working with the ecosystem, and we provide the same basis on both sites, be it Android or Chrome.

So, though Alphabet its ramping up its hardware efforts, don't expect it to soften its efforts partnering with hardware manufacturers like Samsung. It seems like the company wants to have a strong presence in hardware without overpowering its existing relationships with original equipment manufacturers.

Overall, Alphabet's third-quarter earnings call reinforced the factors behind the company's strong competitive position. Strong, broad-based growth looks poised to continue."

2017-11-08T20:48:57Z,"A comprehensive valuation of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) based on the Q3 results indicates that the company's shares continue to grow with some reservations.

First of all, let's estimate the current value of Alphabet performing a direct comparison of the company's key multiples and those of its direct competitors:

As we can see, the three multiples selected for the comparison indicate the presence of the growth potential. Thus, judging by the EV/EBITDA, which I trust the most, the current stock price of Alphabet is only approaching the minimum boundary of the projected range.

But this kind of analysis is always a draft one because we compare the multiples of the companies in different stages of their life cycles. So the next step will be to evaluate how the internal growth of Alphabet's financial indicators corresponds to the current value of the company.

Revenue (ttm) of Alphabet in Q3 2017 increased by 22.27% YOY, and this is the best result for the previous three years. At the same time, the current value of the EV/Sales is not significantly higher than the average level of the previous two quarters and falls within the confidence interval of the regression line, reflecting the historical relationship between Alphabet's revenue growth and the values of the EV/Sales multiple. It is worth noting that this dependence is of high quality, which indicates the primary importance of the revenue growth in the eyes of Alphabet's investors.

In my opinion, in terms of revenue growth, Alphabet is now fairly assessed by the market.

The EBITDA of Alphabet grew by 14.89% YOY in Q3, which is better than the Q2 result (13.53% YOY), but significantly worse than the Q1 result (26.23% YOY). At that, the current value of the EV/EBITDA is close to the maximum values for the last 5 years:

As you can see, over the last two quarters, the EBITDA growth rate was substantially exceeding the balanced level; i.e., the level that corresponds the current interdependence between the EBITDA growth rate and the value of the EV/EBITDA. From this point of view, Alphabet became closer to the overpriced state.

The same conclusion follows from the growth analysis of the Operating Cash Flow. Alphabet's this indicator grew up by only 9.06% YOY in Q3, which is the third worst result in the company's entire public history. At that, the current value of the EV/OpFCF is one of the largest in the past five years, which indicates the overvalued state of the company.



But we have to admit that the relationship between the growth of the OpFCF and the values of the EV / OpFCF is much worse than in the two previous cases, which probably indicates that the OpFCF is not the key indicator in the eyes of the average Alphabet's investor.

And, in order to give you the third point of view, I included the actualized DCF-model of Alphabet's value, primarily published on June 27.

As I have already noted, Alphabet's revenue in Q3 exceeded the market forecasts and prompted a more optimistic look at the future sales of the company.

According to Yahoo! Finance, here's what the average analysts' expectations regarding Alphabet's revenues in 2017 and 2018 were like in June:

And here's what they look like now:



I've modified my revenue forecast model of Alphabet for the next 10 years, taking into account changes in expectations, and got the following prediction:

Other parameters of the model were adjusted on the basis of the latest Alphabet's reports, as well as the changes in the U.S. debt market:

Here is the WACC calculation:

And here's the model itself:

So, for now, the DCF-based target price of Alphabet's shares is $1,347, offering 28% upside.

As a logical experiment, I've created a similar model, provided that Trump's efforts will succeed and the corporate tax rate will be reduced to 20%:

In that case the DCF-based target price of Alphabet's shares is $1,480, offering 41% upside.

The WACC calculation is made on the basis of the current annual Beta coefficient equaling 0.91, which is close to the historic maximum. High Beta reduces the projected stock price within the framework of the DCF-modeling and is generally in the negative correlation with the return on Alphabet's equity.

However, Beta is not constant and prone to cyclical changes. Looking at the dynamics of the 180-day rolling Beta of Alphabet, we notice that during the last month it was at the maximum level close to the year 2005, never rising above this level:

If the rollback of Beta to the lower values follows in the near future, this will be another reason in favor of buying Alphabet's shares.

In my opinion, the Q3 results did not significantly change the position of Alphabet, and the company still has a growth potential. There are disturbing trends associated with slower growth of EBITDA and OpFCF, but apparently, Alphabet's investors do not care about these indicators too much now. Now it is also important to follow Beta because if the dynamics of this coefficient passes a turning point and begins to decline, the risk of investing in Alphabet will significantly decrease.

2017-11-01T22:32:31Z,"The recent quarterly results by tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) helped drive the Nasdaq to the best gains of the year. Post their result announcements, the Nasdaq climbed 2% in the day - its biggest climb this year - as the stocks themselves climbed to their record highs.

Alphabet's third-quarter revenues grew 23% over the year to $27.7 billion, ahead of the Street's forecast of $27.2 billion. EPS of $9.57 also was significantly ahead of the market's forecast of $8.31 for the quarter.

By segment, revenues from the Google segment grew 23% to $22.3 billion. Revenues from Google properties grew 23% to $19.72 billion, and revenues from members' websites grew 16% to $4.3 billion. Other revenues for Google, which includes revenues from non-ad businesses, including the Play Store, cloud app and infrastructure sales and hardware, grew 40% over the year to $3.4 billion. Revenues from Other Bets grew 53% to $302 million.

Among operating metrics, aggregate paid clicks grew 47% over the year and 6% sequentially. Paid clicks on Google websites grew 55% over the year, and paid clicks on member's websites grew 10% over the year. Aggregate cost per click fell 18% over the year, driven by an 18% decline on Google properties and a 5% decline on Network Members' properties. On a sequential basis, aggregate cost per click improved 1% over the year, driven by improvement in Google properties.

Alphabet continued to add additional capabilities to YouTube during the quarter. To drive more users to the service, it is now simplifying how YouTube TV subscribers stream live television on their TVs. The service will be available through an app for over-the-top streaming TV devices. The new app is available for Android TV streaming devices and for Microsoft's Xbox device. Alphabet plans to roll out the app for other streaming TV devices, including Roku, Apple TV (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), LG (OTC:LGEAF) and Sony (NYSE:SNE), before the end of the year.

YouTube TV, which was launched in April this year, is now available in the top 50 markets in the US, reaching 68% of American households. Since more than 50% of the time spent on YouTube is spent casting live programming onto a television, the new app is particularly geared toward this user base. Besides streaming, the new app will allow users to control it with the remote control or the game controller. Since most live streaming happens for sports events, the app will allow users to view team rosters and standings from major leagues. Other features include the ability to continue from where the user left the earlier streaming session irrespective of the device they were streaming from, and allowing users to search through different streaming titles while the live programming continues to play in the background.

Alphabet still does not disclose detailed performance for YouTube. But it has surely been one of the big revenue drivers for the company. For the recent quarter, YouTube recorded 1.5 billion monthly viewers watching 60 minutes of videos each day on their phones and tablets. To monetize this base, Alphabet is offering more six second pre-roll ads, which has increased the ad viewability rate from 66% to 95%. Additionally, it plans to launch more than 40 original shows for its subscription service.

Alphabet stock is currently trading at $1,016.64 with a market capitalization of $709.6 billion. It touched a record high of $1,048.39 earlier last month. It was at a 52-week low of $727.54 in November last year."
2017-10-23T14:30:00-05:00,"Sidewalk Toronto will be the first real-world attempt by Google's parent company to optimize city life

Waterfront Toronto, a district established in the city in 2001, will be the site of the first Sidewalk Labs city. Sidewalk Labs is the urban planning arm of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. This means the streets of Waterfront Toronto will soon be filled with sensors and the city will continuously evolve into different forms moulded primarily by data streams.

The project, also called Sidewalk Toronto, will more or less be Alphabet’s playground where it can put together the city of its dreams. For mobility, Wired reports that Sidewalk Labs will be tapping Waymo, the autonomous vehicles arm of Alphabet, to fill the streets of Waterfront Toronto with self-driving carriages.

Sidewalk Toronto will be a self-contained community, with ample residential quarters, offices and commercial spaces. The 3.3 million square feet of development will begin near the water at Quayside. This area will be the proof of concept and when successful, Sidewalk Toronto will expand to other areas of the city. Excitement for the future isn’t just from Alphabet. The Canadian government has earmarked $1.25 billion CAD toward the construction of flood control facilities and other critical infrastructure for the district. Sidewalk Labs has volunteered $50 million.

Sidewalk Labs has already identified a few key problems in urban housing it wants to solve. This includes affordability, energy efficiency and transportation. For affordability, its phrase “adaptable buildings” hints towards buildings that are multi-purpose and can change according to need. Innovative construction methods can also lower the cost of housing in Quayside and counter the rise of housing prices in the city.

This data-driven approach to urban planning will finally be tested at scale. Waterfront Toronto can either be a model or a lesson for the future’s smarter cities. The team on the project has scheduled a town hall meeting on November 1 to discuss its plans with the community."

2017-11-02T10:52:40-05:00,"With the wind at its proverbial back both off and on the price chart, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ) is undoubtedly a stock to go long in. But if you’re like me, you appreciate hedging your risk to increase your chances of success, and a bull call spread on GOOGL stock is the favored strategy once again.

I think a recent article by InvestorPlace’s Luke Lango does a good enough job of summing up why GOOGL stock should be on investors’ radars for the long-term game. Alphabet delivered in spades on the bottom- and top-line metrics last week when it announced its Q3 results.

GOOGL saw improved and strengthening growth prospects from mobile and YouTube advertising, as well as increased traction in the company’s cloud business as it flexes some muscle against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) and its AWS unit. But Alphabet also has other growth initiatives underway ranging from Nest and the Pixel smartphone, to the company’s autonomous vehcial unit Waymo.

These are exciting times for Alphabet and the future looks terrific as well. Furthermore, with GOOGL stock attractively priced relative to its peers, the broader market and by those “wiggly lines” on the price chart, it’s also a good time to get long with increased confidence and reduced risk.

It has been just over a month since I last wrote about GOOGL stock. In the process, a constructive-looking base produced an even better-looking breakout to all-time-highs from a cup-shaped or “W” style base following earnings.

Looking forward, and with Alphabet shares confirming a strong position off the price chart, my view is to take advantage of an overall solid situation. As a bullish options trader this means designing a strategy to capitalize on higher prices as GOOGL stock is just marginally above the breakout level and in strong position to rally to new highs."
2017-10-24T06:27:10-05:00,"If you want to know why Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ) was willing to pony up $1 billion to invest in unprofitable ride-sharing venture Lyft, the dots aren’t too tough to connect. The decision was one part message, one part revenge and one part “just good business.” Though news of the deal didn’t affect the GOOGL stock price (and won’t likely do so in the foreseeable future) current and would-be owners of Google stock may want to read between the lines.

In many regards, this partnership with Lyft may be signaling the near-readiness of Alphabet’s self-driving car technology.

And something else curiously happened in the meantime to underscore the premise.

On the off-chance you’re reading this but still haven’t heard, a few days ago ride-hailing company Lyft garnered $1 billion in funding from Alphabet, in exchange for a seat on Lyft’s Board of Directors; David Lawee will be assuming that role.

It’s a curious development to some owners of GOOGL stock, only because Alphabet has long been an investor of Lyft rival Uber, even co-developing self-driving car technologies that could ultimately power Uber’s fleet.

On the surface it seems as if Alphabet is merely hedging its bet. By teaming up with two companies rather than just one that could potentially tap its autonomous car project called Waymo, which has been working on self-driving tech for years now. Alphabet needs to catch up with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ), and is also seeking to keep Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) at bay. The former already has autonomously-driven cars on the road, while the latter is still working on it (though Apple’s self-driving project has shrunk in scope).

There’s more to it than that, however. The Lyft partnership is also one that’s apt to be much less of a headache than the one scandal-ridden Uber has been for its investors for months now.

Chief among those scandals, of course, is now-former CEO Travis Kalanick being forced to step down after credible allegations of sexism and sexual harassment. Even beyond that though, Uber’s boardroom has been more than a little chaotic, so much so that it’s serving as a distraction the unprofitable organization just doesn’t need right now.

Passing along $1 billion to a much smaller but a much better managed Lyft (Alphabet only provided $250 million to Uber several years ago) may be a message to Uber and other potential partners. Alphabet easily could be signaling that at the very least the search giant’s capital-providing arm CapitalG expects its partners to be grown-ups.

Then there’s the not-so-small legal wrangling between Uber and Alphabet.

The short version of a long story: Uber allegedly recruited some of Alphabet’s top engineers with the primary intent of stealing the company’s trade secrets. The trial is expected to start in December. The strain on the relationship has been palpable.

It’s tough to imagine Alphabet not winning that legal battle, even if only because it can outspend Uber."
2017-10-30T19:24:15Z,"We’ve written two pieces of analysis on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG), the parent company of Google. The first examined long term threats to the core business model and revenue generator of the company, search advertising, while the second examined the potential for its “Other Bets” portfolio to yield returns over the long run.

Google has been an incredibly dominant player in advertising on the web for years. Its revenue continues to grow in the double digits in percentage terms year on year, and it remains the crucial revenue provider that keeps Alphabet growing. The Google arm provided 99.1% of Alphabet’s revenue in 2016, making the two companies virtually indistinguishable.

Alphabet now has an earnings release scheduled for 26 November. This article examines what can be expected from that release, and the implications of any surprises.

Alphabet posted an adjusted earnings per share figure of $9.57, sailing past estimates that were closer to the $8.33 mark based on consensus figures published by Thomson Reuters prior to the announcement. A lot of this comes from the company continuing to grow its top line at a breakneck pace. Despite an expected revenue figure of around $27.2 billion, actual revenue for the quarter ended up coming in at nearly $27.8 billion, beating estimates by over half a billion dollars. As expected, the main driver of this success was core Google advertising revenue, which grew by over $4 billion year-over-year. YouTube also appears to be having success in some key metrics, with reports that viewers now watch more than 100 million hours of video every day on the platform. This is a year-on-year increase of around 70%, though investors are still unsure as to whether YouTube is producing healthy returns for Alphabet as a whole. Reports in 2015 that YouTube was not generating any profit have not been overcome in the time since then.

In response to the release, Alphabet’s share price soared past the $1,000 mark during after-hours trading, and currently sits at $1,033.67 for Class A stock and $1,019.27 for Class C stock. In total, Alphabet is performing better than it did in the same quarter of 2016, with a surge in revenues of nearly 25%. During that quarter, reported revenue was around $22.5 billion while adjusted earnings per share were around $7.25, a significant amount lower than the results for 2017.

Cost-per-click appears to be worsening at a faster rate than expected, clocking in with an 18% decline, versus expectations of a drop closer to 16%. Meanwhile traffic acquisition cost came in at around $5.5 billion, against an expected figure of closer to $5.2 billion. Part of this represents what investors believe is a greater cost involved in getting Apple to make Google the default search engine on their iOS devices: By some accounts, this arrangement alone is now costing Google around $3 billion a year. The total increase in traffic acquisition costs comes to a substantial 54% quarterly.

The Other Bets portfolio continues to make a loss, though this figure continues to narrow under the sharp leadership of Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat. This division, which is responsible for Alphabet projects like Nest, X and Waymo reported an operating loss of just over $800 million. This was amidst a revenue increase of over 50% year-on-year, coming to around $300 million. The operating loss figure was over $860 million for the equivalent quarter during the previous year. Despite the substantial progress, the Other Bets division continues to account for only 1% of all the revenue that Google rakes in, while its advertising revenue figure comes it a close to $30 billion on its own.

The earnings report has also showed that Other Bets can continue to rake in more revenue and narrow the loss it makes in each period. Importantly, Alphabet’s Other Bets division cannot be looked at on its own when assessing the contribution it makes to the parent company’s profitability. Much of the research that takes place in divisions outside of Google’s core business does not create revenue directly, but rather benefits Google’s ability to increase earnings or keep costs down. For example, the acquisition of artificial intelligence firm DeepMind has contributed to reducing the substantial power costs incurred by Google at their data and information processing centers. Such large banks of computers require a huge amount of energy to run and keep cool, and huge inefficiencies end up costing the company billions.

By applying DeepMind’s capabilities to the complex interplay of cooling systems, windows and other mechanisms, the company was able to achieve a 40% reduction in electricity use in cooling. Overall, this saves 15% of total power costs, which amounts to several hundred million dollars of the course of several years. Despite this, it is good to have a self-sustaining division and it’s good news that the Other Bets business is heading towards profitability on its own.

This is also the first earnings release since the significant release of the Pixel 2 smartphone, a vehicle by which Google hopes it can crack into the smartphone industry for data collection purposes. The smartphone release has been beset with a range of problems at a bad time for Google as it attempts to establish a reputable brand in the hardware industry. Pixel phones have experienced problems with their displays, including burn-in and muted colours, as well as producing a high pitched noise. In total, however, these sales represent a very small proportion of the total revenue for the firm.

Alphabet’s earnings in the recent past have been hampered by litigation costs, as well as a huge anti-trust fine imposed on the company by the European Commission, which cut significantly into the firm’s bottom line. In total, profits fell by nearly 30% in the previous quarter as a result of this decision, without which profits would have increased by roughly the same proportion. This blip does not change the fact that Alphabet holds a prime position in many emerging high-growth markets, including the cloud, mobile payments and artificial intelligence.

Overall, this has been a very impressive earnings report from Alphabet. It shows the ongoing strength of its core sources of revenue are more robust than analysts anticipated, and importantly demonstrated that their bottom line need not suffer even as key metrics worsen. Several other areas look promising, including its Other Bets portfolio, and the company’s immense valuation is probably justified given the company’s outlook going forward.

2017-10-18T18:59:03Z,"The current value of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stocks' Beta coefficient is clear negative factor for stock returns.

I am convinced that Seeking Alpha readers are good at financial terminology and clearly understand the notion of Beta coefficient. But in order to avoid discrepancies let's plunge into some theory.

Beta is a measure of the volatility or systematic risk of a security in comparison to the market as a whole. In other words, Beta evaluates how much the share price is prone to change in one direction with the market.

Just a simple example: if Beta coefficient value of some US company stocks equals to 1, the increase/decrease of S$P 500 to 1% will be accompanied by average increase/decrease of this company stocks' price to 1%. If Beta coefficient value, equals to e.g. 0,5, the increase/decrease of S$P 500 to 1% will be accompanied by increase/ decrease of this stock to 0,5%.

It is hard judging about the reasons of such notion, but the fact is that Beta coefficient value for the companies from FAAMG list this year is over average level and tends to grow:

It consequently arises the issue about the importance of Beta coefficient value influence to company stocks' return and if this factor is worth paying attention during investment decision making?

Finding the answer to this issue and researching Alphabet shares price fluctuations I came to the following.

First of all I calculated the following two indices: 365-day rolling return and Alphabet stocks rolling beta coefficient value. Both indices are present at the following diagram:

Let me explain. Each blue point stands for the Beta coefficient value of Alphabet stocks for previous 365 and each red point stands for total return value of Alphabet shares for previous 365 days.

Next, I have calculated these values correlation. The result has proved to be rather definitive. Check diagram:

As you can see it shows sustainable inverse interdependence between Alphabet stocks' return and Beta coefficient value, excluding abnormal period of 2014 - i.e. the past growth of Beta coefficient value for Alphabet stocks has nearly always been accompanied by stocks' return decrease and vice versa. While the most up-to-date data confirm that this inverse interdependence stands at the level of nearly 50%.

In order to make result more clear I have created scatter diagram where I put 365-day rolling return (Y axis) value depending from 365-day rolling Beta coefficient (X axis) value for the period starting from 2015.

Latest diagram irrevocably confirms that in most cases the growth of Alphabet stocks' Beta value is accompanied by their return decrease. Bear in mind that 365-day rolling return of Alphabet stocks has been above zero within last two years if Beta value didn't exceed the level of 0,9. Moreover current Beta value of Alphabet stocks is drastically close to this level. And just the opposite situation: the highest return of Alphabet stocks has been detected when Beta value had diapason minimum level.

Internet is full of industry experts' assessment of US stock market overheating and I think that the situation with Beta coefficient value partially confirms this thesis. In any case this factor negatively influences Alphabet stocks, so the investor purchasing company stocks for short-term speculative purposes should take it into account.

P.S. Generally I am interested at this topic and I plan on doing this kind of research for each company from the FAAMG list and make broader conclusions in one of my next articles.

2017-10-26T04:21:00-05:00,"(RTTNews.com) - Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ) announced earnings for its third quarter that climbed compared to the same period last year.

The company said its bottom line totaled $6.73 billion, or $9.57 per share.

This was up from $5.06 billion, or $7.25 per share, in last year's third quarter.

The company said revenue for the quarter rose 23.7% to $27.77 billion. This was up from $22.45 billion last year."
2017-10-24T09:01:10Z,"A whole quarter has come and gone, and we are back at square one.

After a solid 2Q17 that sent shares down nearly 10% in the four weeks following the July report, Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) stock recovered some ground in September, only to return to trading at the same $980/share of three months ago. With 3Q17 earnings looming in the horizon, can GOOG breach what seems to be a hard ceiling of $1,000/share for the first time ever?

The reader might remember that, last quarter, the Street shrugged off Alphabet's solid results on what seemed to be one (or a combination) of a few factors:

Regarding the first two items, I believe the moderate headwinds to be ""sticky"" and properly reflective of Alphabet's current business environment. They are not, in my view, one-off items that are unlikely to repeat going forward. I suspect that the irreversible trends towards mobile usage, which bodes ill for Alphabet's revenues on a per-click basis, will continue to put pressure on CPC. Also, top-line growth initiatives are likely to push TAC further up, as seems to be supported by CFO Ruth Porat's claims that Alphabet is ""focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins"".

On the other hand, I have no good reason to believe that paid clicks will face any significant headwinds in the quarter, after the metric picked up the growth pace in 3Q17 at an impressive +52% on an aggregate level. Therefore, I believe Alphabet has a good chance of at least meeting consensus expectations, even if the price-unit mix (i.e. clicks vs. cost per click) or the op margins on the ad business side might not please all in the investment community.

Regarding the third item, GOOG continues to trade at a similar multiple to mid-July's 32.5x (right before the -10% pullback), and at much richer levels than last year's 23x. For that reason, the bar may once again have been set high, and it is possible that only more impressive results coming out of the press release might be able to provide uplift to the stock in the short term.

How the Street will react to Alphabet's earnings results this week remains to be seen. But I prefer to think about the company and its stock from a longer-term perspective. On that front, I see Google's parent as more than an ad revenue generator, but also as a cutting-edge tech developer and a venture capital and private equity fund manager that I believe will aggregate value for investors over the coming years.

2017-10-24T08:12:00-05:00,"Chicago, IL - October 24, 2017 - Zacks Equity Research highlights Adobe ADBE as the Bull of the Day and Tesla TSLA as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  Alphabet Inc . GOOGL .

Here is a synopsis of all three stocks:

On October 18,  Adobe hosted a financial briefing with investors and analysts at its Adobe MAX user conference in Las Vegas. There management unveiled the company's growth strategy and outlook for the coming fiscal year beginning December 1. 

 



While Adobe's September 19 report for their fiscal Q3 (ended August) delivered record revenues and a modest 10% earnings beat that inspired analysts to raise EPS estimates slightly for next year, the new financial guidance last week compelled another 4.5% jump in the EPS consensus for 2018 to $5.38.Highlights of the event included these projections from the company...Adobe's total addressable market (TAM) for all divisions will hit $83 billion by 2020Revenue growth of 20% to $8.7 billionDigital Media segment revenue growth of 23%Adobe Experience Cloud subscription revenue growth of 20%Adobe Experience Cloud total revenue growth of 15%GAAP earnings per share of $4.40Non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.50 representing approximately 30% growthDigital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue (""ARR""): approximately $1 billion of net new ARRAdobe Experience Cloud bookings: approximately 20 percent annual growthHere's what I told my TAZR Trader subscribers in June when we bought ADBE shares under $145...It's not even a Zacks #2 Rank yet, but it will be soon after this week's earnings beat and guide above consensus on both sales and EPS. The valuation is rich, but this company has uniquely embedded itself in the creative, marketing and publishing needs of corporate America. Bank of America posted the highest price target raise at $184, Piper Jaffray moved to $180, and JPMorgan upped theirs to $170.And here was more news this week for our premier ""creative digital-studio SaaS powerhouse"" that will further embed their platform in ad agencies, media platforms, and corporate in-house branding infrastructure...Adobe Systems Incorporated today announced it has acquired all SkyBox technology from Mettle, a global developer of best-in-class 360-degree and virtual reality software. The acquisition comes at a time when increasing numbers of creators, global brands and media and entertainment companies are embracing 360/VR and are looking for seamless, end-to-end workflows for this new, immersive medium. The Skybox toolset is designed exclusively for post-production in Adobe Premiere Pro CC and Adobe After Effects CC and complements Adobe Creative Cloud's existing 360/VR cinematic production technology. Adobe will integrate SkyBox plugin functionality natively into future releases of Premiere Pro and After Effects.(end of June 22 TAZR commentary excerpt)Unfortunately, I gave up on ADBE by mid-August as it seemed that investors were just not willing to pay much more than a 30X multiple for being what I called an embedded ""creative digital-studio SaaS powerhouse.""Me of little faith. Investors and analysts were jolted by the Adobe presentation in Las Vegas last week and the next day ADBE shares jumped over 12% from $153 to $172.And Wall Street investment bank ratings and price targets jumped as well...



 To understand the digital media growth opportunities, and the product/technology platforms that Adobe will use to capitalize on them, I highly recommend visiting their investor relations website to view the October 18 slide deck with all the details. 

 

 Until then, definitely look for dips to buy ADBE. But I don't see it filling the gap back to $153 any time soon, so have a plan ready to buy under $170.

Tesla has once again slipped to a Zacks #5 Rank as earnings estimates got ahead of themselves and then were recently dialed back.



 To be fair, this business is quite the moving target for analysts and the variance of outlooks among them is large. 

 

 For instance, Bank of America and JPMorgan analysts have price targets of $155 and $195, respectively, while Piper Jaffray and Guggenheim analysts hold $386 and $430 targets. 

 

 Further amidst the bulls, it's worth noting that Morgan Stanley just raised their PT from $317 to $379 this month, and long-time faithful bulls at Robert Baird reiterated their $411 target last month. 

 

 But one investor towers above them all. Money manager Ron Baron, whose family of a dozen funds oversees $25 billion, has been a long-time Tesla bull and when he made an appearance on CNBC this summer he reiterated his call for TSLA shares to soar... 

 

 ""I think it is going to be about $500 to $600 next year, and I think it is going to be $1,000 in 2020."" 

 

 Baron obviously sees Tesla as being a significant force in the auto industry. And he's a savvy long-term investor who is good at spotting consumer and technology trends. 

 

 In fact, I followed his lead in Mobileye, the Israeli maker of Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) machine learning technology, before  Intel  bought the company for $15 billion this year. 

 

 Let's take a closer look at the near-term doubt about Baron's view. 

 

 Where's the Growth? 

 

 Some of the bulls had expected Tesla to turn consistently profitable in 2018. Others have anticipated production delays with the new Model 3 and see the company as able to deliver its first profitable year in 2019. 

 

 The shifting sands here are typical not only of a new car company but also of one with such a transformational business model.   

 

 What the bulls hope is that Model 3 demand will be strong and that Tesla is able to generate 25% gross margins on the vehicle at a price point in the mid-$40,000s. 

 

 Despite the big Q2 earnings beat in August which helped propel shares back to the all-time highs above $385 that were first achieved in June, earnings estimates have been headed down. 

 

 Two months ago, the consensus EPS projection for this year was a loss of $6.39. That has since fallen back to ($6.84). 

 

 The 2018 consensus dropped from a loss of $1.12 to ($1.23) in the past 60 days. 

 

 Oppenheimer analysts felt compelled to drop their 2017 EPS estimate from ($4.95) to ($7.02). 

 

 And yet they remain in the camp of seeing a profitable 2018, sticking with their far-above-consensus profit projection of $1.64 next year.

Shares of Alphabet Inc. were down more than 1.5% in early afternoon trading Monday, just days before the Google parent is scheduled to release its Q3 earnings report. Right now, Alphabet seems to be dealing with hardware concerns related to its new Pixel 2 phones, but investors should certainly still expect the company's earnings announcement to hog the headlines this week.

While a shift to mobile computing once threatened Google's traditional search business, management has successfully adapted to changing consumer trends by expanding its operations into nearly every corner of the modern tech world.

Today, Google and the other subsidiaries under the Alphabet umbrella sit on the cusp of dominance in several booming industries, including cloud computing, mobile payments, ecommerce, and artificial intelligence. Of course, search is still the company's bread and butter, but there's plenty more to be excited about if you're an Alphabet investor right now.

Shares of GOOGL have gained nearly 27% year-to-date, and the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). What's more, Alphabet has met or surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four out of the five trailing quarters. Plus, with the stock's positive Earnings ESP of 1.77%, investors can feel more confident about the possibility of another earnings beat.

Heading into Alphabet's report date, our current consensus estimates are calling for the company to post earnings of $8.39 per share and revenues of $21.94 billion. While GOOGL's profits are projected to slump about 7.4% year-over-year, the company's top line growth is expected to hit an impressive 20.1%-underscoring the potential for its expansion efforts to pay off down the line.

Of course, earnings and revenue are just two of the many things investors will be looking at when Alphabet reports on Thursday.

First up, we should note that Google's advertising revenues are projected to swell by more than 18% in the quarter. Interestingly enough, Google's ad business has been a cause for some concern over the past few years. Advertisers tend to value mobile ads less, so a shift to a mobile-first world meant lower cost-per-click figures for Google.

Nevertheless, growth in total paid clicks has outpaced the decline in cost-per-click and led to rising advertising revenues. Last quarter, Alphabet narrowly edged our consensus estimate in this category and notched growth of 18.4%. If the company's core business can outperform our expectations again, investors should be ecstatic.

Still, Alphabet's most exciting growth prospects come from its ""Google other revenues"" category. This unit includes revenues from the company's Google Play Store, as well as its Google Cloud offerings and hardware initiatives.

Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Alphabet to report Google other revenues of $3.43 billion. That would represent growth of more than 41% from the $2.43 billion recorded in the year-ago period.

Finally, we should see impressive growth in Alphabet's mysterious ""Other Bets"" unit. The company uses this segment to lump together its smaller projects, and for the most part, these projects don't generate much revenue.

But some of the Other Bets subsidiaries-including Google Fiber, Nest, and Verily-are adding to Alphabet's top line. According to our consensus estimates, we expect Alphabet to report Other Bets revenues of $267 million this quarter, up from the $197 million seen last year.

Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.

With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.

2017-10-23T21:42:03Z,"A few days ago, I argued that Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 8 series was probably a decoy, and iPhone X and iPhone 7 were really the products the company was trying to sell. Although it's still early days, recent reports seem to confirm this theory. Apple's latest pricing strategy in some measure is a replica of the past. In 2014, it tried to segment its user base by introducing the iPhone 6 Plus at a $120 premium. In its endeavor to capture the more affluent and technophile smartphone user base with the iPhone X, Apple seems to have exposed a chink in its armor - a weak product in the $649-849 price band. The Pixel 2 series sells near that range and is as good, if not better, than the iPhone 8, opening up the game for Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to make some decent gains next year.

The shrinking divergence in the user experience of premium Android phones and the iPhone is a key reason why I think Apple may taste limited success with its latest maneuvering on pricing. Remember the time when the iPhone had a clear edge over its Android peers? Well, it is hard to say that today. This is especially true in the $649-849 segment, where the iPhone is pitted against some really good smartphones. The iPhone X probably offers a different user experience, but it also comes at a steeper cost. We are therefore narrowing this analysis for phones within the $649-849 segment.

Based on the segment defined above, I have shortlisted a relatively similar set of phones. I say ""relatively similar"" because if you look at the reviews of these smartphones, there is no consistency in how they are ranked. It differs from one reviewer to another. Note that I am not segmenting phones based on their storage capacity. The manufacturers price them that way.

A key question one may ask is whether I'm ignoring the loyal brand buyers in this analysis. It is a fair question, but look at it from the vantage point of the Pixel 2 series. The Pixel has to penetrate the more fickle consumer base before appealing to the blind believers of Apple. How big can this consumer segment be? The Pixel entered the market last year and showed that even under its flawed distribution architecture, it could find more than a million users willing to test a new brand (considering Pixel as a new brand and ignoring the Nexus lineup). And as the perception of improvement from new product cycles drops, I think this flaky market has room to become wider. In the short to medium term, who wins the market share of less devoted fans becomes the difference between an earnings beat and an earnings miss. In the long run, the consequences could be fairly serious.

When we look at the pricing and the way Google segments the Pixel lineup, it is clear that it follows a dominant strategy for Pixel 2. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are essentially the same phones with different screen sizes. Similarly, the preference for Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) S8 versus S8 Plus largely boils down to how big your hands are. The features of iPhone 8 Plus, on the other hand, are better than that of the iPhone 8. When we look at the pricing in the 64 GB internal storage capacity, the Pixel 2 offers a better features to price payoff relative to the S8 and the iPhone 8 series. Pixel 2 also has a dominant payoff against the iPhone 7 series. The dominant payoff is in the form of better features, the attribute of being a new model, higher internal storage capacity (against 32 GB) and the complimentary Google Home Mini being offered along with the phone.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 has a 5.8"" screen size, which is almost as large as the Pixel 2 XL (6"") and bigger than the iPhone 8 Plus (5.5""). With the flexibility of an expandable memory, the S8's price point is a dominant strategy against consumers only considering larger-sized models. As seen in the table above, this dominance increases as the internal storage capacity of iPhone 8 Plus and Pixel XL increases.

Interestingly, there also is a clear loser in the game where only larger-screen sized phones are in contention. And that is the Pixel XL. I say interesting because Google is the last to launch its products. The pricing strategy of its competitors is revealed to it before the Pixel launch. Is the company intentionally trying to suppress demand for the Pixel XL? Does that highlight a problem within its distribution architecture? Given how secretive Google is, I doubt we will ever know.

If there was a year where the Pixel could get a bump in market share purely because of an easier competitive landscape, this is probably it. It's not that it will be smooth sailing for Google, as there are a few home-grown problems of its own. A phone persistently out of stock won't sell well, and to that end Google shareholders may hope that the firm does not encounter the supply chain problems that cropped up last year.

2017-10-18T13:31:20-05:00,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average is getting a jump today as International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: ) shares are trading almost 10% higher after better-than-expected earnings results. The move isn’t as strong in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite as the broader markets are moving sideways. The string of new highs on the major exchanges is starting to push a number of stock charts into overbought territory ahead of their earnings reports. We’ve noted a swing of funds into the technology stocks over the past two weeks as results from the financials haven’t impressed.

Being aware of the “sell the rumor” rule, today’s Three Big Stock Charts looks at the technical of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: ) as all three are flashing short-term overbought signals.

Alphabet shares have rallied over the last month as a migration into large-cap tech stocks has taken place ahead of earnings. The stock now sits at a critical test ahead of its earnings release on Oct. 26. The next week may see a “sell the news” pullback ahead of this report according to the current chart.

With shipments of PCs on the rise, Microsoft and other hardware companies have seen a tailwind that has helped shares rally into their earnings reports. Microsoft is set to release earnings in a little over a week on Oct. 26. The current chart suggests that we may see some selling ahead of the report."
2017-10-20T09:49:37-05:00,"Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ) Google should be enjoying this moment. The company has just launched the highly anticipated follow-up to its Pixel smartphone. Rival Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) is facing lower than expected iPhone 8 sales and production challenges as it prepares to launch the iPhone X.

Now should be Google’s time to shine. Instead, it’s putting out fires. Reviews of the flagship Pixel XL 2 have been savaging its apparent poor display quality. To make matters worse, the vendor selling the Pixel 2 at Google pop-up shops has been overcharging customers.

It’s a lot of bad press at a time when Google was expecting to be basking in accolades and notching big sales numbers. Instead, in the two days since the reports of the Pixel XL 2’s display woes have been published, GOOGL stock has been down as much as 1.44%.

The Pixel 2 XL has an OLED display. Compared to a traditional LCD display — like that used in all iPhones up to and including the iPhone 8 — it’s thinner, supports curves, should be more power efficient and it should look a lot better. OLED displays produce much darker blacks than LCD can, leading to a much more vivid and visually appealing picture. They pop.

The Pixel 2 XL display should put the iPhone 8 Plus to shame. Instead, Google’s flagship smartphone is being described in reviews as having a display “that makes me scream every time I have to look at it.”

The problem is that with the Pixel 2 XL, Google went with a new OLED technology called POLED, from LG. It’s a new competitor in the smartphone space to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: ), which used to be the sole supplier with its AMOLED displays. However, POLED is having some teething issues. LG’s own new flagship smartphone the LG V30 is equipped with the same POLED display and it’s being called out as a “deal-breaking flaw.”

The complaints about the Pixel 2 XL display include a noticeable green or blue tint, washed out colors and graininess or patterns in solid colors.

The smaller Pixel 2 is not seeing these complaints. Why? It uses a Samsung AMOLED display.

Pixel 2 XL display issues are one thing, but Google is also shooting itself in the foot at the Pixel 2 launch. At least its launch partners are. Pop-up stores in New York and Los Angeles are selling the new Pixel phones, along with new Google hardware. They are being run by a Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: ) reseller, but are reportedly staffed by Google employees and customers get their purchase in a Google bag. The pop up stores have been charging an extra $30 on the price of all the Google Pixel 2 phones.

Technically, it’s not Google at fault here, but to customers, it looks very much like a Google snafu."
2017-11-08T15:55:47Z,"Salesforce recently announced it's going to use a cloud service beside of Amazon's (AMZN) AWS alone, choosing Google Cloud Platform for a part of its cloud needs.

Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been looking for revenue streams outside its dominant ad platform, based upon the risk associated with reliance on one major revenue source. With the ad business susceptible to significant downturns in weak economic times, Google wants to get ahead of this before the next recession hits.

To that end it has been working on developing its cloud business, although some in the market have questioned its commitment to the endeavor. With the Salesforce win, it appears to give credibility to Google's assertions it still wants to grow it as part of its overall business strategy.

Google remains a distant third in the competitive cloud market, behind AWS in the No. 1 spot, followed by Microsoft Azure in second place.

The primary element of the deal between Google and Salesforce is that it'll be the core cloud service used for international infrastructure by the company. With Salesforce ramping up its service to compete in the global markets, this has the potential to be a long-term, lucrative deal for Google, assuming the success of Salesforce's international expansion.

Among the integrations between Google and Salesforce will be Quip tying into Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Hangouts, among other services.

Salesforce will embed its Quip Live Apps into Google Calendar and Google Drive. Part of the Hangout integration will be the use of customer data being able to be used from Salesforce CRM. Salesforce CRM will also be integrated with G Suite.

Users will have access to Google Analytics 360 and Salesforce Marketing Cloud from one dashboard.

These are the major parts of the deal. There are other integrations as well.

In the latest quarter, the company's Google segment generated revenue of $27.5 billion, an increase of 23 percent over the same reporting period of 2016.

Network revenues jumped 16 percent to $4.3 billion, most of that attributed to accelerated growth from AdMob and programmatic.

Google Cloud Platform's revenue is reported under Other, which as a total, generated $3.4 billion in revenue, a gain of 40 percent. The company said the major catalysts for growth in Other were cloud, play and hardware.

Based upon percentages, the positive news is Other is growing faster than all other parts of the company, and there can be no doubt it's going to soar going forward, now that Google has won the international cloud business of Salesforce. That could easily attract other companies to its cloud service as well.

There are a couple important things to take away from this. First, Google has confirmed it remain serious about growing its cloud business, and second, it positions it to grow its Other business, which should become a major part of its growth narrative in the years ahead, and will be considered a risk reducer by the market, as it becomes a bigger percentage of Google's overall revenue.

This is also confirmed by Google in it last earnings call, where it said it has boosted the total number of workers in its cloud business b6 2,495. The bulk of those new workers are in marketing and technical positions related to its cloud business.

While the success of Google will be aligned with the success of Salesforce internationally over the long term, it should have a solid couple of years of growth as Salesforce gets more aggressive in global markets. How it works out over a period of years will be determined by how well Salesforce competes.

Some of the integrations associated with the deal could take through the second quarter of 2018 to complete, so it's unsure how quickly this will add to the top and bottom lines of Google.

It appears it'll be staggered on a quarterly basis until everything is in place. That should add at minimum incremental growth to the Other unit until the integration is complete, and from then on be a meaningful growth engine for Google.

I think it'll take a year or so before we start seeing full results, which means probably in the fourth quarter of 2018, or the first quarter of 2019.

However, our current consensus estimates call for the tech giant’s quarterly earnings to fall 7.4% to $8.39 per share. Nevertheless, Alphabet’s revenues are projected to jump 20.1% to $21.94 billion, spurred in part by a heightened commitment to new ventures.

Since earnings and revenues account for only a small portion of everything that investors take into account when assessing a company’s quarterly earnings report, it is important to focus in on those new ventures.

Alphabet has invested in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, ecommerce, and mobile payments—all of which are represented in its “Other Bets” unit.

While “Other Bets” does not generate a significant amount of revenue right now, a few of Alphabet’s side projects, including Google Fiber, Nest, and Verily, have started to bear fruit. Based on our consensus estimates, we expect Alphabet’s Other Bets revenues to soar 35% year-over-year to $267 million.

Even if Alphabet’s Other Bets business doesn’t grow as much as we currently project, investors should be excited that the company isn’t resting entirely on its search engine business.

2017-10-23T15:24:27Z,"A capital injection of $1 billion into Lyft by a consortium led by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), announced on October 19 2017, is a strategic waypoint in Google's catalogue of technology-based venture capital funding, and promises significant return to holders of Google's stock.

CapitalG, a venture capital arm of Alphabet, arranged the funding for the transportation network company, and because the cash injection raises Lyft's valuation to $10 billion from the previous figure of $6.9 billion, Google's consortium has already achieved de facto capital risk protection.

Previously, when General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) injected $500 million into Lyft in 2016, this bought them a 9% stake in the company. Therefore by extension holders of Google may expect that the Google consortium secured approximately 18% of Lyft's shares in this latest financing round, worth $1.8 billion at present valuation, and thereby achieving an immediate 80% paper return on investment for the funders.

Beyond this, the medium term ROI for Google's funding is in prospect even more attractive. Lyft is anticipated to undertake an IPO in 2018, and is under some time pressure to do so if it seeks to go to market before Uber and so set a benchmark for a transportation network offering. The price of Lyft's shares will in probability jump significantly on open of market trading, based not least on Google's participation in the company, and showing another sizable paper profit for Google.

Uber, Lyft's larger rival, while planning a public offering, has been slowed in this regard by recent public relations disasters, beginning when a group of investors engineered the departure earlier in 2017 of Travis Kalanick, Uber's co-founder and former CEO, amidst allegations that he was unsuited to lead the company. Timing is everything.

Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has nonetheless declared his intention to undertake an IPO in the next 18 to 36 months, and this should spur Lyft to take early action in order to be the first to go public in order to reap the benefit of initial investor enthusiasm for transportation networks.

Clearly, though, Google's primary interests relating to the Lyft stake are both those of long-term ROI accruing from Lyft's operations, and the synergistic technological and commercial benefit of combining a transportation network with Google's commitment to autonomous autos in the form of its Waymo company.

As a large and defined pool of vehicle purchasers and lessees, Waymo and other car manufacturers who utilize Waymo's autonomous technology will have preferred pre-decisional access to Lyft operators with a view to influencing their vehicle purchasing and leasing decisions. Estimates place Lyft as having in excess of 1.5 million drivers worldwide.

As to the discrete long term growth prospects for a well-funded Lyft, they are distinctly positive when considered in the context of the company's market. Lyft claims that just ""0.5% of miles traveled in the U.S. happen on ride-share networks”, leaving great scope for market development. In early 2017, Uber held an 84% share of the U.S. ride hailing market, declining to 77% in May as users migrated to Lyft. However, even with a minority share, Lyft has very significant revenue potential because of the sheer size of the as yet largely undeveloped market it serves.

Waymo should benefit technologically from a partnership with Lyft, just as General Motors and Jaguar-LandRover envisage through their earlier buy-ins to the company. Integration of cutting edge autonomous vehicle technology into Lyft's fleet aims to speed and refine the evolution of that technology as the autonomous auto manufacturers compile a reservoir of big application data with which to evaluate and improve their systems.

In speaking of Waymo, Google's funding of Lyft will also hedge the risk of monies the company has already invested in Uber, particularly in light of the suit filed against Uber by Waymo in February 2017 for alleged misappropriation of Waymo's Lidar technology concerning the use of pulsed laser light to measure distance. In 2013, Google invested $258 million in Uber.

By investing in both of the major participants in the transportation network market, Google is additionally hedging its bet as to which of the companies will ultimately prove dominant in the space, and is garnering the maximum amount of end-user business from the transportation network segment.

In sum, the investment in Lyft by the Google consortium meets objectives of investment risk reduction, prospective high ROI, synergistic benefits flowing from Lyft's application of Waymo's autonomous technology, and the market-specific hedging of funds already invested in Uber. Consequently, investors in Google should welcome this positive step.

2017-10-19T15:19:39.883Z,"Lyft Inc. raised $1 billion in a deal that values the ride-sharing startup at $11 billion, steps up competition with rival Uber Technologies Inc. and builds ties with internet giant Alphabet Inc.

The new money will help Lyft doubling down on the U.S. market, where it has made gains against Uber but still lags its rival. Alphabet’s growth investment arm, CapitalG, led the round, and David Lawee, a partner at CapitalG, will join Lyft’s board, the startup said Thursday in a blog.

The funding marks a major shift in Alphabet’s allegiances away from Uber, and suggests a tighter pairing of its Waymo autonomous vehicle technology with Lyft’s transportation network.

Lyft has gained market share in the U.S. this year as Uber suffered from executive turnover and self-inflicted wounds, including a protest over the company’s ties to the Trump administration. Lyft seized the moment, donating to the American Civil Liberties Union and issuing a string of progressive political statements.

Bloomberg previously reported Alphabet was considering a $1 billion investment. The internet giant was a major Uber backer, but the companies have clashed over autonomous vehicle technology this year.

The funding is bad news for Uber, which is trying to finalize a major investment from SoftBank Group Corp. Even if the SoftBank deal goes through as expected, a well-financed Lyft is a blow for new Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. On paper, Uber remains the far more valuable company. It was last valued at nearly $70 billion.

Over the past few years, Uber and Lyft have poured money into subsidies and other short-term stimulants of market share growth. Both companies have looked for more sustainable means of outmaneuvering each other. The new financing may reignite the subsidy wars or it could usher in a new era of responsible, albeit well-funded, competition.

GV, another Alphabet investment arm focused on venture capital, co-led a more than $250 million investment in Uber in 2013. David Drummond, Alphabet’s chief legal officer, took a board seat. But the relationship fractured as Uber started working on self-driving cars in competition with Waymo. Alphabet sued Uber for stealing its autonomous vehicle trade secrets in a highly publicized case set to go to court in December.

There’s a long history of technology companies investing in the next generation of upstarts. SoftBank invested in Alibaba. Microsoft Corp. invested in Facebook Inc. Those startups turned into the dominant players in their industries and countries. Ride-hailing supremacy in the U.S. is still up for grabs, with Alphabet placing its latest bet on Lyft, while SoftBank backs Uber.

Uber mulled acquiring Lyft back in 2014. Uber executives scoffed privately that Lyft was only worth $2 billion in 2016. But this year, Lyft has closed the valuation and market-share gap.

Both companies are betting the ride-hailing market will continue to expand dramatically and move beyond the largest cities by weaving itself into the transportation fabric of America’s heartland. Lyft has also flirted with international expansion, while Uber already operates in more than 70 countries."
2017-11-08T12:00:12+00:00,"Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are both Technology companies that recently hit new highs. Naturally, this has created a bit of a stir amongst investors. We will compare the two companies across various metrics including growth, profitability, risk, return, dividends, and valuation to determine if one is a better choice than the other.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) operates in the Internet Information Providers segment of the Technology sector. The company has grown sales at a 19.00% annual rate over the past five years, putting it in the high growth category. GOOGL has a net profit margin of 20.10% and is more profitable than the average company in the Internet Information Providers industry. In terms of efficiency, GOOGL has an asset turnover ratio of 2.03. This figure represents the amount of revenue a company generates per dollar of assets. GOOGL’s financial leverage ratio is 0.21, which indicates that the company’s asset base is primarily funded by equity capital. Company’s return on equity, which is really just the product of the company’s profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage ratios, is 14.30%, which is worse than the Internet Information Providers industry average ROE.

Stock’s free cash flow yield, which represents the amount of cash available to investors before dividends, expressed as a percentage of the stock price, is 0.86. Company trades at a P/E ratio of 35.87, and is more expensive than the average stock in the Internet Information Providers industry. The average investment recommendation for GOOGL, taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts, is 1.80, or a buy.

Over the past three months, Alphabet Inc. insiders have been net buyers, dumping a net of 0 shares. This implies that insiders have been feeling relatively bearish about the outlook for GOOGL. Insider activity and sentiment signals are important to monitor because they can shed light on how “risky” a stock is perceived to be at it’s current valuation. Knowing this, it makes sense to look at beta, a measure of market risk. GOOGL has a beta of 0.92 and therefore an below average level of market volatility.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) operates in the Internet Information Providers segment of the Technology sector. GOOG’s asset turnover ratio is 0.59 and the company has financial leverage of 0.21.

The company trades at a free cash flow yield of 0.87 and has a P/E of 37.45. Compared to the average company in the 34.06 space, GOOG is relatively expensive. The average analyst recommendation for GOOG is 1.60, or a buy.

Alphabet Inc. insiders have sold a net of -49,159 shares during the past three months, which implies that the company’s top executives have been feeling bearish about the stock’s outlook.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) scores higher than Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) on 6 of the 13 measures compared between the two companies. GOOGL has the better fundamentals, scoring higher on growth, profitability, efficiency and return metrics. GOOGL has better insider activity and sentiment signals."
2017-11-07T19:22:30+0000,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo will launch a ride-hailing service with no human behind the steering wheel and has been testing the fully self-driving cars on public roads in Arizona, Chief Executive John Krafcik said on Tuesday.

The test without a human in the driver’s seat is a first in the United States as large tech companies, big automakers and well-funded startups race to develop fully autonomous cars.

While self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the driver’s seat ready to take over if the technology fails.

Waymo said members of the public will begin riding in its fleet of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans without human drivers in a test run of the service in the next few months in certain areas of Phoenix, Arizona, which has dry, predictable weather. Developers are still grappling with vehicle performance in snow or heavy rain.

Members of the public taking part in the company’s trial in Phoenix will be its first customers, using a ride-hailing app.

At first, those passengers will be accompanied in the back seat by a Waymo employee, but eventually they will travel alone, although they will be able to hit a button to stop the car.

It will roll out the service to the wider public at a later date, although it did not say when.

The service will be free at first, but Waymo expects at some point to start charging for rides, a potential way to earn revenue to help offset the steep costs involved in developing the technology.

The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars, unlike California and some other states.

“Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo’s fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,” Krafcik said in prepared remarks after announcing the launch in Lisbon.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not immediately comment on Tuesday but said in September last year that conventionally designed vehicles that can be operated autonomously faced no specific federal legal barrier.

With over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology and has tested its system in six states, the latest being Michigan.

Last week, U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc announced a multiyear partnership for vehicle maintenance and repairs for Waymo’s self-driving car operations.

General Motors Co, which acquired autonomous driving start-up Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion last year, has signaled its intent to test a robotaxi service in the near future.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in October the company aims to take the driver out of its self-driving vehicles “in quarters, not years.” The carmaker’s goal for its Cruise self-driving car unit is to “safely develop and deploy self-driving cars at scale” in dense, urban environments, not suburbs."
11/12/2017 7:24,"The EU is preparing to fine Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with an antitrust penalty over AdSense, its advertising network, with a decision expected in the next few weeks, The Telegraph reports.

It will be the second fine in less than a year. Google was ordered to pay €2.4B in June for abusing its internet search monopoly to promote its online shopping service."
2017-11-17T16:46:30.048Z,"Apple Inc. said its next major new hardware product, the HomePod speaker, is being delayed until early next year, missing the key holiday shopping season.

“We can’t wait for people to experience HomePod, Apple’s breakthrough wireless speaker for the home, but we need a little more time before it’s ready for our customers,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “We’ll start shipping in the U.S., U.K. and Australia in early 2018.”

The HomePod, which streams tunes from Apple Music, takes voice commands via Siri, and controls smart home appliances, was originally announced in June at the company’s annual developer conference. It was scheduled to ship in December, Apple said at the time. It will now go on sale in early 2018, Apple said. CNBC reported the delay earlier.

This is the second year in a row that a major new Apple audio product has been delayed. Last year, the AirPods wireless headphones were held back from an October launch until December.

Smart speakers will be a key focus for the holiday shopping season given the influx of devices coming from other players like Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc., and Sonos Inc. Apple’s accessory business, part of its Other Products segment, is minuscule compared to the iPhone and Services businesses, so the delay is unlikely to materially affect Apple’s earnings. However, missing out on holiday gift purchases could mean some people opt for speakers from other companies, locking them more tightly into rival digital ecosystems.

Next month, Google’s Home Max speaker that likewise focuses on audio quality, and the Amazon Echo Spot, a mini speaker with a screen, go on sale. Earlier this year, Google and Amazon put out a slew of other smart speakers, including a mini version of the Google Home and a model of the Echo with better sound quality."
11/13/2017 11:35,"Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley launches an antitrust investigation into Google (GOOGL, GOOG), accusing the company of violating the state’s consumer protection laws.

The investigation will focus on Google’s collection of user data and whether the search giant manipulated search results to favor its own interests over competitors.

Statement from Hawley, who is up for reelection: “When a company has access to as much consumer information as Google does, it’s my duty to ensure they are using it appropriately. I will not let Missouri consumers and businesses be exploited by industry giants.”

Google has already landed on the bad side of EU antitrust regulators, receiving a €2.4B fine in June for shopping search practices and facing another fine over its AdSense network."
11/15/2017 3:05,"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has reclaimed its spot as the default search engine on Mozilla's Firefox Internet browser in the U.S. and other regions, stunning Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) Yahoo by canceling their deal.

While revenue-sharing terms of the agreement weren't disclosed, recent reports suggest that Google paid Apple a whopping $3B in 2017 for the right to remain the default search engine on iOS."
2017-11-17T15:52:55+0000,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google said it has bought a plot of land in southern Denmark adjacent to a planned Apple Inc data center to make sure it has the option of building one there too.

Apple said in July it would spend around $950 million to build a center with a planned opening in 2019. If Google follows suit it would make the area one of the world’s largest data center hubs, the local municipality Aabenraa said.

“It signals that Google has plans in Denmark, and I think it’s because we have some of Europe’s lowest power prices for companies, some of the greenest energy, and a high security of supply,” he said in a telephone interview.

Facebook in January announced plans to build a data center in Odense in central Denmark, its third outside of the United States.

Besides its new 131 hectare (324 acres) plot in Aabenraa Google also owns a 73 plot in Fredericia, 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Aabenraa.

Google has no plans for the lots yet, but wanted to secure the possibility to expand its data centers in Europe if required, a spokeswoman told Reuters."

2017-11-17T06:27:02-05:00,"At this point, it’s seemingly useless to criticize Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: ). Just prior to its storied initial public offering, I mocked the investment potential of FB stock.

I viewed it as a platform for trendy Millennials and the hopelessly narcissistic. Seeing no fundamental value, I viewed FB like I view Snap Inc (NYSE: ) today: completely pointless.

Needless to say, I was wrong, dead wrong.

Following a sharp dip after the hoopla over the IPO ended, the FB stock price entered into a more than year-long consolidation phase. But since the late summer of 2013, it’s been nothing but blue skies for Facebook.

Contrarians typically view such dynamics as an opportunity to go the opposite direction; so far, FB has defied that concept.

Indeed, long-term investors have been wise to avoid listening to the naysayers. Facebook has answered most of the criticisms it has faced, including its sales and earnings growth potential.

Furthermore, the FB stock price is backed by the ultimate fundamental catalyst: no other social media platform has two billion monthly active users (MAUs).

Better yet, the competition doesn’t come close. President Trump’s favorite platform, Twitter Inc (NYSE: ), averages around 330 million MAUs, despite the White House’s seal of approval.

The fundamentally more useful LinkedIn that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) acquired, claims more than 500 million. In addition, LinkedIn is featured in more than 200 countries listing more than 10 million active job postings.

Impressive, certainly, but it’s roughly a quarter of Facebook’s coverage. That’s the real, awe-striking power of the company, and subsequently, of FB stock.

Still, it’s fair to ask questions about the company’s remarkable rise in the markets. The first item on the agenda is the FB stock price. Its rapidly approaching 55% year-to-date returns, which would make it the second-biggest annual haul in Facebook’s history.

That figure might be surprising to people due to Facebook’s inclusion among the high-flying “FANG” stocks, which also consist of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: ,NASDAQ: ). But when you look at the raw numbers, FB stock doesn’t have the most impressive history.

In its maiden year, the FB stock price gave up 30%. In the following year in 2013, shares rebounded strongly with a 95% return.

Investors have enjoyed double-digit returns every year since, but curiously, the profitability magnitude has declined. The year 2014 saw approximately 43% returns, then 33% and 13%."
2017-11-17T10:03:00.000-0500,"It was a day to remember. Media consolidation finally saw its big day in the news, Thursday, Nov. 16, as so many long-running storylines began to reach their climaxes.

Fueled by the Koch brothers' half-billion dollars or more, Midwest stalwart Meredith Corp. (MDP) looks like it finally has the cash to merge its ""women's marketing"" business with ever-transitioning Time Inc. (TIME) .

The lid flew off Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA) , as bidders began picking apart its long-held assets.

Ziff Davis LLC reportedly pulled Mashable Inc. out of its endless first sale, snapping up the tech blog gone first wild, and then mild, for a mere $50 million.

And as expected, amid the threat of a Federal Communications Commission inspector general inquiry, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai hit the gas on the deregulation throttle, opening the potential floodgates to local broadcast and newspaper consolidation.

Consider it a big day -- but just the beginning of what could be a major turning point in the consolidation of entertainment and news media. The theme common to all the action, whether digital-only or long-standing studio: Get bigger or get out.

Even as Wall Street-listed companies report record profits, making most look like geniuses at the moment, the deeper, and darker, changes afoot in the national-rapidly-becoming-global media markets tell a different story.

The squeeze is on, with content production and distribution costs ever tighter and more competitive than ever. In the entertainment world, it's the Netflix Inc. (NFLX) phenomenon of a digital-only high-flyer upending much of the conventional wisdom about how entertainment gets funded, made, priced and distributed. In the digital business world generally, it's the Google/Facebook duopoly -- a domination that has sunken deeply into the consciousnesses of those who must compete against it and/or run off its distribution power -- that causes generational trepidation.

Today's media business requires -- more than ever -- scale to succeed. One digital era is over when someone with a great, little idea, a Pete Cashmore, who combined the infant worlds of blogging and tech news interest, can see multiplying gains into the horizon.

Today, Cashmore's Mashable must compete with Vox Media Inc., BuzzFeed Inc. and Business Insider Inc., among many, and has simply been left behind. After valuing itself at more than $250 million recently, Ziff Davis reportedly offered a fifth of that mark and will add Mashable's assets to its portfolio of PC Magazine, AskMen.com, Geek.com and ExtremeTech, among others. Scale in operations overall and in targeted ad sales makes the addition worthwhile for Vivek Shah, the former Ziff Davis CEO who was named CEO of parent J2 Global Inc. (JCOM) in September.

It's not just digital startups that hear this changed music.

Fox seemed like a behemoth to many of us, but that's because of Rupert Murdoch's outsized presence and the fact that he still runs the largest news company in the world. His Fox may excel in cable news and sports, but on some bases rings in smallish in TV and film production against the still-bigger producers out there. Time and Meredith both claim status among magazines' Big Four, but both public companies struggle for growth and for digital profit transition. Meredith -- with a stronger core business strategy, that of being a ""women's marketing company"" -- today is the stronger and more disciplined of the two. Yet it believes it needs greater scale -- think of all the additional female uniques it gains -- to compete for those marketing dollars.

Why, and why now? We can point to many reasons, but there's one singular one driving almost everyone: The digital advertising duopoly of Alphabet Inc.'s Google (GOOGL) and Facebook Inc. (FB) -- they take about 90% of all the digital ad dollar growth in 2017 -- drives everyone else in media to run tighter ships.

It's not just Mashable that's feeling the duopoly's heat. The Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported that BuzzFeed, with a digital audience at least five times bigger than Mashable's, would miss its revenue target for 2017 by 15% to 20%, or ""roughly $50 million to $70 million."" At Vice Media Inc., which like BuzzFeed has been connected to a potential initial public offering, similar issues afflict the high-flyer.

Legacy media outlets -- both broadcast and print -- face a double whammy. Their nondigital revenue, largely in TV and newsprint-based advertising, are at best flat and at worst 15% to 20% down this year. Then, as they transition their businesses to digital, that duopoly leaves them -- as well as the BuzzFeeds, Vices and Mashables -- scrambling for the relative crumbs Google and Facebook leave.

So, that FCC decision makes financial sense to those wanting to consolidate. That's why two big industry trade groups -- the National Association of Broadcasters and the newspaper-led News Media Alliance -- lobbied hard for Pai's cross-ownership change, voted in Thursday. That allows the combination of TV and newspaper ownership and operations. While Pai has justified the change citing the wide-open digital communications era, the truth is simpler. Both newspaper companies and TV companies became more valuable Thursday, given their greater salability and ability to be combined to save costs. Cost savings is the first haven for those competing with the power of that Google/Facebook duopoly.

Owners -- of both regional TV operations and of newspapers -- want more scale. They think it's an essential in surviving, and prospering, into the 2020s.

To underline this trend, consider that this year will be the first full year that digital advertising has become the largest ad type in the country -- surpassing the combination of broadcast and cable TV.

And what about the Murdochs' Fox? Both Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) have joined Walt Disney Co. (DIS) in evaluating Fox's ""Twentieth Century Fox studio, some U.S. cable networks and the international business,"" the Journal said. Here, too, we see two words come into play: scale and subscale. Even Fox with its large businesses looks like it is deciding it should either get bigger or sell; it also would be selling the businesses producing the minority of its free cash flow.

Consider Netflix, followed by an onrushing Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , which pulled the pin on this activity. With competition ever tighter and margins more easily squeezed, it's the scale of both production and distribution assets now required of global-distributing entertainment companies that drives this consolidation. Pricing -- at every level -- is up in the air, and it is the pipes companies, with mature but major cash flow, that are chief consolidators of the big of the day.

And Rupert? At 86, he may be selling off one golden goose to buy another. He was born a newsman, and he will likely die as one. One thing his company isn't putting on the bargaining table: Fox News or its regional sports stations. Rupert, as usual, may find himself in all the news of the day, from selling Fox entertainment assets to getting in on the possible land-rush consolidation in local media, a move that regulations -- which he's long fought -- had stymied, until Thursday.

2017-11-17T04:31:51-05:00,"Did you know that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) bought a $240 million stake in Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: ) a decade ago? Microsoft now says it plans to realize some of the gains in its equities portfolio. What does this mean for MSFT stock price?

While Microsoft management didn’t specifically say it would sell any or all of its FB stake, “reading between the lines” suggests that’s the case. At the time, MSFT beat out others — including the since-renamed Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: ) — to invest in FB and garner a 1.6% pre-IPO position. In hindsight, it’s funny to think that management actually had to defend that move at a time Facebook was valued at $15 billion.

By paring back previous equity investments, Microsoft can add those gains to the bottom line. If Microsoft were holding its full position in Facebook, it would be worth billions.

It still might be worth billions, as FB stock is up more than 350% since its 2012 IPO. But Microsoft sold some of its stake in that initial offering and again in 2014. Should the company continue to pare back its holdings in Facebook and others, it would give a boost to its operating income. That boost in operating income could nicely pad the company’s earnings per share.

Now let’s be clear. Microsoft is a $640 billion company. Its major earnings generator is not through sales of earlier investments. But by realizing these gains, it adds padding to the company’s earnings power. In combination with a stock buyback, MSFT could pave the way to countless earnings beats by shedding off some of these positions and reducing the shares outstanding. It’s something to keep in mind when evaluating its future growth profile.

While this strategy could help boost earnings, it wouldn’t do any good if Microsoft’s core businesses weren’t doing well. Specifically, cloud continues to power higher. Intelligent cloud sales jumped 13% while Azure climbed 90%.

In the same period last year, Azure sales more than doubled. So clearly there is a deceleration here. But let’s not forget just how impressive 90% still is. Let’s make it simple: If Azure revenues were $100 million in 2015, 2016 came in at $216 million (up 116%). Now with 90% growth, that puts revenue at $410 million. See how fast that compounds as we went from $100 million to $410 million in just two years? Imagine that growth figure slows to 65% next year. We’re still talking about incredibly strong growth on an increasingly larger base.

With  legacy businesses still turning out decent growth, Microsoft has platforms that began small and are now starting to boom. CEO Satya Nadella has built an incredible company and one that will leverage the cloud with remarkable efficiency. Unlike Alphabet and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: ), it doesn’t need the analytical business from Salesforce.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: ). It can do it on its own."

"Friday, 29 Apr 2016 12:40pm EDT","Alphabet Inc:Google is likely to face its first European Union antitrust sanction this year, with little prospect of it settling a test case with the bloc's regulator over its shopping service, people familiar with the matter said - RTRS.There are few incentives left for either party to reach a deal in a six-year dispute that could set a precedent for Google searches for hotels, flights and other services and tests regulators' ability to ensure diversity on the Web.Alphabet Inc's Google, which was hit by a second EU antitrust charge this month for using its dominant Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals, shows little sign of backing down after years of wrangling with European authorities.Several people familiar with the matter told Reuters that after three failed compromise attempts since 2010, Google has no plan to try to settle allegations that its Web search results favour its own shopping service, unless the EU watchdog changes its stance.Such a change of heart appears unlikely, with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a Dane whose team is leading the Google investigation, showing little interest in reaching a settlement where there is no finding of wrongdoing or a fine against the company, other people said. "
"Wednesday, 27 Apr 2016 08:42pm EDT","Alphabet Inc:Photo agency Getty Images has become the latest company to ask European competition regulators to investigate Google, accusing the Internet search giant of diverting users to its own images service to the detriment of competitors - RTRS.The European Commission has already conducted a number of investigations into Alphabet Inc's Google, and has charged it with promoting its own shopping service at the expense of rivals and also of using its dominant Android mobile operating system to squeeze out competitors.Google has always denied any wrongdoing and said competition is just a click away. On Wednesday, it declined to comment when asked by Reuters about the complaint from Getty Images.Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said the EU competition enforcer would assess the complaint.""When someone has a dominant position, they have a duty not to abuse that dominant position and we feel that Google isn't observing that duty when it comes to images,"" Getty Images Vice President Jonathan Lockwood told Reuters on Wednesday.""We are looking for behavioural remedies. In practical terms, that means wherever a thumbnail image appears on Google Images, and if you do click on it, you go straight to the source website rather than to another page on Google Images,"" he said.The complaint from Carlyle Group-controlled Getty Images is similar to one made by CEPIC, a European association of picture industries and photo libraries. "
