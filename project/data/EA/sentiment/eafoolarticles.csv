            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has seen its stock price soar 150% over the last three years as in-game spending has grown, but the company might have gone too far with this strategy with the newly released Star Wars: Battlefront 2.
EA received a lot of flak from the gaming community due to the game's heavy reliance on in-game purchases to unlock all the licensed Star Wars content, such as getting the chance to play as Yoda or Darth Vader in the game's popular competitive multiplayer game mode. Gamers were disappointed that they had to either spend potentially hundreds of dollars in microtransactions or unlock the content for free only after slogging through hundreds of hours of play time.
EA management heard these concerns and has since temporarily suspended all in-game purchases until the company comes up with a remedy. While it's possible the game may not sell quite as many copies as expected, the issue with Battlefront 2 highlights where the industry is headed and how game companies have to balance generating a profit without upsetting gamers.

The first Battlefront debuted in 2015 and sold 13 million copies in the holiday quarter of that year. In January 2016, EA reported a strong holiday quarter with adjusted (non-GAAP) revenue growing 26% to $1.8 billion, largely driven by strong sales of Battlefront. Battlefront 2 was expected to drive similar strong performance, but that might be up in the air at this point.
Battlefront 2's main appeal is its multi-player competitive game mode. The problem for gamers is that EA designed the game so that players who spend the most money will gain all the best characters and weapons, and, therefore, gain an advantage over their opponents.
As early reviews trickled out and gamers who had pre-ordered got early access to play the game, the game's heavy reliance on microtransactions quickly caused a stir on social media. The general manager of DICE (the studio that created the game), Oskar Gabrielson, released an apology to gamers, stating, ""We hear you loud and clear, so we're turning off all in-game purchases. We will now spend more time listening, adjusting, balancing and tuning.""
Concurrently with that statement, EA stated in an SEC filing that the suspension of Battlefront 2's in-game purchases ""is not expected to have a material impact on EA's fiscal year 2018 financial guidance."" Exactly what ""material"" means is anybody's guess. The game may sell 1 or 2 million copies less over the next month than it would have, but I expect Star Wars: Battlefront 2 to still perform well for EA over the next year once management comes up with a remedy.
The outrage over the game's microtransaction strategy reveals how enthusiastic gamers were to play a game with licensed Star Wars content from Walt Disney's Lucasfilm. Keep in mind, Battlefront 2 is not the only game that has received flak for microtransactions. Take-Two Interactive's NBA 2K18, released in September, also received negative marks from gamers for its aggressive push into microtransactions compared to last year's version, but Take-Two didn't receive nearly as much criticism as EA.
Despite gamers' negative feelings about in-game spending, this is the future of how games will be monetized. Games are getting more expensive to make, with some costing as much as blockbuster movies. The only way big-budget games can be economically feasible for game companies, in the long run, is to sell gamers a steady stream of extra content long after the initial sale.
Mobile games have already been using a microtransaction strategy for a while to generate more profits, and the console game makers are starting to follow suit. Games are transforming more into a service, not just a one-time revenue opportunity at the time of sale.
I expect EA to eventually get this right, but we won't know exactly how this will affect sales until the company reports earnings after the holidays. The bigger problem for EA is that from this point going forward, gamers will be closely scrutinizing every decision EA makes with regards to in-game content.
Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive, in addition to EA, are generating larger amounts of revenue from in-game purchases. Gamers are clearly willing to spend money for this extra content. But as the industry transitions to a new money-making strategy, there's a learning curve for companies. The challenge for game makers is to find a fair amount to ask gamers to spend on extra content for a game that already costs $60 upfront.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) recently announced a partnership with Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) to launch an esports tournament series for the company's popular FIFA video game franchise. This announcement is a deeper push from EA into esports, a fast-growing market within the video game industry that is expected to more than double in size over the next few years to $1.5 billion in revenue.
The FIFA partnership mirrors a similar collaboration EA has with the NFL for its Madden Championship Series. The company releases new versions of these sports titles every year, with FIFA 18 hitting shelves in September and reaching players in 50 countries. As buzz for World Cup 2018 builds, management is using these esports tournaments as a hook to attract new players to the game and increase player engagement.
Image source: easports.com.
FIFA and Madden have been bellwether games for Electronic Arts, and the Ultimate Team digital card game, which generated 17% of revenue in fiscal 2017, will likely grow in importance. EA includes revenue from Ultimate Team in its live service net sales, which increased 22% year over year through the first two quarters of its current fiscal year.
Underpinning growth in live service revenue is player engagement. Madden NFL 18's Ultimate Team player engagement grew 25% year over year in the second quarter. FIFA 18 debuted toward the end of the period, so no details are available yet, but it should post strong engagement numbers as well.
Growth in live services goes hand-in-hand with EA's esports tournaments. The basic idea is to use latter to grow interest and engagement in new game releases. On the company's first-quarter conference call, CFO Blake Jorgensen explained the important link between esports and Ultimate Team digital revenue growth:
You don't get 22% year-on-year growth in live services without the esports power that we've seen in our Ultimate Team business. And I challenge any other console player to demonstrate where they've seen revenue growth of that level coming from esports. It is very powerful for us and it will continue to be very powerful.
During the second-quarter conference call, management reported the number of players participating in online competitive game modes has grown 30% over last year, which bodes well for continued growth in Ultimate Team revenue.
There's also a larger dynamic affecting growth in player engagement: Games are becoming more social and more competitive. This trend is becoming a strong tailwind for EA's esports and Ultimate Team strategy. It's also why game streaming is quickly becoming a multi-billion dollar market. Video games are bridging the gap between the isolated, single-player experiences they used to be with the connectivity of social media.
With Ultimate Team, FIFA 18 players can buy in-game digital cards that randomly generate real-life soccer stars of different skill tiers to build dream teams. These fantasy teams can then be used to compete with other players. Collecting cards is almost a game within a game, and if you want to win, you may end up spending more money on Ultimate Team cards than the initial cost to buy the game itself.
Sales of these digital cards, which require very little cost to distribute, has been a key driver of EA's gross margin expansion over the last several years -- up more than 1,000 basis points to 73.2% through fiscal 2017. As EA's Ultimate Team business continues to grow, margins should continue their upward climb. Management is guiding for gross margin to reach an all-time high of 74.6% for fiscal 2018 as the company's digital distribution strategy continues to develop.
FIFA 18 is one of the most-watched games on Twitch, the game streaming site platform. Electronic Arts' esports strategy, coupled with the marketing buzz of the World Cup next year, will only increase its popularity, and that should translate to a big year for one of EA's most important franchises.

            ","Top video game company Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) recently announced the acquisition of game development studio Respawn Entertainment, the maker of the popular Titanfall franchise, which EA has published under its own label. The news comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Visceral Games, the unit working on a major Star Wars title for EA.
EA will pay $151 million in cash up front for Respawn, with an additional $164 million in long-term equity for employees. There's also a maximum cash consideration of $140 million in incentives dependent upon Respawn's performance through 2022. That's a potential price tag of $455 million for the small developer.

The recent shutdown of Visceral caused some concern among investors, especially since it was working on a Star Wars project that potentially had the makings of another blockbuster release.
However, it's common for major game publishers to contract several studios to work on different projects over time, and EA is no different. In addition to its ongoing work with Titanfall, Respawn is also working on a big-budget Star Wars game for EA, and now it has the resources and support from the industry giant to really excel at its work.
In a recent interview with Venture Beat, the head of Respawn, Vince Zampella, who formerly worked on Call of Duty for Activision Blizzard, explained why Respawn is better off under EA's umbrella:
We see the need for bigger resources to make bigger games that are at the right level of competitiveness. EA has great knowledge for live services stuff that we are looking at and the game industry is transitioning to that.
By ""live services"", Zampella is referring to the in-game content users purchase while playing the game. The video game industry is changing from single-purchase hits to games that generate year-round revenue and profits through a steady flow of updates, including new weapons, character outfits, or completely new story missions or quests.
The industry is also shifting more toward development of online, competitive multi-player titles, as opposed to single-player campaigns. Games are becoming social experiences, and that has the effect of encouraging players to spend money to get that special item to show off their characters or status.
The Respawn acquisition also underscores the shifting economics in the industry. Big-budget games can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to create, which often includes more money spent on the marketing budget than game development itself. With the backing of Electronic Arts, Respawn will have the resources and piece of mind to take risks, two assets that are invaluable in the video game industry. The work on Titanfall will continue, and Respawn hopes to make it even better for gamers in the future. In addition to its Star Wars project, Respawn is also working on another unannounced title, as well as a virtual reality game for Oculus Rift VR headsets.
Since Titanfall will soon be an officially owned EA franchise (the deal is expected to close by the end of calendar 2017 or soon thereafter), there's the possibility that Titanfall or other Respawn projects could be moved around to other studios to best utilize Respawn's talent as EA sees fit.
The $455 million price tag for Respawn is small compared to EA's expected $5 billion in revenue for fiscal 2018, so this acquisition will not have a significant impact on the company's financial results. EA guided in the press release that the acquisition will be neutral to the company's net income for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 ending in March.
But I don't believe EA CEO Andrew Wilson, who has done a phenomenal job of turning the game maker into a cash-generating machine, would make this kind of move if he didn't have major plans for Respawn down the road. This is a big deal for EA that should have a very positive impact on the development of its product pipeline.

            ","Like a fine wine or a family heirloom, the best stocks only get better with age. Investing in great companies will build wealth over the long run that you can pass down to your children and grandchildren. After all, many of today's most valuable companies were just starting up a generation or two ago, so tomorrow's titans of industry are available on the cheap today. If you're looking for stocks that could one day make your children rich, take a look at these three recommendations from three of our Motley Fool investors: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), and Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN)
Image source: Getty Images.
Danny Vena (Netflix): Just 10 years ago, it would have been difficult to imagine the changes that would occur in media consumption over the coming decade, and the birth of streaming has changed the entertainment landscape forever. Netflix started it all, and its investors have been richly rewarded -- and I think it's just the beginning.
Netflix began its international expansion with Canada in 2010. The real revolution, however, happened in 2016 when the company announced its expansion to 130 additional countries simultaneously, growing its worldwide total to over 190 countries and becoming a global media empire in the process. 
In Netflix's most recent quarter, global revenue increased to $2.985 billion, up 30% year over year, while net income reached $130 million, more than double the $52 million achieved during the prior-year period. That wouldn't have been possible without solid customer growth, which continued unabated to 109.25 million total subscribers, up 26% year over year.
The solid growth in new viewers was the result of a continued push for quality content. Netflix dominated this year's Emmy awards, scoring 91 nominations and 20 awards -- more than any other network with the exception of HBO. This is a stunning achievement, considering the streaming giant released its first original series only four years ago.
The key to Netflix's future will be to succeed internationally, but significant penetration in early markets like Brazil and the U.K. show why that success is likely to continue. If you own Netflix, your kids will brag about it someday.
Daniel Miller (Electronic Arts): One stock your kids could grow up to brag about might be a company they become very familiar with in the coming decades -- well, as long as your kid becomes a gamer. Electronic Arts is one of the world's largest third-party video game publishers, and has recently expanded beyond console games to include PC and mobile games. It has well-known titles such as Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield, among others, and the company recently signed a 10-year contract with Disney to develop Star Wars games across all platforms.
The video game maker has done incredibly well for its investors: EA's stock price is up more than 760% over the past five years. But it's the opportunity in eSports and its massive growth that could be an X-factor for the company's future. 
Consider that eSports and other video game broadcasts already attract hundreds of millions of people across the planet, and it's still in the early stages of what could be a lucrative long-term story. As my colleague Keith Noonan points out, some popular eSports events already amass similar viewer numbers as sporting events such as the NBA Finals -- and the audience is more receptive to ads, to boot. 
The truth is simple: Young Americans love to play video games on multiple platforms, and they also love to watch competitive games. However, eSports is such a young growth story, it's not totally clear how EA could end up monetizing the competitive gaming scene.
It's reasonable for investors to expect management to figure it out over the long term. Until that plays out, EA still dominates the sports genre of today's gaming industry and has expanded its top line through mobile and PC gaming, in addition to its console business. If management does figure out how to capitalize on eSports, and perhaps other segments such as virtual reality, Electronic Arts could easily become a stock your kids will brag about owning in two decades.
Jeremy Bowman (Vail Resorts): A great way to get your kids interested in investing is to buy them shares of a company they're already interested in. Vail Resorts presents an appealing investment idea for youngsters who like skiing and snowboarding.
Not only does Vail own some of the premier ski resorts in North America, including its eponymous mountain, as well as Whistler/Blackcomb and Park City, but the company has been a winner for investors, too. The stock is up more than 300% over the last five years and has a number of features that give it a competitive advantage that should ensure it continues to outperform.
Its brand name itself is an asset, as Vail has long been known as one of the best ski resorts in the country, with a glitzy image to boot, and the company's portfolio allows it to offer access through the Epic Pass, which gives skiers and snowboarders unrestricted access to Vail's 15 mountains in North America, as well as 30 European resorts.
With the company's acquisition strategy, those advantages should continue to grow as it adds new properties to the Epic Pass. In addition to acquisitions, the company is also growing organically by amping up its off-season attractions, like ziplines, adventure courses, and a mountain coaster, which should also help improve the bottom line over the long haul.
The preference of millennials for spending money on experiences rather than things should give the company a tailwind, as real-world experiences become more valuable in the e-commerce era. Catch some big air with Vail Resorts. Your kids will thank you for it.

            ","Top video game maker Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) delivered a treat to investors when it reported earnings on Halloween. The new release of Madden NFL 18 helped fuel an acceleration in digital bookings (management's new term for digital revenue) which is now 63% of EA's total revenue over the trailing-12-month period.
Some investors didn't like their treat, with the stock down about 5% following the earnings release. But, as Foolish investors, we're focused on how the business is doing knowing that the stock price will take care of itself over the long term. And from that perspective, EA is performing very well.

The digital distribution trend is sweeping through the video game industry, and this was very evident looking at EA's earnings results. In last year's comparable quarter, digital bookings grew only 1% but accelerated to a 19% growth rate in this year's quarter. On a trailing-12-month basis, digital bookings grew 26% year over year to $3.24 billion.
The largest component of digital bookings is live services, which includes revenue from Ultimate Team, where players can buy in-game card packs for EA Sports titles. Revenue from live services grew 22% for the quarter, driven by Battlefield 1 and Ultimate Team, bringing the trailing-12-month amount to $1.814 billion.
Digital bookings were also driven by strong growth in the number of players choosing to buy Madden NFL 18 directly over console as opposed to buying a physical copy in stores. Full game downloads are better for EA's margins than sales of physical game discs, but it's still a minor percentage of EA's annual revenue. This category grew 28% in the quarter and grew 54% on a trailing-12-month basis, so it won't take long for it to become a key component of EA's annual game sales, helping to fuel margin expansion over time.
The strategy behind EA Sports titles is to funnel gamers to Ultimate Team. This digital card game also serves as the gateway to esports for the company, so it's important to see the digital side of EA Sports titles growing over time.
This year is shaping up to be a very strong year for Ultimate Team which totaled 17% of EA's revenue in fiscal 2017.  FIFA 18's digital portion of total game sales is 25%, up from 16% for the previous version. Same story for Madden, where Madden 18's digital portion of total game sales increased to 34%, up from 25% last year.
A key part of Madden 18's success is a new story mode called ""Longshot"" which tells the story of a struggling college football star's road to the NFL. A similar story mode helped sell more copies of FIFA 17 last year, and it's clearly worked the same charm with Madden players. Management reported an increase of 25% in player engagement for Madden Ultimate Team, which has carried over to a 30% increase in the number of players participating in online competitive matches.
The EA Sports label is an important contributor to EA's business, and Madden is a big part of the company's esports plans, so it's great to see the game continuing to grow year over year in key engagement metrics.
The strength of the company's digital growth caused management to raise its expectations for the full fiscal year ending in March 2018. Management expects bookings to be $5.15 billion, compared to the previous guidance of $5.1 billion. Earnings per share are now expected to be $3.63, up from previous guidance of $3.57 per share.
Management's raise to guidance signals they are expecting a strong holiday quarter. EA has two big releases for November -- Need for Speed: Payback and Star Wars: Battlefront 2. Both titles are getting buzz from the gaming community and are expected to be strong sellers during the holiday season.
This fiscal year is turning out to be a strong one for EA, which gives the game maker a lot of momentum heading into what should be another big year.

Live service net bookings leapt 22% to $310 million, fueled by strong growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Team. Mobile net bookings rose 9% to $150 million, mostly due to the growth of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden Mobile.

""We saw a notable shift to digital in our sports titles and remarkable growth in Ultimate Team,"" CFO Blake Jorgensen said in a press release. ""Our sports titles have once again shown their value in delivering a stable and dependable performance. This quarter demonstrates how they can drive our business and offers a window into how our games will evolve over the months and years to come.""
This shift to digital distribution continues to be a boon to Electronic Arts' business. Management expects gross margin to rise to 74.6% in fiscal 2018, up from 73.2% in fiscal 2017. Importantly, this increased profitability is helping to improve Electronic Arts' cash generation; its operating cash flow over the past 12 months rose to a record $1.8 billion. Moreover, management is committed to returning a significant portion of this cash to shareholders via stock repurchases, including $153 million in the second quarter.
Electronic Arts expects third-quarter net revenue of approximately $1.135 billion and a net loss of $64 million, or $0.21 per share. 
In addition, EA updated its financial forecast for fiscal 2018, including:
""It was a strong second quarter for Electronic Arts, with players around the world captivated by our new EA SPORTS titles, top-performing mobile games, and expanding esports competitions,"" CEO Andrew Wilson said. ""The digital transformation is accelerating across our industry, and we are well-positioned for continued growth with more stunning new titles, thriving event-driven live services including competitive gaming, and continuing innovation for our players on all platforms.""

            ","Right in time for the Halloween season, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has delivered news that has given some shareholders a fright. The publisher announced on Oct. 17 that it would be closing Visceral Games, a studio within the company that had been working on a big-budget Star Wars game. The title will be picked up by a new team but will undergo a substantial change in direction and is now likely years from release.
With the company's shares down roughly 4% following the news, it's worth taking a look at whether the closing of Visceral is merely a near-term setback or a potential indication of more serious problems at EA.
EA's Star Wars Battlefront II will still be launching this November, but one of the company's other in-development games based on the famous sci-fi series appears to be in trouble. Image source: Electronic Arts.
The closing of a video game studio is rarely cause for celebration so it makes sense that news of a faltering developer and project would be accompanied by a stock sell-off. At a basic level, the closure is an admission that something wasn't working within the Visceral team and that EA no longer saw the unit as a smart use of resources. This sort of thing is not uncommon in the industry.
Game development is expensive, and the studio had reportedly been working on the untitled Star Wars game for roughly three and a half years. Opting to shutter Visceral and dramatically rework the game is not a decision that was taken lightly, and it will be difficult to recoup production costs even if the title is completed and winds up being sales hit.
That said, shutting down a studio is not necessarily dire news for long-term investors. As with any business, there will be units that underperform. Having the flexibility to address these issues and reshuffle to better fit the needs of the overall company is a necessary part of operational success.
To put the closing of Visceral in perspective, it's worth taking a look at another high-profile studio shutdown from recent years.
Following the release of Take-Two Interactive's (NASDAQ:TTWO) Bioshock Infinite in 2014, the company opted to close down the title's developer, Irrational Games. This was a studio that was responsible for well-received titles that had sold millions of units but was still going over budget and creating a questionable value proposition for the company. Opting to shut down a studio that was responsible for some of its most critically acclaimed titles might have seemed like a worrying move at the time, but Take-Two's overall performance has only improved in subsequent years.
That's not to say that these two situations are perfectly analogous, but closing one development team and shifting much of its talent to other units probably isn't a big deal for a company of EA's size.
Visceral's Star Wars project was intended to be a story-focused adventure that would deliver cinematic gameplay set in the galaxy far, far away. By most accounts, the game was primarily a single-player experience -- a characteristic that would have put it out of step with today's best-performing titles.
With production budgets still increasing and in-game purchases emerging as one of the key elements to a game's success, maintaining long-term player engagement is becoming one of the most important goals for development teams. At present, it's easier to sustain player engagement, and in-game spending, with multiplayer content.
If you think of a video game as being similar to a sandbox, adding new multiplayer content is like adding a new accessory to the box that can be experienced by numerous users simultaneously. Creating single-player expansion content is like building an entirely new offshoot environment to play in, but it can only be used by one person at a time and is more expensive and less likely to increase total play time. Put simply, the economics of the video game market are not favorable to single-player focused experiences at the moment.
If Visceral's project wasn't coming together after more than three years in development, the decision to change the game's direction is probably a sensible one. EA has been a well-managed company under CEO Andrew Wilson, so shareholders can be reasonably confident that the company is making the right move disbanding the studio.
EA signed a 10-year deal with Disney (NYSE:DIS) for exclusive video game rights to the Star Wars franchise in 2013. If additional projects wind up running into production difficulties or underperform upon release, Disney might seek to find a new partner for the license when the deal expires. That's probably an unlikely outcome, however. EA's 2015 release Star Wars Battlefront sold more than 14 million copies, its sequel Battlefront II is expected to match or exceed that figure, and mobile release Galaxy of Heroes has been a solid performer.
So, while news of Visceral shutting down and a big change in direction for the studio's former title is a setback, it probably won't have a major long-term impact for shareholders. It's unfortunate that the Star Wars project didn't come together under Visceral, but investors should view the studio closure as a bump in the road on EA's long-term growth path and not a major sign of weakness in the broader business.

If the idea of video games becoming popular spectator events that rival leading professional sports leagues in terms of viewership seems like a pipe dream, it shouldn't. Competitive video games, or esports as they're often called, are already among the fastest-growing forms of entertainment today, and most signs suggest that the category's explosive popularity is just getting started. 
Image source: Tencent Holdings. 
Right now, the biggest title in esports is Riot Games and Tencent Holdings' (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY) League of Legends, which is putting up massive viewership numbers. Last year, 43 million people tuned in to the League of Legends championship, with peak concurrent viewers coming in at 14.7 million. To put that latter figure in perspective, peak concurrent viewers for the record-setting Game 7 of last year's NBA Finals were 44.5 million. That's an impressive comparison, considering that League of Legends viewership is still growing rapidly and production costs for its events are much lower than for traditional sports content.
Image source: Activision Blizzard.
Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Twitch reports that roughly half of millennial-aged American males watch video game content on its streaming platform. Although that figure includes noncompetitive broadcasts, millennial interest in professional gaming events is also quite high. According to Newzoo, a provider of esports market data, 22% of male millennials in the U.S. watch competitive esports -- putting the category on roughly equal footing with baseball and hockey for the demographic.
Image source: Getty Images.
According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the average view duration for an esports broadcast is 84 minutes. That's stellar audience retention given how competitive the digital-content space is, and it points to huge advertising opportunities. Even more promising, since most esports viewers are consuming content digitally, targeting should make ad delivery much more effective (and valuable) than it is for standard television-based broadcasts. 
Image source: Getty Images.
According to a report published by ad agency GMR, 43% of surveyed esports viewers indicated that they always appreciate when brands reach out through the gaming world -- and another 42% indicated that they usually appreciate brand marketing through gaming channels. Authenticity is important in advertising and even more so with the often-selective video game-playing audience. The fact that esports enthusiasts are receptive to marketing suggests big opportunities for brands and should help the category grow quickly.

Competitive players in Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) Madden and FIFA series are up to three times more engaged with the games' network than those who are not playing competitively, according to the company's CEO. With publishers increasingly relying on in-game purchases to drive fiscal performance, engagement is emerging as a metric that rivals unit sales in terms of importance. Featuring competitive leagues is a great way to keep users coming back to a title.
Like other sports championships, video game leagues will feature stratified skill levels, but the potential for monetizing non-elite competitions is much higher thanks to the global nature of online gaming and the fact that almost anyone can be a broadcaster.

Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) sold the rights to the first seven professional teams in its recently formed Overwatch league for $20 million each. Buyers included New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and New York Mets COO Jeff Wilpon. Here's Kraft explaining his company's decision to get into the competitive-gaming space:
We have been exploring the esports market for a number of years and have been waiting for the right opportunity to enter. The incredible global success of Overwatch since its launch, coupled with the league's meticulous focus on a structure and strategy that clearly represents the future of esports made this the obvious entry point for the Kraft Group.
The Overwatch league will generate revenue through advertising and ticket sales, and Activision plans to share 50% of league revenues with owners and teams. The publisher also expect to announce more teams for the league in the near future.

Newzoo projects that the esports industry will generate roughly $700 million in revenue this year and be worth $1.5 billion in 2020 -- good for an average annual growth rate of roughly 29%. It's also worth noting that Newzoo's figures do not include money made from esports-related gambling. With those revenue streams included, media and technology consulting firm Activate estimates that the esports market will be worth $5 billion in 2020.

            ","Video game maker Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) reports its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Oct. 31, right after market close, so you'll have plenty of time to get ready to hand out candy to scary little monsters and princesses.
The stock is up nearly 50% year to date, so investors will be very tuned in to what management has to say about performance of recent game releases, and its take on current trends impacting the company heading into the important holiday quarter.
Here's what investors need to know.

Management is calling for GAAP revenue to grow 6.3% year over year to $955 million. Operating expense will be up from the prior-year quarter due to investments in marketing, new games, and the development of live services. This is expected to result in a loss per share of $0.18 on a GAAP basis, worse than last year's loss of $0.13.
In the short term, the stock price will likely fluctuate based on whether the game maker meets or beats consensus analyst predictions of $1.18 billion in non-GAAP revenue and $0.54 in non-GAAP earnings per share.
EA released new versions of its two most popular sports titles during the quarter -- Madden NFL 18 and FIFA 18, both of which received good reviews overall. Rounding up the new-game releases for the quarter were NBA Live 18 and NHL 18. Keep in mind that the fiscal second quarter is expected to make up only 23% of non-GAAP revenue for 2018. A much more significant 39% chunk should come during the holiday quarter.
So far, recent and upcoming releases have generated twice as much interest on social media as last year's game slate, according to the company. Star Wars: Battlefront II will be the headline title for the holiday quarter and is expected to drive strong sales. Other fiscal third-quarter releases include a console version of The Sims 4 and Need for Speed: Payback -- two of the best-selling franchises in the industry.
Investors should listen for any updates from management about these upcoming releases, as they will be important to how well EA performs through the end of fiscal 2018.
Investors will also want to hear about EA's digital revenue. The growth of digital revenue has been driving higher margins and cash from operating activities. For the trailing-12-month period, digital revenue is up 23% and makes up 63% of total revenue. Since digitally delivered content costs less to produce than physical game discs, gross margin reached a company record of 73.2% in fiscal 2017 (ended in March), and management expects it to climb further to 74.9% for fiscal 2018.
The biggest contributor to digital revenue growth is live services, which grew 22% in the fiscal first quarter to $420 million. Live services growth has been driven by Madden and FIFA's Ultimate Team digital card game, as well as Battlefield 1's in-game content offerings.
Another important driver of digital revenue growth is the trend of players buying more games directly over their console or PC, instead of buying physical copies at retailers. Trailing-12-month digital sales of games (or full-game downloads) grew 50% to $751 million. About 34% of EA's unit game sales were digital through the first quarter, up from 27% a year ago.
The convenience of buying games directly over console will likely push gamers further down this path, which will only help EA's gross margin expand more.
Overall, investors should listen closely to how well Madden NFL 18 and FIFA 18 are performing, since Ultimate Team alone generated $832 million in revenue in fiscal 2017, and the titles are important contributors to EA's digital revenue growth.
And when management gives its updates for the holiday quarter, focus on how engaged players are with its current game roster heading into the third quarter, and on any word on live service offerings for new games.

            ","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...
Stocks (as a whole) have rarely been as expensive as they are today. The data confirms it.
Currently, stocks on the S&P 500 average a valuation of 25 times trailing earnings. A dispassionate look at the data shows that since the index was established in 1923, there have been only three other periods in which stocks on the S&P 500 equaled or exceeded this value.
That news in and of itself may make you nervous, but here's something else you should know: Within the S&P 500, there are sectors that cost even more. Gaming software, for instance.
Buckingham is having a blast recommending video gaming stocks today. Image source: Getty Images.
Financial data aggregator finviz.com confirms that each of the three highest-profile video gaming companies in the U.S. -- Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) -- score P/E ratios of roughly 32 times earnings, 44 times earnings, and 68 times earnings, respectively. And yet, despite these high prices, Electronic Arts, Activision, and Take-Two are the three stocks that NYC-based equity researcher Buckingham Research decided to initiate coverage on today -- all with buy ratings.
Why are gaming stocks so much more expensive than the already expensive stocks found elsewhere on the S&P 500? Well, investors (and analysts) expect a lot more growth out of these companies than they expect the average S&P 500 stock to produce.
Morningstar data, for example, suggest that on average, analysts expect earnings on the S&P 500 to grow at about 9.8% annually over the next five years. Gaming stocks, on the other hand, are expected to grow much, much faster.
On finviz, the cheapest of the big video gamers, Electronic Arts, is pegged for a long-term growth rate in excess of 15% -- 50% faster than the average S&P 500 stock. Activision and Take-Two meanwhile, are expected to grow their earnings at the even faster rates of 21% and 20%, respectively -- roughly twice as fast as the average S&P 500 stock.
Hence, the higher prices investors are willing to pay for them.
So what lies behind all this optimism about growth in gaming, and is it justified? Our friends at TheFly.com were kind enough to share details on Buckingham's three upgrades today. As they report, the main thesis behind Buckingham's three-pronged endorsement of EA, Activision, and Take-Two is the analyst's belief that a ""shift to digital distribution and in-game content delivery"" is underway in the gaming world.
These trends will be ""game changers for the video game publishers,"" says Buckingham. Releasing publishers from their reliance on third-party distributors to sell their wares, Buckingham believes, will yield both ""better revenue predictability and higher margins"" for publishers like EA. As these trends bear fruit, Buckingham predicts we will see management at all three companies continue to raise guidance for sales and earnings, leading to ""multiple expansion,"" and even higher P/E ratios for EA and its peers.
Among these peers by the way, Buckingham says that Activision Blizzard ""is the best managed and best positioned company within the video game sector to benefit from"" these trends. Accordingly, Buckingham is assigning a $79 price target to Activision stock, which implies 23% upside for new investors.
Electronic Arts gets a $143 price target -- 19% upside.
And Take-Two takes third place in Buckingham's review of the gaming industry. Its $120 price target implies Take-Two shares will rise 17% over the next 12 months.
So...does all this mean you should rush right out and buy shares of Electronic Arts stock, and Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive as well?
Maybe, but also maybe not. From a pure PEG perspective, I have to say that buying Electronic Arts at 32 times earnings, with a 15% projected growth rate, doesn't look like a particularly attractive value proposition. Likewise Activision stock at 44 times earnings and 21% growth, and (especially) Take-Two at 68 times earnings and only 20% growth.
On the other hand though, it's worth pointing out that all three of these companies generate significantly greater free cash flow from their businesses than their income statements reflect. Electronic Arts' $1.6 billion in free cash flow generated over the past year dwarf the company's $1.2 billion in reported net income, for example. Likewise Activision's $1.9 billion in free cash flow (versus $1.1 billion in earnings). Take-Two is almost literally twice as profitable on a cash basis (free cash flow of $301 million) as it appears under GAAP (reported earnings of $166 million).
None of the three stocks meets my criteria for becoming a deep value investment just yet. But they're getting close.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) just completed a record year for revenue, margins, and profit, driven by strong player engagement in its top sports titles -- FIFA 17 and Madden NFL 17. The stock is up 50% year to date, which follows an impressive almost 800% run over the last five years.
For fiscal 2018 ending in March, management has guided for another year of record revenue, as well as further expansion in gross margin from the growth in digital revenue. Digital revenue was 59% of total revenue last year and is expected to grow about 15% in fiscal 2018. Management is calling for gross margin to reach 74.9% as a result. Let's take a look at what is in store for key game releases in the next year to deliver these results.
Image source: easports.com
EA's FIFA soccer title is one of the company's best-selling games. In fiscal 2017, it represented 11% of total revenue. The big draw for FIFA players is Ultimate Team -- a virtual card game where players can unlock real-world soccer stars to create fantasy teams to compete with other players online. Ultimate Team alone totaled 16% of EA's annual revenue last year and should continue to grow as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future.
The FIFA Ultimate Team player base grew 13% in fiscal 2017 and another 11% through the fiscal first quarter of 2018. The great thing about this in-game feature is that it's addictive, fun, and enhances the gaming experience. The more money players spend buying card packs, the more fun the game becomes. It's a powerful, enormously profitable feature that is essentially printing money for EA since the cost of producing virtual (or digital) in-game cards is basically nothing compared to making the game itself.
The next installment in the series -- FIFA 18 -- releases in September, and this year's version may outsell last year's version. FIFA 18 is looking at a World Cup year next year, which should help grow the audience for the game as marketing and buzz around soccer will likely create greater interest from gamers.
Madden NFL 18 was just released in August and is the first Madden developed with the new Frostbite gameplay engine -- the same used in FIFA -- which generates realistic player animations and an authentic feel of playing through a real sporting event. The new Madden looks to duplicate the success of FIFA 17's popular story mode feature -- called The Journey -- which helped drive strong sales of FIFA 17 last year. Madden 18 has already received good reviews for its new Longshot story mode and should help the football franchise bring in new gamers.
Another element working in EA's favor with the new Madden is esports. EA and the NFL recently announced the new Madden NFL Club Championship. It creates the third Madden esports tournament as part of what's called the EA Majors, where the best Madden players will compete to win a $1.15 million cash purse.
What's interesting here is that Ultimate Team serves as the gateway to esports for EA's sports franchises, so as interest grows in Madden and FIFA esports tournaments, it helps fuel growth in Ultimate Team revenue.
Earlier in the year, management hinted at a new franchise in the works that is a fresh new concept, with a new story set in a unique universe. It is planned for launch sometime in fiscal 2019. The new game sounds like a science-fiction style game similar to Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) largely successful Destiny franchise. The new franchise from EA will include additional in-game revenue opportunities from post-launch digital content, which means this game will be one more title EA has in its arsenal to grow digital revenue and margins.
Another big release on the horizon is Star Wars: Battlefront 2, which promises to be a big hit this holiday. It will feature a single-player story mode, which last year's version lacked -- something that gamers were disappointed about. Just the inclusion of a new single-player experience should help Battlefront 2 sell more copies compared to last year's Battlefront game.
But that's not all. Ultimate Team has been so successful for EA's sports franchises that management is bridging the massively popular Star Wars universe with in-game ""Star Cards,"" which will be similar to Ultimate Team for FIFA and Madden.
All together, the company is looking at another record year in fiscal 2018. Whether or not it's enough to push the stock higher after its phenomenal run is a topic for another day. For now, shareholders should be encouraged that EA is not resting on its laurels, but is pushing the throttle forward for more growth.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has been riding momentum in the broader video-game industry and benefiting from efforts to improve the quality of its output that kicked off under CEO Andrew Wilson in 2013. Shares are up more than 740% over the past five years, thanks to a string of impressive earnings performances and the promising outlook for the business. Here's a look at some of the key earnings figures from last quarter:
Read on for three key quotes from the company's most recent earnings presentation and a deeper look at what's been driving the publisher's incredible success.
Image source: Electronic Arts.
Much to the chagrin of retail outlets such as GameStop, video-game fans are increasingly buying titles direct from publishers as digital downloads. This shift not only allows Electronic Arts to keep a cut of sales that would otherwise go to retailers, but it also eliminates expenses related to manufacturing and shipping physical copies of games -- leading to substantially better margins on each unit sold.
Thirty-four percent of the company's game sales on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One came from digital channels in its June-ended quarter -- up from 27% in the prior-year period. Looking ahead, the company expects that 40% of its unit sales will come from digital by the end of the year and that this share can climb above 60% in the not-too-distant future. Here's Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen discussing consumer receptivity and explaining the biggest challenges to getting digital sales to the next level:
While there's high-bandwidth speeds in the United States and in key major countries like the U.K. or France or Germany, that's not consistent all through Europe or Eastern Europe or Asia. And so that's probably still the biggest impediment to full game downloads. And the second piece is, while we in the U.S. and I think it's the same in Northern Europe and in some parts of Europe, the cashless credit or cashless transaction methods are fairly well developed. I would say they're not as well developed in other places in the world. So the use of credit cards, PayPal, any type of e-pay approach has still got a long way to go.
And I would say those two things are the biggest impediments to full game downloads. We know that the consumer, once they do a full game download, realizes how easy it is and how effective it is for managing their games. And so we don't see consumer resistance.
Last year saw roughly 10% of retail game sales migrate to digital, and EA's download-based sales should only increase as the global games market expands, high-speed internet access becomes more available, and online payments gain ground. 
Software sales in the video-game industry have historically been front-loaded, with a title's first month in release being by far its most important sales period. While having a strong debut is still very important to a title's success, rapid growth for in-game purchases over the past five years has made keeping players engaged past the initial sale crucial to overall performance. Here's EA CEO Andrew Wilson breaking down some of the company's recent wins on the engagement front:
Ultimate Team grew 11% year over year through Q1. In our mobile businesses, FIFA Mobile expanded to more than 95 million unique players, and NBA Live Mobile grew to more than 70 million unique players. Our Sims community continues to be strong: Monthly active players in The Sims 4 increased more than 20% year over year in Q1, and we're excited to have a new Sims mobile game in soft launch. And in Battlefield 1, our community has grown to 21 million unique players experiencing an extensive live service, with monthly updates, in-game events and missions, and the largest expansion packs in franchise history.
Ultimate Team -- a card-game mode that the company includes with its sports games and is branching to other franchises, including Star Wars Battlefront -- generated roughly $800 million in sales last fiscal year and is a good microcosm for the benefits that big publishers such as Electronic Arts are reaping from digital-content sales. Like other downloadable expansions, creating Ultimate Team content is substantially less costly than developing entirely new, large-scale games, and the popularity of these products is having a tremendous impact on EA's profitability. By improving player engagement through improved quality of product, in-game special events, and other measures, the company has ongoing opportunities to grow these high-margin digital content sales.
Electronic Arts has been making considerable strides in improving its development cycles, and these advancements are translating to improved top- and bottom-line performance. Here, Wilson outlines some of the ways the company has been getting better at creating games:
EA's investments in engine technology, analytics, infrastructure, and research continue to fuel advancements in our games, our services, and our player network. Our industry-leading Frostbite engine is now powering development of a dozen new titles across our portfolio. It is continually engineered alongside our world-class technology platform for games and services, enabling our creative teams to leverage sophisticated data and insights to conceptualize and build the most incredible new experiences for our players.
Having a versatile development engine like Frostbite helps to speed development and keep costs down. To use an analogy, having to create a new engine for each game is kind of like constructing a building and having to fashion your own bricks and other materials, while having an engine to work with is like having many of the important elements pre-fashioned. EA has been seeing similar benefits from having a shared digital platform for its games that streamlines features including multiplayer and delivering updates for its titles -- creating a holistic development structure that should help the company continue to deliver impressive results.

            ","Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) Ultimate Team EA Sports branded games -- FIFA and Madden NFL -- are making tons of money for the game maker to the tune of $832 million in the fiscal year 2017. The problem EA management is trying to solve is how they can grow Ultimate Team revenue even more. One answer has been esports, in which Ultimate Team serves as the gateway to competitive gaming for EA's sports franchises. And EA just found a powerful new partner to up the ante for its Madden Championship Series esports tournament.
The Madden Championship Series is an esports tournament for EA's top selling Madden NFL franchise. The series is comprised of two events that make up what's called the EA Majors -- Madden Classic and Madden Challenge. Now, EA and the NFL are teaming up to create a new competitive gaming tournament that will be the third event in the EA Majors called Madden NFL Club Championship.
Image source: Electronic Arts.
EA launched esports tournaments for both FIFA and Madden NFL for the first time in the fiscal year 2017. More than 10 million players participated last year across both sports titles for a chance to win a piece of a big cash prize. This year's Madden Championship is awarding $1.153 million to the finalists of the three EA Majors.
The Madden NFL Club Championship event is unique in that all 32 NFL teams are participating, with each qualifying Madden player representing one of 32 NFL teams in the Live Finals. The finals will start at the Pro Bowl in Orlando, with the championship match held at the Super Bowl Experience Driven by GMC in Minneapolis. It's the largest ever commitment by a traditional professional sports league in esports.
The announcement of the Madden Club Championship coincides with the release of Madden NFL 18 -- the officially licensed football game of the NFL. The EA and NFL partnership follows a similar one announced earlier in the year between the NBA and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) to create the NBA 2K eLeague -- a professional esports league based on Take-Two's top selling NBA 2K franchise -- the officially licensed basketball game of the NBA.
Esports -- which is turning competitive gaming into a spectator sport -- has a huge fan base numbering more than 300 million and is growing fast. According to Newzoo, esports revenue is expected to grow about 35% per year through 2020 and reach $1.5 billion. This amount is mainly comprised of brand investment for advertising, sponsorship, and media rights. The appeal for big brands is the demographic that esports attracts -- millennials, a coveted audience for big brands, including traditional sports leagues like the NFL.
Lately, NFL and NBA team owners have been getting more involved in video games by investing in esports. Most notably, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft's recent purchase of an esports team in Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) Overwatch League. It's basically a way for sports team owners to stretch their horizons and diversify revenue streams, as well as meet millennials where they are spending more of their time.
In the announcement with EA, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had this to say:
Competitive gaming and esports are one of the most exciting ways to engage a larger, younger and digitally savvy NFL audience. Collaborating with EA to create the Madden NFL Club Championship presents a unique opportunity to capture the excitement of NFL action and the passion of our fans with competition that anyone can participate in.
EA has designed the online competitive gaming mode in its sports titles -- FIFA and Madden NFL -- to go through the Ultimate Team virtual card game. In Ultimate Team, Madden players can purchase in-game card packs that unlock real life NFL stars that gamers use to build their fantasy football team, which is then used in online competitive games with other players. It's highly addicting and helps EA build very high engagement with the player base because it taps the competitive nature of gamers who want to win. A $1.1 million cash purse can certainly help, as well.
EA generated 17% of its total revenue last year from Ultimate Team alone, so you can start to see the rationale here. An officially sponsored esports event with the NFL, with a huge cash prize dangling in front of Madden players, is a great way to encourage higher engagement among the player base and grow revenue from in-game spending within Ultimate Team.

            ","Both Ubisoft (NASDAQOTH:UBSFF) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) have generated huge returns for shareholders over the last five years, as both have been expanding margins from the growing demand for digitally delivered in-game content.
We're going to take a look at the basic investment case for each to find out which one is the better buy.
Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Origins is the next installment in the series due for release in fall 2017. Image source: Ubisoft
Ubisoft is headquartered in Paris, France, and is home to the popular Tom Clancy shooters, in addition to Watch Dogs, Far Cry, and Assassin's Creed.
The online multiplayer game modes of the Tom Clancy series have been a key driver of Ubisoft's recurrent in-game revenue in the new age of digital distribution of video game content. Over the last five years, Ubisoft's digital revenue as a percentage of total revenue has increased from 11.7% to 50%, and it's expected to keep growing.
With more revenue coming from digitally delivered content, Ubisoft has been able to generate a greater amount of profit based on cash flows in the last four years (excluding fiscal 2016).
Data source: Earnings press releases. Figures based on current exchange rate. Dollar amounts in millions.
Ubisoft mainly caters to console and PC gamers and has been somewhat late to the party in pursuing the profitable growth of mobile games. The Paris-based company finally took the plunge over the last year with two acquisitions -- Ketchapp and Growtopia. But it's just a splash since mobile and other revenue made up only 7% of Ubisoft's total revenue in fiscal 2017 ending in March.
Similar to Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft has been getting interested in movies and consumer products. In December 2016, a movie adaptation was released based on one of the biggest franchises in gaming -- Assassin's Creed -- but it grossed only $55 million at the box office, with an estimated budget of $125 million, according to Box Office Mojo. However, the movie was a success in management's perspective, causing a 30% increase in sales of the Assassin's Creed game around the time of the movie release. And that's really the whole point with these non-gaming initiatives like movies and consumer products -- to stir up brand awareness around best-selling game franchises.

Through its EA Sports label, the California-based game maker produces two of the top selling sports franchises in gaming -- FIFA and Madden NFL. EA also licenses the Star Wars brand with its Star Wars: Battlefront series. Other major franchises include Battlefield, The Sims, Need for Speed, and the popular mobile game Plants vs. Zombies.
Data source: Earnings release presentations. Dollar amounts in millions.
While Ubisoft has been playing catch up with mobile games, EA was primed and ready for the new digital age of gaming seven years ago when it had 48 mobile games available around the time the iPad launched. In fiscal 2017, EA generated about 13% of its revenue from mobile games, about twice the percentage of Ubisoft. Altogether, digital revenue comprises 63% of EA's annual revenue.
As gamers buy more content digitally, EA has seen its gross margin expand from 63% to 73.2% over the last five years. As you can see in the table above, profits based on cash flow have exploded as a result.
The Ultimate Team virtual card game has been an important contributor to EA's digital revenue growth in recent years. Ultimate Team for FIFA and Madden made up 17% of EA's total revenue last year, and this percentage will likely grow over time. 
Ultimate Team has been so successful that management is currently planning a similar feature in the upcoming Star Wars: Battlefront 2 later this year. It's likely only a matter of time before there is an Ultimate Team style feature in EA's first-person shooter Battlefield as well.
Ubisoft's price-to-free cash flow ratio is about 70 based on fiscal 2017 numbers. The figure has been elevated by the expectations for strong growth over the next few years, as promised by Ubisoft management. Management expects revenue to reach $2.5 billion, which is anticipated to result in $357 million in free cash flow based on today's currency exchange rate. 
On the other hand, EA is expecting cash flow to be flat in fiscal 2018 and the stock currently trades at 29 times fiscal 2017 free cash flow. Which makes it a cheaper stock compared to Ubisoft, but with slower growth expectations.
However, EA has a much stronger balance sheet with $4.5 billion in cash and short-term securities, with only $990 million in debt. That's a net cash position of $3.5 billion. On the other hand, Ubisoft has a net debt position of about $96 million, which tilts the advantage to EA. 
Since EA trades at a much lower valuation based on current cash flow generation, and since we're taking a leap of faith that Ubisoft will meet its guidance looking out two years, EA seems like the safer bet at this time making it the better buy, in my opinion.

            ","The video game industry's shift to a digital distribution strategy is not only helping game companies expand margins, but it is also helping companies generate revenue more consistently throughout the year instead of relying on holiday shoppers in December.
In a previous article, I examined the progress Activision Blizzard has made to generate year-round revenue. Now, let's examine the seasonality of Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) financial results over the last seven years.
Image source: Getty Images.
Up through the fiscal year ending in March 2010, the most important quarter of the year for Electronic Arts was the fiscal third quarter ending in December. EA generated 34% of its annual revenue in that quarter in FY 2010. In fiscal 2010, EA had just started to lay the foundation for the industry shift to digital distribution, which was about to take off. That year, digital revenue -- including full game downloads, extra in-game content, mobile games, subscriptions, and ads -- totaled only 16% of EA's annual revenue. But as digital revenue climbed over the last seven years, the amount of annual revenue generated in the holiday quarter (Q3) dropped to 24%, making EA less dependent on holiday shoppers.
Dollar amounts in millions. These are fiscal years; EA's fiscal year ends at the end of March. Data sources: Earnings presentations, 10-K, and 10-Q SEC filings.  
EA management recognized the shift to digital distribution early and was already well-positioned heading into calendar year 2010 with 48 mobile games available -- more than the total number of console games EA developed for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 combined. In fiscal 2012, other digital revenue categories -- including extra content for console/PC games -- were starting to contribute in a big way. This led to EA being less reliant on holiday quarter sales, as extra content spending helped EA generate more revenue over the summer months, which is a slow period for new game releases.
Dollar amounts in millions. These are fiscal years; EA's fiscal year ends at the end of March.  Data source: Company earnings presentations. 
The growth of extra content revenue shows how the business of making video games has changed. No longer do game companies produce a game, sell it for $60, and that's it. Today, game companies sell a game, and that's just the beginning of the revenue opportunity. For example, EA offers an in-game feature for FIFA and Madden NFL called Ultimate Team, where players can purchase in-game virtual card packs that unlock real life sports stars that players use to build their dream team. These fantasy teams can then be taken online to compete with other players.
Ultimate Team is a fast-growing business for EA. The feature was first introduced in FIFA 09 in 2008 and had over 1 million users generating $8 million in digital revenue. In fiscal 2017, Ultimate Team across FIFA and Madden NFL generated 17% of EA's total revenue. Ultimate Team has been so popular with its sports titles that EA management is evaluating how the feature could apply to other non-sports games, potentially the popular first-person shooter Battlefield. EA is already planning a similar Ultimate Team-style mode for Star Wars: Battlefront 2 releasing this fall.
As digital revenue has grown, EA's profit margins have exploded, as you can see in the following table. 
Dollar amounts in millions. These are fiscal years; EA's fiscal year ends at the end of March. Data sources: Fiscal 2017 data from earnings press release. Fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2010 data from S&P Capital IQ.  
Sales of digital content cost EA relatively little to produce compared to the cost of creating games, which is a reason why margins have expanded so much in the last few years. Margins will continue to expand, as full game downloads only make up about a third of EA's annual sales, and management expects more gamers to continue migrating to this method of purchasing games. Also, management is just beginning to pursue the opportunity to spread the Ultimate Team feature to its non-sports titles, such as Star Wars: Battlefront and potentially Battlefield. 
EA has become less dependent on holiday shoppers over the last seven years as a result of year-round revenue opportunities from digital sources. This gives management greater visibility for year to year revenue and net income, which provides greater flexibility with planning future projects, as well as providing the company more cash to invest in new franchises, and potentially acquisitions, share repurchases, and/or dividends.

            ","Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) recently delivered its first profitable quarter in nearly five years, and shares of the company are up roughly 40% year-to-date. After trying to find its footing in the mobile market for years, the market appears to have new faith in the company under the management of CEO Frank Gibeau -- who became the company's top executive in 2016 after previously heading up the mobile unit at Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).
In addition to returning to profitability, last quarter saw the company deliver its best sales in five years, with mobile games delivering a record 86% sales contribution. The table below illustrates some of the other progress that the company has made in mobile by comparing its recently delivered second-quarter results to the prior-year period:
Data source: Zynga.
Zynga's recent focus on boosting monetization from its existing properties is making for good short-term results and has fueled the stock's recent rally, but long-term the company still has some major issues to overcome. 
Mobile strategy game Dawn of Titans hasn't been the success that Zynga would have liked; Image source: Zynga.
Under Gibeau's direction, Zynga is working on delivering content updates for franchises including Zynga Poker, Words With Friends, and CSR Racing in order to extend their product life cycles. Keeping players engaged with these franchises is a promising way to generate high-margin sales without the risky development expenses associated with creating new titles, but, eventually, the company will need to introduce new hit franchises.
While Zynga has had considerable success using the data at its disposal to drive monetization for its core properties, the company has a poor track record when it comes to internally developing new hit properties. The company's most recent quarterly report showed strong results for CSR Racing 2, but even CSR Racing was the result of the company's $527 million acquisition of NaturalMotion -- a deal that looks pricey even given the racing game's recent success.
Even proven concepts have come up short for Zynga recently. Here's a quote from the company's most recent earnings call when asked why deferred revenues came in below expectations:
As it relates to Q2, when we were setting our guidance, the expectation is we would see a -- even though there were small, more of a contribution from our new releases, Crosswords and Boggle, those delivered less than we expected, so that obviously played into the build of deferred revenue as you normally expect that from your newer games.
Dawn of Titans, another game from Zynga's NaturalMotion studio, spent roughly five years in a trial release phase before finally getting an official release at the end of 2016, but, it seems unlikely that it will have much staying power based on the game's performance on the App Store charts. Launching new titles in the crowded mobile market is challenging, but, even so, Zynga's track record is not encouraging.  
Zynga's disadvantages compared to other major video game companies aren't limited to developing new intellectual properties. Not only has the company had difficulty creating new hit games, but its existing core franchises are significantly less potent than those driving the leaders in the increasingly competitive mobile space.
Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) King Digital wing successfully parlayed its Candy Crush Saga success into a spinoff hit with Candy Crush Soda Saga, and the two titles have now both placed in the top-10 of U.S. mobile app stores for 15 consecutive quarters. Similarly, Tencent Holding's Supercell mobile development wing has followed 2012-release Clash of Clans up with Clash Royale in early 2016 and both games continue to rank in the top-10 grossing games on Apple's App Store.
Like Activision and other traditionally console-oriented games publishers, Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) is now more actively pursuing game development on smartphones and tablets and has branched its massively popular Pokemon franchise into the mobile sphere with Pokemon Go -- which recently saw its biggest day of player spending since the game's July 2016 launch. 
Nintendo and Activision Blizzard have a wealth of viable franchises that could, and will, make the transition to mobile, and each company also has a great track record of coming up with successful new video game properties. Meanwhile, Electronic Arts has big brands including FIFA, Star Wars, and Battlefield to leverage in the space, and all of these companies have substantial development and marketing advantages compared to Zynga.
Outside of CSR Racing and titles in the slots category, the core games behind most of Zynga's major revenue drivers are roughly a decade old. It's a credit to the company that titles like Zynga Poker and Words With Friends have had such staying power (though sales for Words were down 17% year-over-year last quarter), but Zynga faces big risks if it can't improve its ability to create new hits over the next decade.

            ","Shares of Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) jumped 10.4% in July, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after earnings and increasing expectations for the gaming industry pushed shares higher. 
Earnings weren't released until late in the month, but anticipation was high heading into the quarter, particularly as new titles like FIFA 18 and Madden NFL 18 are prepped for store shelves. Fiscal first-quarter revenue rose 14% to $1.45 billion, and operating income was up 33% to $743 million despite the lack of hit new games in the quarter.

Digital revenues, which are more consistent and higher margin than game sales in stores, were 63% of trailing-12-month sales and up 23% over that time. With FIFA Mobile now at 95 million users and games like NBA LIVE Mobile moving to live platforms, there will be growing ways to monetize live user experiences. And that will continue to drive financials if EA can keep making hit games. 
Video games continue to be a hot business, and as EA transitions to more digital sales from mobile devices or expansion packs, it will make more money and be less reliant on each game being a big hit right out of the gate. It can incrementally improve and find ways to monetize content as users adopt a game, as it has done with live sports games. The fiscal first quarter was another step in the right direction, and with big game releases coming in the fiscal second and third quarters, EA's stock could just be heating up for the year.

Data source: Electronic Arts Q1 2018 earnings release.
Total net revenue rose 14% year over year to $1.4 billion, fueled by a 28% jump in digital revenue.
Notably, live services net sales leapt 22% to $420 million, driven by the strong performance of FIFA Ultimate Team, Battlefield 1, and The Sims 4. Mobile net sales rose 6% to $150 million, primarily because of the growth of FIFA Mobile, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and NBA Mobile. And full-game PC and console downloads generated net sales of $111 million -- a 32% increase -- mainly because of robust sales of Mass Effect: Andromeda.

This robust digital sales growth furthered Electronic Arts' shift toward digital distribution, as 61% of its first-quarter total net revenue came from digital game sales, compared with 54% in Q1 2017. That helped gross margin improve to 89.4% from 85.9% in the year-ago period. In turn, gross profit increased 19% to $1.3 billion. And with operating expenses increasing only 4%, operating income surged 33% to $743 million. All told, net income soared 46% year over year to $644 million, or $2.06 per share.
Moreover, Electronic Arts' heightened profitability helped bolster its cash production, with Q1 operating cash flow rising to a record $176 million. ""Our operating cash flow was the highest ever for a first quarter and underlines how live services have fundamentally transformed our business model,"" CFO Blake Jorgensen said in a press release. ""Driven by innovation and live services, we expect to continue to grow our profitability and cash generation.""
For the second quarter, Electronic Arts anticipates net revenue of approximately $955 million. The company also expects to generate a net loss of $57 million, or $0.18 per share.
EA also reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2018, including:
""Q1 was an outstanding quarter, with thriving player communities in our top franchises like Battlefield, our EA Sports portfolio, Star Wars, and The Sims continuing to grow our network and drive our digital business,"" added CEO Andrew Wilson. ""We have built strong momentum, and now we are accelerating into a year of tremendous innovation, where extraordinary new games, content-rich live services, and expanding global competitions will deliver more fun for our players and fuel growth for Electronic Arts.""

            ","Bull markets in stocks can last a lot longer than investors would ever imagine, and at eight years and counting, the current favorable period for the market has created a lot of winning companies. Gains for the broader market have been steady and consistent, but some individual stocks have launched much steeper climbs to much better performance. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), CoreSite Realty (NYSE:COR), and Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN) have all tripled in value in just three years, and investors looking at the three success stories want to know if there's more money to be made in the shares. Here, you'll learn more about these stocks and what lies ahead for the companies.

EA data by YCharts.
The video game industry has changed a lot over the years, but players still want top games they can enjoy. Electronic Arts has delivered on that front, with powerful franchises such as its Battlefield and FIFA series. Like many of its peers, EA has thrived when new gaming consoles become available, taking advantage of greater capabilities to show off its creative vision. Yet to an increasing extent, Electronic Arts has made the transition to mobile gaming, and that has increased the amount of digital revenue it can collect on a regular basis to make its financial results smoother and less lumpy from big game releases.
Even after such a solid run, Electronic Arts could have further to climb. Televised sports video gaming has started to take off as content providers seek ways to connect with younger audiences, and that could boost the popularity of EA's Madden football franchise along with its extensive lineup in other sports. Electronic Arts has also done a good job of increasing its profit margin by taking advantage of lower-cost digital distribution over physical game sales, cutting out retail intermediaries and keeping more for itself. With business and creative success, EA is still in good position to keep winning for shareholders in the future.

Most real estate investment trusts invest in things like office buildings or retail shopping malls, but recently, real estate investors have gotten an opportunity to move into the high-tech world. Data-center REITs such as CoreSite Realty have tapped into demand for cloud computing assets by focusing on the locations at which massive data storage centers operate to meet the information technology needs of their users.
CoreSite in particular is relatively small, with fewer than two dozen operational centers in eight different markets within the U.S., but it already has relationships with major players in the technology industry to provide for their data center real estate needs. CoreSite also expects to accelerate its growth in the future, and based solely on its current pipeline of expansion, the REIT hopes to boost its available square footage by nearly half in the coming years. CoreSite shareholders can collect an impressive dividend yield of 3.4% in addition to their share-price appreciation, and that makes the real estate investment trust an interesting play on the future of technology.
Finally, Align Technology has done an excellent job of meeting the need for orthodontic services. With its Invisalign clear tooth alignment devices, Align has challenged traditional braces successfully, and customers haven't hesitated to use the alternative to metal brackets in choosing between treatment options.
Align shows few signs of slowing down. In its most recent quarter, the company reported a record number of shipments, climbing to 208,000 cases. International volume now makes up almost two-fifths of Align's overall business, and the company can also boast greater utilization across the orthodontic industry. With expectations for demand to keep rising, Align Technology just needs to keep successfully executing on its current opportunities to sustain its recent success.
Few stocks triple in just three years, but these stocks have what it takes to create that kind of growth. Given their favorable prospects for the immediate future, further gains are quite possible for shareholders in these three stocks despite their impressive past run.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) will report its fiscal first-quarter earnings on July 27, and the keys to a good quarter will be the performance of key games, particularly FIFA 17 and Battlefield 1, as well as growth in live services such as Ultimate Team. 
For fiscal 2017 ending in March, EA expanded gross margin to 73.2% as more gamers continued to purchase content digitally instead of buying game discs. Management expects gross margin to reach 74.9% in fiscal 2018 with packaged goods revenue expected to decline 10% year over year, while sales of full game downloads are expected to grow 10% to 15%.

Additionally, EA has been centering its game portfolio around ""live services"" -- online game modes that the company updates with new content to keep players connected and engaged. This reduces EA's dependence on new game sales as players find additional content that increases the replay value of a certain game. As management continues to focus on its live service offerings, watch for digital revenue as a percentage of total net revenue to expand beyond its current 65% level, expanding margins in the process.
FIFA 17 has been one of the most popular sports titles with more than 21 million players joining the game in fiscal 2017. FIFA's Ultimate Team virtual card game has been very popular with players and should be a key contributor to digital revenue performance for the quarter. The FIFA Ultimate Team player base grew 13% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, and net sales specifically from the virtual card game increased 23%.
Also, Battlefield 1 has been showing strong growth and should be another key game to watch. Through the end of fiscal 2017, more than 19 million players joined Battlefield 1, which represents a 50% increase over the previous installment in the series.
Finally, this will be the first full quarter since the March release of Mass Effect: Andromeda, which was highly anticipated but got off to a rocky start after reports of several glitches in the game. The original Mass Effect trilogy was very popular and received great reviews. Andromeda, not so much. EA has been slowly rolling out software updates to fix the issues affecting Andromeda, so it will be interesting to see how well this game has sold. 
Other than games, investors should listen for any updates on the conference call with respect to EA's plans for esports, which is emerging as a significant long-term growth opportunity for video game companies. During the fiscal fourth quarter conference call, CEO Andrew Wilson said, ""competitive gaming and esports will be a key growth vector for us throughout fiscal 2018 as we expand the ways that fans can play and watch.""
Ultimate Team serves as the ""gateway"" to esports for FIFA and Madden NFL, with FIFA 17 typically among the top 25 or so games viewed on Twitch.tv, where gamers spectate other gamers. Later this year, EA will kick off two championships for FIFA and Madden, and also launch the first Battlefield 1 competition. EA is lining up broadcast partnerships with major networks including ESPN and Univision, which should help grow the audience for these games.
For the fiscal first quarter, management is calling for non-GAAP net revenue to grow 10% year over year to $750 million. However, whether it meets analysts' estimates will likely have a bigger impact on the short-term direction of the stock price. Analysts are predicting non-GAAP net revenue to be $768 million, with earnings per share estimated to be $0.27.
Although analyst estimates are useful for serving as a heads-up for what to expect, we don't want to be suckered into Wall Street's game of selling or buying EA stock based on whether it misses or beats expectations. What's far more important for Foolish investors is how EA is positioned for long-term growth based on its progress toward building its digital platform of live services across console, PC, and mobile, in addition to how its positioned for emerging growth opportunities like esports.

            ","An investment in either Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) or Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) would have yielded tremendous returns over the last five years, and each stock now trades in the neighborhood of lifetime highs. With both companies benefiting from the growth of high-margin digital sales and indications that the video game industry will continue to post solid growth over the long term, it's possible that each publisher will continue to thrive and deliver wins for their shareholders, but it's still worth diving into which looks like the better buy.
Knowing for certain which stock will perform better down the stretch is impossible, but a comparison of their characteristics and opportunities down the line might hold the answer.

Electronic Arts has built its business around popular licensed franchises and has successfully orchestrated a turnaround over the last five years thanks to improved quality of output and digital sales momentum. The company has sole rights to the NFL and FIFA brands and exclusive rights to make titles based on the Star Wars license. These are powerful properties that virtually guarantee a certain base level of sales -- reducing certain elements of risk and costs associated with developing new intellectual properties (IPs).
Acquiring licensing rights isn't cheap, but, at least in the case of its sports games, this model allows the company to release annual entries in big franchises that deliver updated rosters and statistics and new modes -- but otherwise have small production costs compared to most games that put up similar sales. This is one of the reasons that EA has recently delivered superior profit margins compared to Activision, and its margin advantage could become more pronounced as digital sales continue to make up a greater portion of each company's revenues. Both publishers are seeing profits on console game sales increase, but the benefit will be bigger for EA if its development costs remain lower.

That's not to say that EA isn't investing in new IPs, and upcoming properties like Anthem could spawn promising franchises, but most of its sales currently come from its licensed titles. The company does own some potent IPs, including the Battlefield, The Sims, and Need for Speed franchises, but there's been limited success in recent years when it comes to creating new properties with growth potential and staying power. The dependability of titles based on hit licenses and the strength of EA's own core IPs means that's not a dealbreaker, but it stands out as a notable point of distinction when comparing the company to Activision Blizzard. 
Activision Blizzard has the strongest lineup of original franchises among any third party video game publisher and an impressive history when it comes to creating new IPs. Of course, past performance does not guarantee future results, and Activision's reliance on developing and maintaining its own properties also has drawbacks.
Overwatch is one of the most successful new video game IPs of the last decade; Image source: Activision Blizzard.
There's good reason for the excitement that still surrounds its most recent new IP, Overwatch, but there are costly misfires worth remembering. As just one example, the company's Blizzard wing spent seven years developing Project Titan, a game that was intended to be the next big thing in the MMORPG genre but was ultimately canceled. Activision's focus on creating and owning its properties gives the company more upside potential, but it comes with increased risk as well.
Activision also holds some debt on its books while EA is cash positive, but the latter company paid down roughly $500 million against its loans last quarter and generates ample free cash flow to continue reducing what it owes. Activision added to its debt load in order to fund acquisitions, including the company's $5.9 billion purchase of Candy Crush Saga developer King Digital -- a move made to rapidly build its position in the mobile games market. The last fiscal year saw 25% of Activision's sales come from its mobile segment, while EA's mobile games accounted for only 4% of its revenues. With global spending of roughly $41 billion, the mobile games industry is larger and still growing faster than its console and PC counterparts, so Activision's edge in this category looks to be meaningful -- particularly as the company experiments with mobile advertising revenues and brings some of its hit IPs like Call of Duty to the space.
The strength of Activision's properties also looks to give the company better growth opportunities in esports and virtual reality and opens up big opportunities for merchandise sales and bridging its properties to film and television.  
Electronic Arts trades at a lower multiple while Activision Blizzard looks to have bigger growth potential, setting up a difficult choice between the two stocks. Investing in either company is likely a good play for the long-term investor looking for video game-industry exposure, but I think that the strength of Activision's properties, position in mobile, and history of innovation give it the edge. 
Activision Blizzard is already a leader in emerging categories like esports, with five of the 10 most-watched games on Amazon's Twitch and its own Major League Gaming network and distribution platform, and I think there's big potential in the company's recently launched consumer products division. Electronic Arts looks like a great business, particularly with CEO Andrew Wilson continuing the quality-improvement initiatives that propelled his company's turnaround, but none of its original properties standout as having comparable cross-medium potential to franchises like Overwatch, Call of Duty, and Destiny.
Investing in both companies could be the right move, but, if I had to pick one, I'd go with Activision Blizzard.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has had a heck of a run over the past half-decade. The video game maker's share price is up nearly tenfold since mid-2012, making it one of the market's best-performing stocks during this time:

EA data by YCharts.
Electronic Arts has continued its impressive run in 2017, rising more than 40% so far this year. More important to today's investor, however, is that the hard-charging game publisher appears poised to reward investors with even more gains in the years ahead. In fact, here are two reasons that Electronic Arts' best days may still be yet to come.
Imagine a stadium filled with thousands of fans cheering on their favorite teams. The excitement is palpable, with the crowd ready to erupt at every turning point in the game. Millions more fans around the world are eagerly watching the live stream of the sold-out event. And in the middle of it all are the game's most elite players battling for a championship.
Am I describing NFL football, or perhaps World Cup soccer? While that certainly could be the case, more and more often this scene is occurring in the burgeoning world of esports. In this new arena, the players are competitive gamers, and their virtual battles are increasingly taking place inside video games such as Electronic Arts' Madden NFL and FIFA Soccer.

Esports' growth has been staggering -- and it's just getting started. The worldwide audience for esports surged 36.6% to 323 million in 2016, according to market-intelligence company Newzoo, and is projected to exceed 589 million by 2020. Meanwhile, esports revenue surged 51.7% last year to $493 million, and is expected to grow to $1.5 billion by 2020.
To capitalize on this megatrend, EA's competitive gaming division recently inked deals with ESPN (a Disney property) and the NFL Network to expand coverage of its esports tournaments. ESPN agreed to televise and stream EA's FIFA Ultimate Team Championship Series in more than 60 countries around the world, while the NFL Network signed on to broadcast EA's Madden NFL Championship games.
To further boost distribution, EA struck agreements with Alphabet subsidiary YouTube, Amazon subsidiary Twitch, and Facebook to live-stream several of its esports events. Together, these deals should broaden Electronic Arts' audience and solidify its position as a primary beneficiary of esports' incredible growth.
While esports are boosting game sales and player engagement levels, another major trend is helping to lift EA's profits: the industrywide shift toward digital distribution. Digital downloads are less costly than shipping physical game packages, and they allow for additional monetization techniques such as the sale of in-game content -- both of which have led to higher margins and overall profits for video game makers.
Electronic Arts' gross margin improved to 73.2% in fiscal 2017, up from 69.2% in 2016; it was 62.3% back in fiscal 2014. Fueling that increase was a 20% jump in digital sales -- to more than $3 billion -- over the past year. ""We generated record net sales and operating cash flow in fiscal 2017, driven by our ongoing transition to digital as well as our increasing success with live services,"" CFO Blake Jorgensen said in the company's fourth-quarter press release.
Looking forward, EA expects its gross margin to rise to 74.9% in fiscal 2018, fueled by a larger percentage of digital game downloads and higher sales of in-game content. More digital revenue driving higher profits: That's a trend Electronic Arts investors can expect to continue for the foreseeable future, and one that should help the video game titan deliver further gains to shareholders in the years ahead.

The rally sent shares to new record highs, although EA's return this year has trailed that of its bigger rival, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).

Most of the stock's gain came after the company announced fiscal fourth-quarter results in early May. In that report, EA revealed surprisingly strong operating trends, with sales, profitability, earnings, and cash flow all beating management's guidance on the year.

""We generated record net sales and operating cash flow in fiscal 2017, driven by our ongoing transition to digital as well as our increasing success with live services,"" Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said in the early May press release .
EA enters its 2018 fiscal year with a huge pool of engaged gamers and a deep portfolio of valuable content that spans console, PC, and mobile gaming. Those tailwinds are projected to help push revenue up 5% for the year as gross profit margin expands to 75% of sales.
Sure, a botched title release in one of its biggest franchises would threaten those aggressive targets. But, barring an upset like that the business seems set to enjoy rising sales and record profitability thanks to rising demand for in-game purchases and full-game downloads.

            ","With the video game industry's ongoing shift to a digital distribution strategy, Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) gross margin continues to expand, reaching 73.2% in fiscal 2017, up from 69.2% the previous year. This was due to continued growth in full game downloads, extra in-game content, subscriptions, and mobile game sales.
Management's initial guidance for fiscal 2018 calls for gross margin to reach 74.9%, driven by growth of its popular in-game feature called Ultimate Team, which lets players build their own teams and play against others', in addition to the release of Star Wars: Battlefront 2, and mobile game sales. Ultimate Team revenue was 17% of EA's $4.8 billion in total revenue last year, and grew 29% in the fourth quarter.
We'll take a look at the opportunities EA has with respect to Ultimate Team and full game downloading that could help gross margin expand well beyond fiscal 2018.

Ultimate Team essentially serves as the gateway to esports for EA's top two sports titles. With Ultimate Team, gamers purchase in-game card packs, featuring real-world athletes. Whichever athletes players draw from a pack, they can use those athletes in-game to assemble dream teams, which players can then take online to compete with others in competitive game mode.
This has become a very appealing feature for Madden and FIFA, the only two games to include the Ultimate Team feature. Ultimate Team revenue has been driven mainly by FIFA 17, one of the top-rated sports games on console, as well as being one of the top-streamed games on Amazon.com's Twitch.tv, which is a popular destination for esports enthusiasts. A new story mode was included with FIFA 17 which was very popular and brought more people to the game. In turn, those people tried out Ultimate Team, helping FIFA grow its Ultimate Team player base 13% year over year through the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017.
It's quite an accomplishment for EA that one virtual mode makes up nearly one-fifth of the company's total revenue, especially when you consider all of the big games the company makes, like Mass Effect, The Sims, Battlefield, the Star Wars games, along with its popular sports titles.
The company could potentially create an even bigger business out of Ultimate Team by spreading the feature to other titles in the catalog. At a recent investor conference hosted by Morgan Stanley, CFO Blake Jorgensen said the company is looking at adding a similar element like Ultimate Team to the other competitive titles in EA's catalog (Quote via Gamesindustry.biz):
Like Battlefield or Battlefront, [or] our Star Wars game, which are very similar in the depth of play -- we can possibly add a similar mechanic to that. We spend a lot of time thinking about it. ... Not for tomorrow, but over the next couple of years you're going to see a lot more of that in our portfolio.
While I'm not sure how an Ultimate Team-like feature might work in Battlefield, a military-based shooter game, it's easy to imagine how successful a similar feature could work in Star Wars: Battlefront, given the popularity of the Star Wars universe, with all of the interesting weapons, settings, and characters that franchise has available. It seems like content tailor-made for a virtual card game.
Along with Ultimate Team, continued growth in full game downloading can also keep EA's gross margin ticking up in the coming years. Full game download revenue grew 44% to $724 million and made up 33% of unit sales in fiscal 2017. As more gamers choose to buy games direct over console instead of physically in-store, it means less inventory, such as game discs the company has to produce, and that should help margins gradually move higher over time.
Further growth in full game downloading could also spur more growth in sales of digital content, like Ultimate Team. According to research firm Nielsen, gamers who download their games direct to console spend more time playing games and spend more money on games than gamers who buy physical copies. 
Ultimate Team and full game downloads are just two factors impacting EA's gross margin. EA also has a growing revenue channel from mobile games that will help push digital revenue to a higher percentage of total revenue in the future. Altogether, EA has plenty of options to continue expanding margins well beyond the year ahead.

            ","If you're a 40-year-old investor, you're probably not planning on retiring for another 20 years or more. While that may be bit of a downer for those looking forward to the freedom that retirement can bring, the positive is that it gives you more than two decades to grow your investments as you prepare for that fateful day.
This ultra-long-term investment horizon can be a major advantage for you over other investors -- if you use it wisely. And one of the best ways to do so is to seek out stocks with growth opportunities that span across many years -- and even better, those that are fueled by major secular trends.
Read on to learn more about two such businesses.

As two of the largest video game publishers, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) are well-positioned to profit from two major global trends: surging demand for digital games and the exploding growth of esports.
Video games are one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world, and the industry's economic impact is staggering. In fact, the global games market is expected to produce $108.9 billion in total revenue in 2017, up from $101.1 billion in 2016, according to market intelligence company Newzoo. Moreover, Newzoo forecasts that by 2020 the industry will exceed $128 billion in sales.
The growing attraction of gaming among people of nearly all ages has been a boon for both Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard in recent years, as both companies have seen their stock prices surge along with their sales and cash production.

Activision Blizzard's game portfolio spans across the PC, console, and mobile markets, and includes massively popular franchises such as World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Destiny, Call of Duty, and Candy Crush, among others. Incredibly, people spent about 40 billion hours playing Activision Blizzard's games over the past year.
Fellow industry titan Electronic Arts dominates the sports game market with FIFA -- the best-selling console title in the world in 2016  -- and its stalwart Madden NFL franchise. Additionally, Electronic Arts holds exclusive rights to produce games related to the megapopular Star Wars universe, and the company has a strong-selling shooter game of its own in Battlefield.
Better still, Electronic Arts and Activision are benefiting from the trend toward digital distribution. Digital downloads are less costly than shipping physical game discs, and they allow for additional monetization strategies such as sales of expansion packs, upgrades, and other in-game content -- all of which helps to boost margins and overall profits for the major game makers.

In addition to these powerful trends, the global phenomenon that is esports should continue to help fuel Activision and EA's profits well into the future. Despite several years of torrid growth, esports' ascent may be just beginning. The global audience for esports surged 36.6% to 323 million in 2016, and Newzoo projects that it will exceed 589 million worldwide by 2020.
Activision is moving aggressively to seize this opportunity. The company recruited a team of well-respected sports media executives -- including former ESPN and NFL Network CEO Steve Bornstein -- to lead its esports division. It then signed a live-streaming deal with Facebook to broadcast its most popular esports games on Facebook Live. And now, Activision is building an entire professional esports league around its Overwatch franchise. The game's growth has been impressive since its May 2016 release, with already more than 30 million registered players and $1 billion in sales. If the popularity of Overwatch continues to surge, Activision's new esports league could eventually develop into a gold mine for investors. In fact, Activision CEO Robert Kotick believes that esports leagues could eventually rival traditional sports leagues like the NFL and NBA in terms of revenue generation.   Not to be outdone, EA's competitive gaming division recently inked deals with both the NFL Network and ESPN to expand coverage of its esports tournaments. ESPN in particular has been ramping up its coverage of competitive gaming on its website and family of TV channels, and these deals should help to further strengthen esports' -- and EA's -- presence on the major sports networks.
After years of stellar gains, Activision's and Electronic Arts' stocks no longer trade in the discount bin. At about 24 and 22 times forward earnings estimates, respectively, their shares reflect the (rightful) optimism surrounding these businesses, but these P/E multiples are not unreasonable considering that Activision and EA are expected to grow earnings at annualized rates of about 18% and 15%, respectively, over the next half-decade. It's also very possible that these growth forecasts prove to be conservative -- particularly if esports catches on faster than expected -- which would make their current share prices even better bargains than they appear.
All told, Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts offer investors an excellent way to profit from the long-term growth of the global video game market. Thus, investors who buy shares in these video game titans today are likely to be well rewarded in the years -- and potentially decades -- ahead.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) held its own separate conference in the lead up to this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conferences, presenting the first stage show in a week-long stretch that will play host to 2017's biggest concentration of video-game news.
The company gave video-game fans and industry watchers a look at some of the key upcoming games in its lineup and also highlighted important aspects of its corporate philosophy as it moves forward, with special attention given to incorporating player feedback and better realizing the potential of video games as a narrative medium.
Read on for coverage of the biggest announcements from EA's stage show and what the fresh developments mean for investors.

EA kicked off its conference by showcasing Madden NFL 2018, and while the franchise has become somewhat infamous for delivering relatively minor updates with most yearly releases, there are some big changes on the way for the company's long-running football series. CEO Andrew Wilson was eager to spotlight the game's new story mode, which will have players assume the role of an aspiring NFL player as he competes to make it as a professional athlete.
This year's versions of Madden on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC platforms will also be built with EA's Frostbite engine, which should help the company deliver the series' biggest visual leap in years. Wilson stated that the upcoming football game will be the most innovative Madden in years, and between the new story mode and improved visuals, it's fair to say that he's probably right.

FIFA 18 will also have a single-player story mode, a feature that was introduced in last year's version of the hugely popular soccer franchise and one that's been well received among its fan base. The company's efforts to build up its core sports series and improve their content offerings is a good sign and illustrates the ways it's addressing consumer concerns and adding value to its core brands that will probably translate to increased longevity and player engagement.
These are the types of additions that keep users coming back, which, in turn, creates the potential for more in-game content sales. While making sure annual installments in its sports games are more feature-rich will come with increased development costs, efforts to improve the quality of the products are likely to be in the company's long-term interest.
Star Wars: Battlefront 2 received more focus than any other game at EA's conference, and it looks as if the company is making big efforts to improve on the game's predecessor. While EA's 2015 Battlefront game posted solid sales, it received a good deal of criticism from players for being light on content, and EA's chief executive officer was keen to point out that the company had heard the critiques and used them as a source of guidance.
The upcoming sequel will feature a robust story mode, and Wilson stated that it would feature three times as much content as its predecessor. The game's core downloadable-content (DLC) expansions will also be made available for free; however, there will be items and customization options that players can purchase in-game.
This seems to be a nice middle ground, as the company aims to add value for players who might have reason to be skeptical about the Star Wars: Battlefront series while leaving the door open for in-game digital sales. It's a different approach from the one the company is taking with its World War I-themed shooter Battlefield 1, which will see a major new DLC launch in September that must be purchased to access, but it seems like the right move.

The push to improve the quality of its releases is also evident in the management of the NBA Live franchise -- a property that will be returning to action this year after spending some time on the bench. After a string of poorly received entries damaged the brand and saw it lose almost the entirety of its market share to Take-Two Interactive's NBA 2K series, EA opted not to deliver a new release in its basketball series, so that it could do a revamp and better meet player expectations.
From a visual standpoint, NBA Live 18 looks significantly better than previous games in the franchise, and it will also be shipping with a story mode. To what extent the series' return will be able to win consumers away from NBA 2K is hard to guess, but EA's decision to deliver a sizable free demo before the upcoming game's release indicates confidence in the revamped basketball series, and it's good to see the company isn't letting a valuable license go to waste.
EA's Need for Speed is also making a comeback, with a story mode that looks to take heavy inspiration from the popular Fast & Furious film franchise. The focus on weaving narrative content into its big games is a notable new strategy from the company.

In terms of new intellectual properties, the biggest unveil was Anthem. The game comes from Mass Effect developer Bioware and received a relatively quick introduction at EA's presser before being given a more in-depth reveal at Microsoft's E3 show. Bioware's new game seems to be generating lots of excitement, and its slick visuals and gameplay that invites players to navigate air, land, and sea with jet-pack-fitted characters suggest that there will be plenty of anticipation in the lead up to its 2018 release date. 
EA also took the wraps off A Way Out, yet another game from the company with an intense narrative focus and one that revolves around a cooperative play, as users attempt to guide their characters on a mission to escape from a prison.
Overall, Electronic Arts delivered a strong conference that demonstrated some exciting evolutions for its existing franchises and gave a look at a couple promising new properties. Outside of Anthem, the company's show was a bit short on surprises, but the company's lineup and overall direction gave reasons for both video-game fans and shareholders to be excited.

            ","Shares of video game specialist Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) jumped 19.5% last month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after the company reported another strong quarter. 
Fiscal fourth-quarter results were released in early May, showing revenue rose 17% to $1.53 billion while operating income jumped 34% to $717 million. Net income fell 37% to $566 million, or $1.81 per share, but that was due in large part to an income tax benefit a year ago transitioning to a loss in the most recent quarter.

Like its competitors Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive, EA is moving to a business that generates more revenue from digital sources, like mobile and add-ons for console games. Sixty-one percent of total revenue was from digital sources, or $3.03 billion, up 20% from a year ago. Management also said it expects fiscal 2018 revenue to be about $5.075 billion and net income to be $1.125 billion, or $3.57 per share. 
Video game companies are making a smart shift to digital revenue streams, and EA is no different. What'll be important to watch is whether or not growth continues well into double digits. Guidance for 2018 implies a growth rate of just 4.7%, which is low for a stock trading at 30.5 times forward earnings guidance. If growth doesn't pick up, this looks like a very expensive stock for today's market.

            ","In the past 12 months, some of the best-performing stocks on the market are video game producers, with Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) being the No. 1 performer in the S&P 500, up a staggering 60%.
In this episode of Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann look at the industry overall, and dive into the three biggest players that make up the vast majority of it: Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO). Find out how each company has accomplished such incredible growth, how things like microtransactions and mobile games have affected the industry, and some of the biggest risks and opportunities for each company.
A full transcript follows the video.


This video was recorded on May 26, 2017.
Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, May 26, and we're grabbing our controllers to navigate the red-hot world of video game stocks. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and that is David Kretzmann hmm-ing on the side.
David Kretzmann: This is why we pay you the big bucks, Dylan.
Lewis: I thought you might like that intro. Sometimes I try to not give you a heads-up about what I'm going to come in with, and see if I can catch you on surprise like that.
Kretzmann: I was impressed. Nicely done.
Lewis: David, I had you on last week. We talked about two tech names that were not doing so hot, Twilio and Yelp. Today, we're flipping it over. You're back with me this week to talk about a sector and a couple companies that have just been on fire so far in 2017.
Kretzmann: Yeah, some of the best-performing stocks of the year, including Activision and Electronic Arts, essentially that video game space which, as you mentioned, over the past year, and certainly year to date, they've been some of the best performers so far.
Lewis: And I know that this is a category that I think some investors dismiss. It's either something they can't really wrap their head around, because it is, in a way, new media. But, like you said, Activision Blizzard is actually the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 year to date, up over 60%. Take-Two Interactive, which we'll also touch on today, and Electronic Arts, both up over 40% year to date. So, this is certainly a category worth paying attention to if you're an investor.
Kretzmann: Yeah, not too shabby at all. I think Activision Blizzard was actually the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2014 or 2015 as well, so it isn't just this year. Over the last three to five years, all of these have been incredible investments.
Lewis: And when you hear about those types of gains, I think a lot of investors have to look at it and say, ""Is it too late to build up a position? What does this market look like? We've already seen a huge surge; are games going to look this attractive moving forward?"" We will try to answer that today, at least a little bit. Why don't we start out with the big fish in the space, Activision. I think a lot of Fools are probably familiar with this company. It's been a recommendation for quite some time, as you mentioned, going back to 2014. But, I think it's been involved in the premium services for over a decade.
Kretzmann: Yeah.
Lewis: And gamers might know this company for its Overwatch and Warcraft franchises, among some others. Recent quarter, the company hit new records for revenue, EPS, and cash flow. David, what's been fueling all that growth for them?
Kretzmann: You teed that up nicely. The company, essentially, has three different segments. You have Activision, which is probably best known for Call of Duty and Destiny, those shooter action games. Then, you have Blizzard, which is best known for the online multiplayer games like World of Warcraft and Overwatch. Then, a couple years ago, they acquired King Digital, which is mobile gaming, most famously Candy Crush.
Lewis: I feel like you can see someone playing Candy Crush on any metro commute, it's always there.
Kretzmann: It has some incredible staying power, we can talk about that. The main highlight for me this quarter, that Blizzard segment is really doing well thanks to Overwatch, which is now the eighth billion-dollar franchise in the company's overall portfolio of game franchises. That's pretty incredible for just a year. And it's Blizzard's fastest-growing new franchise ever. It's reached over 30 million players globally in less than a year after launch, it launched in spring of last year. That Blizzard segment, thanks to Overwatch, is doing really well. You're seeing their monthly active user count continue to tick up steadily thanks to Overwatch.
Lewis: This is, in some ways, kind of like the social media platforms we talk about, where there is that MAU number you can look at an addition to some of the more financial metrics, and get a sense of how these platforms and games are doing.
Kretzmann: Yeah, absolutely. One of the things to keep in mind with these video game companies is their quarter-to-quarter results and year-to-year results will be lumpy depending on the timing of a game release. Call of Duty, I'm not sure what sequel they're on, probably seven or eight at this point, but that's obviously huge. Pretty much anything that has Call of Duty on [it] will sell well, even if the reviews aren't all that great. So, that is something to keep in mind. Depending on when you have these new games developed and launched, you will see those numbers ebb and flow. But all in all, you do want to see that user count and overall user engagement continue to tick up over time, because that usually leads to pretty good financial results.
Lewis: In some ways, it's kind of like the movie studio business. You find something that resonates with your audience, and you milk, you keep putting out titles in that franchise, because you know it's a story, or the characters, or a storytelling approach, or something like that, that people just love, and they can't get enough of. So, you see that yearly releases or every other year releases for a lot of these titles.
Kretzmann: Yeah. That's been an overarching theme and revolution of the video game space. If you go back five or 10 years, primarily, you would go into the store and buy the physical disc of the game. In that case, the shelf life of the game wasn't necessarily that long. You needed to get that physical disc in front of customers, whether it was at Wal-Mart or GameStop or wherever. And if you didn't do well at that initial launch, then the shelf life of that game probably wouldn't be too long. But, the shift toward digital, where people are downloading the games, they're able to do microtransactions within the games, they're able to download extra maps or levels of the games over time, then all of the sudden you can buy a game in 2014 and still be playing it today, still be paying money as a player and a user of that game. That's part of the reason why you're seeing the profitability of all of these companies we're talking about today continue to tick up over time, because that digital revenue is high margin. Once you get those users and you're able to continue to engage with them over time, it doesn't cost a lot to sell another map to them digitally, where people can just download over the internet.
Lewis: And you can push updates to those users, too, right?
Kretzmann: Yeah, you're seeing a lot of live events and live updates and things like that. These games are very much a living entity. It's not like you're just buy one physical disc and then that's the only edition you have going forward. It will continue to evolve over time.
Lewis: And you see that in the company financials, too. Looking at the most recent quarter for Activision, online sales were up 50% year over year, and they now make up 80% of revenue, which is crazy. And some of that is the transition to digital away from physical with those games. I think some of that is also the acquisition of the King Digital property, and everything they have under their umbrella. One of the things that is interesting with Activision is, particularly relative to these other video game publishers, they actually have a surprising amount of goodwill on their balance sheet. About half their assets are in goodwill. For people who might not remember, goodwill is an intangible asset often tied to the difference between what you can actually tie value to and what you pay for something in an acquisition. Other times it's brought in with brand value and things like that. They bought King Digital for $6 billion a couple years ago, and that is part of that huge goodwill number. And I think a lot of people are wondering how that acquisition looks and what the property is doing for them.
Kretzmann: Yeah, to me that's the biggest question mark still with the company. When Activision acquired King back in late 2015, and that acquisition was announced, King had about 475 million monthly active users, almost half a billion, which is more than Twitter and a lot of these other social networks, so that's an incredible number. But that slow and steadily ticked downward each quarter up until now, where now it's at about 350 million monthly active users. But there are some bright spots there. The ratio of daily active users to monthly active users, so, essentially, the hyper-engaged users, is at a record high. And the people who are paying for the games are paying more each quarter. So, it's kind of like you have this small but growing base of really engaged people who are just playing Candy Crush like crazy, and they're paying a lot to upgrade through the game, and different things like that. Those people are paying more. That's how management will spin it. But I think overall, the question there is, how easy is it for them to replicate that success with Candy Crush, or is that all it's about. One thing that was interesting in the conference call this quarter was, they mentioned that Activision and King will be partnering up, and they'll look to build a Call of Duty mobile game. I think that could justify the acquisition to me even more than just bringing Candy Crush under your umbrella. But if they're able to use King's expertise in developing mobile games, and transition Call of Duty into the mobile space, that could be really interesting, and I could see that justifying the premium that they paid. Hopefully that would help them avoid having to write down that goodwill and admit that they paid too much for King. So, some things to like there, but for me, that's probably the biggest question mark with Activision, still to be determined.
Lewis: Looking over at one of the other big players in the gaming market, Electronic Arts is something that sports fans probably know very well, are very familiar with. They make some of the most popular sports games out there, including FIFA and Madden. They have tons of other franchises. Like Activision, EA is really enjoying the fruits of that transition to digital. You see it in their margins.
Kretzmann: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Their total sales in this most recent quarter was up 17%. Their digital sales up over 30%. And now their digital sales are over 60% of revenue. You're seeing their margins over the past few years, it's so clear, and it's a nice trend to see those margins on the top and bottom line, trending up. And the biggest contributor to the digital sales is what they call ""Ultimate Team."" This is within their sports franchises, whether it's Madden, NFL, FIFA, NHL, NBA Live. And Ultimate Team is kind of the combination of fantasy sports games like fantasy football or fantasy basketball and collecting trading cards. So, you're essentially building a team, and you get these different packs with players and other things. Over time, you're building a team, you're able to trade players, and it takes into account all sorts of things. If you're building a team, a FIFA Ultimate Team, it takes into account the demographic of the player. So, will a Brazilian soccer player get along with an Italian player? It takes into account all these different chemistry items. Last year, management said there were 2 million trades happening in FIFA Ultimate Team every second. So, the level of engagement of people who step into Ultimate Team is staggering.
Lewis: And the idea there, to clarify for listeners, is, I have an Ultimate Team, you have an Ultimate Team, and we have players who are looking to optimize the rosters, or maybe you have a player that I'm a particularly huge fan of and want.
Kretzmann: Right, exactly. You can trade and try to upgrade your team over time, and then you can buy the virtual currency, and maybe acquire certain players or certain packs or something. And you're competing against other players. In the sense of fantasy football where you draft your team and you're following those players, you're trying to fine-tune your team and you're competing against other people, this takes fantasy to a live-action level, where you're actually able to physically play the game, you're able to manage your team over time, and that's something that's really resonated with the players of these games. So that now makes up about 30% of their total digital revenue, that Ultimate Team segment. So, I really like how they're focused on that competitive gaming aspect, e-sports, is actually something that comes up a lot. Activision wants to become the ESPN of e-sports, and really focus on that elite level of players who are literally getting paid to play video games, and people will watch people play video games. Electronic Arts is more focused on individual players competing with one another, and I think they've done a really nice job of creating a really compelling, live, constantly updating experience where you're competing with tens of millions of people around the world, whether it's in FIFA or Madden. And so far, that's been a huge driver of their digital success.
Lewis: And you look at that, and you're like, well, this is something that they just could not have done before the internet enabled gaming to really take off. Back in the model of 15 years ago, where people were buying discs and they weren't on consoles that were connected, you were playing with your friends in your house. And it was nice because people had to buy the discs, but they didn't have all of these additional purchases that people could be making. The microtransactions, it seems, are becoming a growing and growing segment for a lot of these video game producers.
Kretzmann: Yeah. In the case of Ultimate Team, I think it launched in 2009, and initially it was an add-on feature that you needed to pay more for. So, you would buy the disc, and then you could buy access to this feature. But now with something that comes free initially, so anyone can join. But once you're in, you tend to be locked in, and you stick with it. And then I think a good amount of people end up spending money there. So, obviously, with Electronic Arts, that sports area is where they dominate. I also really like what they're doing to expand into the action and shooter genre, which are the biggest genres within the video game space. They have Battlefield 1, which was a huge hit last year, and that's performing better than the sequel to Battlefield 1, which is called Battlefield 4, which is a little confusing, I'm not sure how they came up with the names there. But, essentially, they're seeing higher engagement with Battlefield 1 than they were seeing with its predecessor over a comparable period. So, that's always nice to see.
They also have, essentially, a decade licensing agreement with Disney to pump out Star Wars games. Coming up this year you have Battlefront 2, which looks like a very compelling game. The first Battlefront reboot that Electronic Arts did a couple years ago, it got kind of timid reception from fans, but it looks like they've incorporated a lot of the feedback, and people are really excited about that game, so I think that will be a big hit for them. And, obviously, as you have more Star Wars movies coming out over the next few years, I think that puts them in a golden position. That also goes to mobile. There's the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes mobile game, which is sort of a similar concept to Ultimate Team, where you're able to trade the different characters and collect the characters, kind of a collecting fantasy game. The average user spends 162 minutes a day playing that game, and that number has steadily ticked up over the last year. I mean, that's about two and a half hours a day for the average user on that game. I don't know what that means for productivity in the world. 
Lewis: I would love to see that metric for Fools. [laughs] 
Kretzmann: I know. We could count it as research, though, so we have that perk. But, just, the level of engagement that they've been able to create just shows that they're producing some incredibly compelling content. By comparison, I think the average power user of Candy Crush is spending more like 35 minutes a day. In the case of this Star Wars mobile game, be careful when you download that, because you might lose a lot of time out of your day.
Lewis: Yeah, I don't know if I can afford that kind of time-suck. David, last but only least in the sense of market cap, we're looking at Take-Two Interactive. This is the publisher behind the Grand Theft Auto series, the NBA 2K franchise, so they have some sports exposure there. Take-Two is currently a fraction of the size of these other publishers. I think they're about a quarter to a fifth of the size of EA and Activision Blizzard. So, they're a little bit smaller, the profile is a little bit different there. I know the company recently announced a minor roadblock in the delay of its release of Red Dead Redemption 2 title. Can you talk little bit about what's going on with the company, and whether or not that's something people should worry about?
Kretzmann: Yeah. Red Dead Redemption 2 was originally supposed to come out late summer, early fall this year, 2017. They've delayed that release until spring 2018. Initially, that would raise a yellow flag, but taking a step back here. Take-Two Interactive has two major studios. They have 2K, does a lot of the sports franchises like NBA 2K, WWE. Then, they have Rockstar, which is the studio behind Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption. And Rockstar has a history, going back 15 years or so, of delaying virtually every major game that it comes out with, so this is really just par for the course. So, it's nothing to me that's very concerning. They're basically saying, we want to make sure this is the best we can possibly make it. And part of the reason they're delaying it is more and more people are getting the latest generation of consoles. So, you have PlayStation 4, Xbox One, that hardware is a significant upgrade from the previous generation of gaming consoles. So, they're saying, we can make this game even better to adapt to that later hardware.
So, for me, I would much rather they delay it six months or even a year, and make sure the game is as good as it can possibly be, rather than putting out a product that they feel is subpar. I think that's part of the reason why Grand Theft Auto has been an incredible franchise. Speaking to the power of this transition to digital, the last Grand Theft Auto was released in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V. But it still makes up 38% of the company's total sales today. That just shows you, more and more people are continuing to buy the game and play the game, and management says, Grand Theft Auto online, that online experience, continues to surprise us and beat our own expectations. With Take-Two Interactive now, about a quarter of their revenue comes from what they call recurrent consumer spending. I feel like they could come up with a better phrase than that.
Lewis: I have to ask you what it means.
Kretzmann: That's not a surprise. It's made up of the money that players will spend on virtual currency within the games, downloadable add-on content within the games, and microtransactions. Essentially, any money that players are spending in the game once they own that game. That's 25% of the revenue now. Again, that's very high margin, sticky revenue.
Lewis: It's all digital, right?
Kretzmann: Right, it's all digital. That just shows that, once players do download or buy these games, they're staying very engaged, and they're spending more money over time. In the case of Grand Theft Auto, you have a four-year separation between when the last title came out, but it's still contributing over a third of your total revenue. That's pretty astounding, and I think that's part of the reason that Take-Two is a little bit riskier. They still have a lot of dependence on Grand Theft Auto. But I don't see that drifting down at any point. There have been over 80 million units sold now of Grand Theft Auto V. So, it has an incredibly long shelf life as a franchise. In the meantime, you have Red Dead Redemption, which, the first one got rave reviews, there's a lot of anticipation for Red Dead Redemption 2, and since they're delaying it a few more months to make sure it's really the highest quality it can be, it'll probably be a pretty successful game. NBA 2K continues to have incredible engagement each year when they come out with a new NBA titles. Again, all these companies are excelling at finding ways to make really compelling games that are engaging over a long period of time. I think as you're transitioning to this digital area, that's really the key. All three of these companies are doing a really nice job at that.
Lewis: I get the sense in this conversation that, really, there's room for all of these companies to succeed, they all have their separately carved out niches. There's obviously going to be competition, particularly with sports licensing, for games, with Take-Two and EA, as those contracts come due. But, the sense that I get is, there's room for all these players to play.
Kretzmann: I think so. This is a global game as well. I don't know the exact breakdown for all the companies. But in the case of Electronic Arts, well over half their revenue comes from outside the U.S. FIFA is really a global phenomenon.
Lewis: It's huge abroad.
Kretzmann: Huge, yeah. That also means that can make it even more compelling if you're directly competing against literally tens of millions of players around the world. So, it makes it really interesting as a player to have that kind of opportunity to engage with players that way. I forget what your question was.
Lewis: It seems like plenty of room to operate for all of them.
Kretzmann: Yeah, the global market is huge. And as the economy worldwide improves, and steadily over time, the world economy is becoming more productive, people will have more leisure time. So, really the main competition for any of these kinds of companies are Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, YouTube, wherever you spend your leisure time, that's really the competition there. I recently watched an interview with Reed Hastings, the founder and CEO of Netflix, and he said the biggest long-term threat for Netflix is if, at some point, there is some content that's just so compelling that people get bored sitting down watching just something, dormant. That gives you a sense for how these media companies should be thinking about the long term. But I think people love being entertained, they love the chance to compete and connect with friends and other people around the world. I don't see this slowing down anytime soon. And, in the meantime, you have stuff, which, this is hard for me to wrap my mind around, but e-sports. You actually have people watching other people play video games. And that's something that's that was especially popular in Asia, but now in the U.S. and Europe, you're also seeing that on the rise, and more and more companies looking to sponsor, advertise at e-sports tournaments. So, I certainly see a long-term runway for this space, to continue doing well.
Lewis: I know that I was certainly guilty of thinking of e-sports as being more of a niche, novelty phenomenon. And it's clear that it has staying power, and it will be a huge tailwind for a lot of these businesses. It seems like a lot of things are moving in the right direction for these companies. Not surprisingly with the run these stocks have gone on, they're not cheap by any means on a typical P/E basis for valuation. All of them above market multiples right now. I teased that I would have to ask you if you had a favorite among the lot. Is there one that you particularly like, or think is a little bit better positioned right now, maybe a more attractive valuation, something like that?
Kretzmann: I'll probably give you a long answer here. The short answer is I like all three, I personally own all three, full disclosure there. Take-Two Interactive is really interesting if you're looking for a little bit higher-risk, high-reward situation. As you mentioned, they're quite a bit smaller than EA or Activation. They don't have quite the breadth of franchises that those two leading companies do. But, what I'm really impressed with is, even though they delayed Red Dead Redemption 2 to essentially the next fiscal year, they're still guiding for record profitability for this coming year, even though they don't have any other major titles slated to be launched this year. I think that's really impressive. And based on the guidance that management gave, they're only trading in about 18 times forward earnings. So, that's one that I'm taking a closer look at, because based on today's numbers, it does look a little bit pricier, but despite that major game delay to next year, they're still looking to do just fine. Activision is really interesting. I would look more and more at Activision as a miniature Disney, the way that they are approaching it. They want to become the ESPN of e-sports, so they have a new e-sports segment that's about a couple years old now. And they actually brought on the former head of the NFL Network and ESPN to head up this new e-sports segment under Activision Blizzard's umbrella. They recently launched a consumer goods segment, so, trying to bring that intellectual property to toys and --
Lewis: Merch.
Kretzmann: Yeah, stuff like that. So, really following Disney's footsteps there. They see opportunities for advertising, especially with those 350 million monthly active users on the King Digital mobile games. And they also have a movie and TV studio. So, they're trying to build out a cinematic universe for Call of Duty, which might be in the works over the next couple years.
Lewis: They've tried doing that a little bit with Warcraft, right?
Kretzmann: A little bit. That Warcraft movie wasn't under their own studio, that was an external studio, so they can't be blamed too much for that. It got kind of poor reviews. But, they do have a kids show, Skylanders Academy, based on their Skylanders game. The first season launched on Netflix last October, the second season is launching this year, and Netflix signed it on for a third year, so that's a promising start. But, with all those different segments, you can see that Activision probably has the biggest vision of all these different companies, just in terms of seeing their IP extending well beyond just the video games themselves.
So, if I had to pick one of them, it would probably be Activision. But I like the position that all of these are in. Take-Two, higher risk, high reward, I would probably make that a smaller position. EA, I love what they're doing with Ultimate Team, that competitive gaming aspect, especially with the sports games. I think having the access to that Star Wars IP and being able to pump out those games, I don't see how that doesn't do really well over the next few years as more Star Wars movies come out. And Activision has a whole breadth of different opportunities for them, and how they extend that IP beyond video games. So, I like all of them, but I think if you forced yourself to pick one, Activision would probably be the one. They pay a small dividend since 2010. They're just the bigger idea of the three. And why not just go with all three?
Lewis: Get a basket of video game stocks?
Kretzmann: Why not?
Lewis: David, anything else on video games or the industry before I let you go?
Kretzmann: No, I think that does it. I think this is a really attractive space. I personally don't play a whole lot of video games and I certainly don't watch other people playing video games, so I can understand, especially if you're not a younger investor, this might be a little bit more of a foreign industry to you. But, this is something to watch. I think these companies, these game franchises are going where customers are headed. People want engaging, compelling content, and these companies are delivering that. So, it's well worth the look as an investor.
Lewis: That's a nice thing to end on there. Listeners, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus. A little housekeeping note before we wrap up: I hope everyone has a good, long weekend. Take some time to think of all the individuals who have died while serving our armed forces on Memorial Day.

            ","Shares of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) have gained a heart-stopping 775% over the last five years, starting at the bottom of a difficult turnaround trough. Every investor would love to see returns like these in their own portfolio, but it isn't easy to separate the risk-laden gambles from the high-growth opportunities with lasting appeal.
So we asked a panel of three veteran Motley Fool contributors for their best investment ideas in the Electronic Arts mold. They came up with Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), and AU Optronics (NYSE:AUO). Read on to see how this cream rose to the top.
Image source: Getty Images.
 Anders Bylund (AU Optronics): I don't know how to match EA's fantastic returns without taking on a fair amount of risk. Those are the stakes when you're looking for extreme growth potential -- betting on the wrong horse could get expensive in a hurry.
With that caveat in mind, I'm going for Taiwanese LCD panel builder AU Optronics.
The company has seen its trailing sales slipping 35% lower in just three years while annual free cash flows evaporated from nearly $2 billion to just above breakeven. Share prices followed suit, and you can buy AU Optronics stock today for less than five times trailing earnings and 0.6 times the company's book value. In other words, current share prices imply that investors would be much better off if AU Optronics simply stopped doing business, sold off all its assets, and returned that cash directly to shareholders.
I don't think that's even close to correct, especially when you consider AU Optronics' solid bottom-line earnings and healthy balance sheet. LCD screens may not be the hottest idea in the display market anymore, but the company is moving forward with quantum-dot research and an emerging OLED screen business. AU Optronics also collected 7.4% of its 2016 revenue from its solar-power products.
Long story short, I like AU Optronics' chances of bouncing back from today's incredibly depressed valuation. The stock could double on little more than a convincing long-term business plan. That would be similar to EA's turnaround story, which also started with overly depressed valuations and a weakened but still solid fundamental business.
I could be wrong, so don't back up the truck on this recommendation. But AU Optronics could certainly be worth a small, speculative investment at today's bargain-bin prices.

Jordan Wathen (Bed Bath & Beyond): This bombed-out retail stock could end up delivering stellar returns if it proves to be one of retail's survivors.
Retail is in the midst of a secular shift from offline to online sales, but Bed Bath & Beyond has some positive tailwinds in the form of increased household formation and a robust housing market. Online sales have grown at about 20% per year for several years running, juiced by promotions and lower-margin sales that have recently weighed on the home goods retailer's profitability.
The good news is that the company throws off lots of cash -- free cash flow tallied to $668 million last year against a current market cap of about $5 billion. The bad news is that this free cash flow is mostly plowed back into share repurchases. The company bought back about $547 million of stock last year at prices higher than where shares trade today. With a $1.7 billion repurchase authorization, and a history of cannibalizing its share count, it seems likely that repurchases will remain its primary way to return cash to shareholders.
If Bed Bath & Beyond proves to be a survivor in the home goods and decor retailing segment, shareholders should be richly rewarded as it buys back its own stock at a depressed, single-digit multiple of free cash flow.
This is a binary investment -- it's an all-or-nothing play. Shareholders could see a double or triple, or nothing at all. It's not for the faint of heart, but when you set your return target as high as we have with Electronic Arts, you have to be willing to shop the bargain bin, where the offerings are likely to be beaten-up.

Keith Noonan (Weibo): Shares of Chinese microblogging platform Weibo have already tripled over the last year, but the incredible rate at which the platform is growing suggests its best days might still be ahead. Like Twitter, the social media site revolves around sending short messages and pictures, and is also growing as a video platform. It's been delivering stellar top- and bottom-line results, and looks to be in much-better shape than its American counterpart. 
Per its most recent quarterly report, Weibo counted 340 million monthly active users -- an increase of 30% year over year. The company has also been driving increased engagement and monetization from its user base, with second-quarter revenue increasing 67% over the prior-year period, and net income up 561%. With increasing demand for its advertising services and partnerships with leading Chinese web giants Alibaba and Sina, the company looks primed to continue delivering stellar sales and earnings growth.
Weibo has become ingrained in Chinese pop culture and stands as the most popular open forum for the country's internet users to discuss their favorite celebrities, media content, and hobbies. Data from the state-run China Internet Information Network Center indicates that roughly 730 million people in the country currently connect to the web, suggesting that roughly 47% of the country's internet users are also on Weibo's platform. That's stellar engagement and points to the company benefiting from, and being able to continue to leverage, a significant network effect -- particularly as internet use keeps growing in China.

            ","Investors love companies with a compelling story of growth potential, because these stocks can deliver big-time profits as the thesis plays out. But not all story stocks live up to the hype. Sometimes the numbers just don't match the story, while other times a company's management team can be squandering its opportunity. That's why investors need to take a step back and make sure a company's performance matches its expectations. 
With this potential pitfall of getting caught up in the hype in mind, our contributors took a critical look at three story stocks: Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), DryShips (NASDAQ:DRYS), and Snap (NYSE:SNAP). Only one of the companies seems to be living up to all the hype, in our opinion. 
Image source: Getty Images.
Rich Duprey (Snap): Although a lot of the ebullience is gone from social-media platform Snap following its IPO three months ago, its stock continues to bounce back as investors keep hoping it will find the magic formula to succeed. You'll do your portfolio a solid if you just stay away from Snap altogether.
Even at a price that's 27% below the high it hit out of the gate, it's still vastly overvalued. Its $25 billion market cap means the market is willing to pay 50 times sales for a company that's producing losses north of half a billion dollars. User growth continues to fail to impress, it's been forced to offering discounts to attract advertisers, and there's still no effective counter to competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and its own photo-sharing site, Instagram.
In its first-quarter earnings report last month that many had been watching to see what direction it would be heading, user growth was up 36% year over year, a not too bad result on the surface, but just another indication that growth was decelerating. Snap reported 48% growth in the fourth quarter and 63% growth in the third quarter. In fact, a year ago Snap's user growth rate was almost 53%. It's clear it will plateau sooner rather than later.
Snap also can't decide what it wants to be. Its decision to rebrand itself as a camera company, and to buy drone company Ctrl Me Robotics -- not to mention its Snap Spectacles eyeglasses -- ought to be a caution to investors that it's confused about where it wants to go. As if Instagram and WhatsApp are enough competition, it will be going up against bigger and better financed companies, such as GoPro.
There's still way too much hype attached to Snap's stock and investors would do well to ignore it.
Matt DiLallo (DryShips): Diversified ocean-going cargo shipper DryShips is one of the most-hyped stocks around these days. Fueling that enthusiasm is its current penny-stock-like price, which traders see as their ticket to big-time profits as the company turns itself around. It's a turnaround that certainly makes sense now that company has shored up its balance sheet, which should enable it to take advantage of the recent rebound in shipping rates.
But while DryShips is a compelling turnaround story, it also has one fatal flaw: Its management team chose to take advantage of investor enthusiasm and flood the market with new equity, which it used to rebuild its decimated fleet as quickly as possible. In total, the company raised $570 million in cash this year to buy 17 new vessels. While those ships have the potential to deliver $77 million in annualized earnings if shipping rates hold up, which could completely reverse its recent string of losses, investors paid a tremendous price in the form of dilution.
For example, during the first quarter, the company had an average of 15.5 million shares outstanding, and it ended the period with 67.4 million shares. That is a breathtaking increase from the year-ago period when it had just 13,901 shares outstanding after taking into account the impact of a cumulative 1-for-48,000 in reverse splits it had completed over the past year. That's an overwhelming amount of dilution for investors and is the main reason the stock is down 99% since the start of the year. 
While many investors think the stock has nowhere to go but higher, that dilution could continue to act as a weight for quite some time. Further, given that the company has proved time and again that its primary focus isn't on creating value for investors but instead on using them to line the pockets of its CEO, more dilution could be on the way. That's why investors shouldn't listen to the hype that DryShips could turn a small investment into a big-time profit. It has historically done nothing but obliterate value.

Daniel Miller (Electronic Arts): If you grew up playing video games, you're familiar with Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). In fact, if you favored sports games, you can probably still hear the ""EA Sports"" intro ringing in your head. Investors who jumped on board the EA bandwagon half a decade ago have been heavily rewarded.

EA data by YCharts
But after such rapid growth over the past five years, should you still buy into the hype? I say yes.
There are a few trends that bode well for EA going forward. The gaming world is growing, both in its player base and in terms of consumer revenue. EA estimates that the gaming global market forecast will jump from $75.9 billion in 2014 to $96.6 billion during the 2018 calendar year. Further, top titles are driving greater share -- in other words, big blockbuster games are bigger than ever -- and fewer companies are generating those blockbusters. EA is well positioned to benefit from the consolidating trend. 
But EA is so much more than it used to be. While it still dominates sports games, which is great because those games come out with new iterations each year and drive recurring revenue, it has branched out into mobile games as well. Going forward in the digital world, there are even more ways for EA to generate incremental revenue and engagement. Consider ""The Vault,"" a subscription engagement model for EA, which would let players subscribe to play a list of titles in the vault as much as they wanted, with more titles being added over time.
We're also approaching a point when e-sports, or competitive video-gaming, is starting to find its way onto television sets. If management can continue to develop blockbusters, branch out further with mobile gaming, and capitalize on the growing e-sports trend, buying into the hype is a no-brainer.

            ","In both 2017 and the last 12 months, the gaming industry has seen massive growth, and its investors have been well rewarded.
In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann dive into one of the biggest companies in the space with huge growth in the last few years, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). Listen in to find out how EA makes the majority of its revenue and why it's so promising for the company's future, what strategies EA is taking to diversify its offerings, how it is tapping into consumer appetite for franchise material, and more.
A full transcript follows the video.


This video was recorded on May 26, 2017.
Dylan Lewis: Looking over at one of the other big players in the gaming market, Electronic Arts is something that sports fans probably know very well, are very familiar with. They make some of the most popular sports games out there, including FIFA and Madden. They have tons of other franchises. Like Activision, EA is really enjoying the fruits of that transition to digital. You see it in their margins.
David Kretzmann: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Their total sales in this most recent quarter was up 17%. Their digital sales up over 30%. And now their digital sales are over 60% of revenue. You're seeing their margins over the past few years, it's so clear, and it's a nice trend to see those margins on the top and bottom line, trending up. And the biggest contributor to the digital sales is what they call ""Ultimate Team."" This is within their sports franchises, whether it's Madden, NFL, FIFA, NHL, NBA Live. And Ultimate Team is kind of the combination of fantasy sports games like fantasy football or fantasy basketball and collecting trading cards. So, you're essentially building a team, and you get these different packs with players and other things. Over time, you're building a team, you're able to trade players, and it takes into account all sorts of things. If you're building a team, a FIFA Ultimate Team, it takes into account the demographic of the player. So, will a Brazilian soccer player get along with an Italian player? It takes into account all these different chemistry items. Last year, management said there were 2 million trades happening in FIFA Ultimate Team every second. So, the level of engagement of people who step into Ultimate Team is staggering.
Lewis: And the idea there, to clarify for listeners, is, I have an Ultimate Team, you have an Ultimate Team, and we have players who are looking to optimize the rosters, or maybe you have a player that I'm a particularly huge fan of and want.
Kretzmann: Right, exactly. You can trade and try to upgrade your team over time, and then you can buy the virtual currency, and maybe acquire certain players or certain packs or something. And you're competing against other players. In the sense of fantasy football where you draft your team and you're following those players, you're trying to fine-tune your team and you're competing against other people, this takes fantasy to a live-action level, where you're actually able to physically play the game, you're able to manage your team over time, and that's something that's really resonated with the players of these games. So that now makes up about 30% of their total digital revenue, that Ultimate Team segment. So, I really like how they're focused on that competitive gaming aspect, e-sports, is actually something that comes up a lot. Activision wants to become the ESPN of e-sports, and really focus on that elite level of players who are literally getting paid to play video games, and people will watch people play video games. Electronic Arts is more focused on individual players competing with one another, and I think they've done a really nice job of creating a really compelling, live, constantly updating experience where you're competing with tens of millions of people around the world, whether it's in FIFA or Madden. And so far, that's been a huge driver of their digital success.
Lewis: And you look at that, and you're like, well, this is something that they just could not have done before the internet enabled gaming to really take off. Back in the model of 15 years ago, where people were buying discs and they weren't on consoles that were connected, you were playing with your friends in your house. And it was nice because people had to buy the discs, but they didn't have all of these additional purchases that people could be making. The microtransactions, it seems, are becoming a growing and growing segment for a lot of these video game producers.
Kretzmann: Yeah. In the case of Ultimate Team, I think it launched in 2009, and initially it was an add-on feature that you needed to pay more for. So, you would buy the disc, and then you could buy access to this feature. But now with something that comes free initially, so anyone can join. But once you're in, you tend to be locked in, and you stick with it. And then I think a good amount of people end up spending money there. So, obviously, with Electronic Arts, that sports area is where they dominate. I also really like what they're doing to expand into the action and shooter genre, which are the biggest genres within the video game space. They have Battlefield 1, which was a huge hit last year, and that's performing better than the sequel to Battlefield 1, which is called Battlefield 4, which is a little confusing, I'm not sure how they came up with the names there. But, essentially, they're seeing higher engagement with Battlefield 1 than they were seeing with its predecessor over a comparable period. So, that's always nice to see.
They also have, essentially, a decade licensing agreement with Disney to pump out Star Wars games. Coming up this year you have Battlefront 2, which looks like a very compelling game. The first Battlefront reboot that Electronic Arts did a couple years ago, it got kind of timid reception from fans, but it looks like they've incorporated a lot of the feedback, and people are really excited about that game, so I think that will be a big hit for them. And, obviously, as you have more Star Wars movies coming out over the next few years, I think that puts them in a golden position. That also goes to mobile. There's the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes mobile game, which is sort of a similar concept to Ultimate Team, where you're able to trade the different characters and collect the characters, kind of a collecting fantasy game. The average user spends 162 minutes a day playing that game, and that number has steadily ticked up over the last year. I mean, that's about two and a half hours a day for the average user on that game. I don't know what that means for productivity in the world. 
Lewis: I would love to see that metric for Fools. [laughs] 
Kretzmann: I know. We could count it as research, though, so we have that perk. But, just, the level of engagement that they've been able to create just shows that they're producing some incredibly compelling content. By comparison, I think the average power user of Candy Crush is spending more like 35 minutes a day. In the case of this Star Wars mobile game, be careful when you download that, because you might lose a lot of time out of your day.

            ","The video game industry has seen impressive growth over the past few years, and that isn't likely to change anytime soon. Market intelligence firm Newzoo has forecast that gaming will produce $109 billion in revenue in 2017, up nearly 8% over last year, and that figure is estimated to grow to nearly $129 billion by 2020. 
With that much revenue at stake, what are the best gaming stocks for investors in 2017? Several companies have exhibited impressive performance over the past several years, and that trend is likely to continue. Top choices in the space include Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO).

A company that was once considered a one-trick pony for its World of Warcraft franchise, Activision Blizzard has diversified its offerings to become one of the leading players in the gaming industry. While the company once generated revenue solely from the sale of cellophane-wrapped games in stores, it now generates revenue in a variety of ways, including digital downloads and in-game add-ons.
Activision has a stable of eight franchises that have each generated more than $1 billion in revenue: StarCraft, Diablo, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Destiny, Overwatch, Call of Duty, and Skylanders.
The company bought King Digital early last year to gain a foothold in the burgeoning mobile game market, which brought Candy Crush and Bubble Witch into the fold. The company has plans to roll out some of its hit franchises to mobile in the near future. Activision also sees the future of gaming in e-sports, in which games become a spectator sport, and recently announced an e-sports league play for its hit Overwatch, which will begin later this year.
In the most recent quarter, Activision's revenue grew to a record $1.73 billion, up 19% over the prior-year quarter. Revenue from digital channels was a record $1.39 billion, up 50% year over year, and now represents 80% of total revenue. Net income also set a record of $0.56, a 17% increase over the prior-year quarter.

Electronic Arts is probably best known for its FIFA 17, the best-selling console game in the world, according to the company,  its ubiquitous Madden NFL, and Battlefield 1, which reportedly saw the largest launch in the company's Battlefield franchise to date. The company also made many ""best of"" lists in 2016 with Titanfall 2. The company has been transitioning from a model dependent on yearly game releases to one embracing downloadable digital content, mobile games, and e-sports. Popular mobile offerings include Plants vs. Zombies and The Sims. EA recently signed an agreement with ESPN to broadcast competitive gameplay of its FIFA Ultimate Team Championship.
In its most recent quarter, EA reported revenue of $1.5 billion, up 17% over the prior-year quarter. Digital revenue was $934 million, up 30% year over year, representing 61% of the total. Net income was $1.81 per share, compared with $2.79 in the prior-year quarter, but this is misleading since backing out a one-time tax benefit from the prior-year quarter's results leads to a better comparison, with net income of $1.81 compared with the prior-year quarter's earnings of $1.42, a 27% increase. The company also announced that its first quarter generated over $1 billion in operating cash flow.

Take-Two Interactive is the smallest of the three but could have the most to gain. Another company that was previously branded a one-hit wonder for its Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise, Take-Two has evolved with the introduction of hit games Red Dead Redemption, BioShock, and Borderlands, though it's still highly dependent on the success of its flagship GTA.
Take-Two has been making strong moves in the mobile gaming segment and announced in its most recently quarterly financial release that it had acquired privately held Social Point S.L. for $250 million. Social Point is a highly successful free-to-play mobile game developer, which will help the company in its mobile aspirations. Take-Two already has a good start, as NBA2K17 is among the top mobile apps.  
In Take-Two's most recent quarter, it reported revenue of $476.5 million, up 15% from the prior-year quarter. Digital revenue grew 64% to $240.2 million and represented 50% of total sales. The company reported a $29.8 million loss, compared with a $42.4 million in the year-ago period, though it expects to be profitable for the coming year.

Growth in the gaming industry has been on a tear, and while the broader market is up 28% over the past three years, each of these three companies has trounced those results by a wide margin. Although historical returns are no guarantee of future performance, it can be a good indicator, and with gaming likely to continue its torrid growth, these three companies offer investors a great place to start.

            ","Over the past few years, the e-sports industry expanded from small professional gaming events into televised and live-streamed programs watched by millions. Goldman Sachs valued the e-sports market at $500 million in 2016, and expects the market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22% over the next three years to over $1 billion.
But amid all the hype and noise, investors might be confused about which companies will benefit the most from that growth. Let's examine three companies that fit that bill -- Tencent Holdings (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).
Chinese tech giant Tencent is the biggest video game company in the world by total revenue. Six years ago, it acquired Riot Games, the maker of League of Legends -- the MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game which is currently the most popular e-sports title in the world.

Research firm Newzoo's most recent numbers (from March 2017) reveal that 31% of Twitch viewers watched a League of Legends game during that month, with over 90 million hours being viewed across the network. To monetize that audience, Tencent and Riot Games recently co-founded a new e-sports TV channel in China with Chinese game publisher Perfect World and IPTV. 
Tencent also recently relaunched its PC digital storefront as WeGame, a Steam-like platform for its games, and revealed plans to build an e-sports-themed park in China to promote its top franchises. In addition to League of Legends, Tencent owns the hit mobile game Clash of Clans, a wide variety of first-party and licensed titles, and minority stakes in other game publishers like Activision Blizzard. Those firm foundations should continue boosting Tencent's gaming revenue, which rose 16% annually last quarter and accounted for 42% of its top line.
Tencent's Riot Games holds the top spot in overall Twitch viewership, but four other top ten titles -- Hearthstone, Starcraft II, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm -- are published by Activision Blizzard. Hearthstone, which ranks fourth, is a card game which features collectible cards. Fifth-place Starcraft II is a popular real-time strategy game, sixth-place Overwatch is a first-person shooter, and eighth-place Heroes of the Storm is a MOBA.

Last year, Activision CEO Bobby Kotick told the New York Times that he planned to build the ""ESPN of video games"" to capitalize on the growing e-sports market. To do so, Activision acquired the assets of the IGN Pro League in 2013, then bought nearly all the assets of Major League Gaming (MLG) in late 2015. That same year, it launched a dedicated e-sports unit and hired Steve Bornstein, the former CEO of ESPN and the NFL Network, as its new chief. 
Last year, Activision signed a live-streaming deal with Facebook to broadcast its most-watched games on Facebook Live. It then established a new e-sports league for Overwatch which consists of player contracts, teams, and playoffs. All these moves indicate that if e-sports ever become as big as football or basketball, Activision Blizzard will be well poised to profit.
Activision's rival Electronic Arts spent more time expanding its mobile gaming portfolio in recent years than investing in e-sports, but it has some ambitious plans for the future. In late 2015, EA launched its own e-sports unit, dubbed the Competitive Gaming Division, and assigned COO Peter Moore to lead the business as its ""chief competition officer.""
Last June, the unit announced new competitive gaming competitions for its own titles, which included four EA-owned and operated tournaments called ""majors"" for top games like Madden NFL 16 and Battlefield 1. EA offered up to $1 million in prizes throughout the series -- matching the average prize pool of major competitions across the industry. 
EA still has a lot of catching up to do. None of its games have broken into Twitch's top ten yet, and it cancelled Dawngate, its potential MOBA challenger to League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm, in 2014. It also hasn't sealed any big broadcasting or streaming deals like Tencent and Activision yet. Nonetheless, the strength of EA's gaming portfolio and its creation of a dedicated e-sports unit indicate that the company could still catch up quickly.
It's unclear if e-sports will ever become as popular as traditional sports, but one thing is certain -- a growing number of people are spending time watching other people play games. For companies like Tencent, Activision, and EA, that shift enables dedicated gamers to promote their games to an interested audience -- something which can't be guaranteed by costlier TV or internet ads. 
Therefore, companies that have a better grasp on the e-sports market might reduce their marketing spend while boosting the sales and longevity of their titles. If the e-sports market truly takes off, sponsorship revenue from dedicated e-sports channels and leagues could become major pillars of growth for game publishers in the future.

            ","If you're interested in video game stocks but don't understand the differences among the major three U.S.-based companies -- Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) -- I'll give you a basic rundown of where each company stands to help you make the right decision for your portfolio.
First, I'll say up front that each of the three is good at making great games that sell. Each has its hit games that attract millions of players, so there isn't one that has an advantage over the others in game-development talent. All three generate over $1 billion in annual revenue and generate a healthy amount of cash flow and, therefore, can afford to hire the cream of the crop among game designers and programmers.

That said, here are some of the finer points about the similarities and differences every investor should know when making a decision about buying a video game stock -- or all three.
Take-Two generates the bulk of its revenue on a few hit titles, including Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K. For that reason, Take-Two has the highest risk. Activision and EA, on the other hand, generate revenue across a spectrum of console, PC, and mobile games. Activision Blizzard has eight franchises with at least $1 billion in life-to-date revenue, and EA has several top console games, including Battlefield; best-selling sports games, including Madden NFL and FIFA; and the classic PC game The Sims.
Figures in millions, except P/E (price-to-earnings ratio). Data source: Company press releases and annual reports. P/E data from Yahoo! Finance.
Both EA and Activision Blizzard have made big splashes in mobile gaming. EA has gradually pieced together a diversified portfolio of mobile games through several acquisitions over the years. Today, EA has the wildly popular Monopoly Game and Plants vs. Zombies in its mobile game lineup, among others.
Activision was slow to get into mobile gaming but made a big impression with the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment for $5.9 billion in 2016. The company now owns the rights to titles including Candy Crush and Bubble Witch. Activision's purchase of King wasn't really a splash but more like a cannonball jump off the diving board.
With the recent $250 million announced acquisition of mobile-game studio Social Point, Take-Two hasn't made big splashes yet; it's merely gotten its feet wet. However, Take-Two did make a big move recently in e-sports, with its joint announcement with the NBA to create the NBA 2K eLeague. E-sports makes gaming into a spectator sport.
EA is also pursuing e-sports and has set up a division within the company to manage its opportunities in that fast-growing global market. Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard is currently sweet-talking prospective owners to buy teams for the new Overwatch League, which is set to commence later this year.
Activision Blizzard and EA are more diversified than Take-Two, which is reflected in Take-Two's smaller annual revenue compared with its rivals. But all three are pursuing e-sports and mobile gaming to varying degrees. Each company has its unique hit games it depends on to generate revenue and profit year to year, and each company pumps out annual top-rated games that show up on the best-sellers chart.
If I had to choose one, my favorite is Activision Blizzard for its diversification and the robust annual cash flow the company generates from that diversification. Plus, Activision is the only one to pay a dividend (yielding 0.54% at the current stock price), which speaks to its financial strength over the others and maybe hints that Activision is more shareholder-friendly. However, all three stocks have generated huge returns for shareholders over the past five years, and the industry looks set for more good times to come, so I'm a big fan of going with the basket approach by investing an equal amount in all three.

            ","The markets were a little shaky this week, in part because of President Donald Trump's tweet storm and firing of FBI Director James Comey. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both tumbled 0.35% and 0.53%, respectively, for the week, although both continue to trade near record highs. 
With that said, there were plenty of stocks making big moves or big headlines as earnings season winds down. Here are highlights from a CEO on the hot seat, a gaming stock on fire (in a good way) and a retailer shaking things up.
Image source: Getty Images.
Whether it's sports or stocks, coaches or CEOs, nobody likes to be on the hot seat. However, for both Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) investors and CEO Mark Fields, his seat is heating up. A few days before Ford's annual meeting of shareholders on May 11, it was reported that the automaker's board of directors was applying pressure on Fields about his strategy to improve profits faster and how best to light a fire under a stagnant share price.
""This is the first public sign that the board is becoming impatient,"" said David Whiston, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., according to Automotive News. ""It's likely proof that the board is frustrated with the stock price languishing for the past several years. It may be a grilling session for Mark."" 
It's easy to share frustration with the stock price, and despite a bumpy first quarter, the company has generated record level profits in recent years, but rather than sending its stock price soaring, it merely sent its valuation multiples lower. Fields is in between a rock and a hard spot, because the company's long-term future can't afford to ignore the evolution of autonomous vehicles, smart mobility projects, and the electrification of vehicle fleets. Those cost a lot of money to develop now, and the payoff is far down the road. Adding to the tense mood surrounding Ford, the board of directors, and investors, was news that Chantel Lenard, executive director of U.S. marketing and a 25-year Ford employee, will leave in June to ""pursue other interests,"" according to Ford.
There's no great answer for the folks at the Blue Oval, or Fields for that matter, because the market is what it is. It rewards Tesla, which is burning through cash at a record rate and selling a handful of vehicles compared to Ford, yet with a market capitalization larger than Ford's. Fields' seat is growing hotter, but let's be honest: Who would better serve Ford in the CEO position right now?
Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) is an intriguing stock if it can capitalize not only on its games but also on the emerging trend of e-sports, which is a form of competition on electronic systems and video games. Even though e-sports just recently emerged onto the mainstream stage, rather than being limited to a niche of serious gamers, EA's stock has been absolutely soaring on the backs of its number of games -- its stock price is up a staggering 650% over the past five years. And if the company's recent fiscal fourth quarter is any indication, which pushed the stock 15% higher on Wednesday, this game is far from over. 
Revenue was up 16.7% during the fourth quarter to $1.53 billion, which was better than analysts' estimates calling for $1.49 billion. And don't let the company's net income percentage decline fool you -- it was down 37% to $566 million -- because that was largely an issue with an income-tax credit during last year's quarter. That $566 million net income equated to $1.81 per share, which was far ahead of the $1.63 analysts had expected.
In all, this was a brilliant year from EA, as it generated record net sales and operating cash flow for the year, driven by groundbreaking games and its continued improvement in the digital and mobile world of games. Here's part of a quote from CFO Blake Jorgensen that caught my eye: ""Our long-term vision, to leverage deep player engagement to drive growth and profitability, is enabling us to execute on our near-term financial goals to increase revenue, earnings, and cash generation."" 
To me, deep player engagement goes hand-in-hand with the spreading and increasingly popular e-sports niche, which fills tournaments with professional and dedicated players. With the stock's 650% increase over the past five years, investors could be cautious about jumping in now, but this could still be the early innings of a long-term winner.
Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM) was a massive success story for investors between 2009 and 2014, but since then it's been tough sledding and a growth story stuck in neutral. Investors were left even more confused after a week that delivered second-quarter results as well as an announced switch-up with its board of directors and chief financial officer.
As far as financial information goes, Whole Foods delivered roughly in line with analysts' estimates. Revenue checked in at $3.74 billion, just above estimates, and its earnings per share checked in at $0.37, matching the analysts. On the downside, its comparable-store sales declined 2.8%, and the board-of-directors shake-up overshadowed much of the earnings release. 
More specifically, five new independent members were nominated to replace the same amount of retiring directors. The moves come after activist investor Jana Partners, which owns a 9% stake in Whole Foods, applied pressure in hopes management would focus on operational improvements and look to sell the company.
With all the drama going on, it's easy to lose sight of what matters: Management simply needs to focus on returning to positive comparable-store sales and earnings by the end of its next fiscal year. If it can do that, many of its issues will solve themselves.

            ","Last October, video-game giant Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) launched the latest installment in its long-running Battlefield series of first-person-shooter video games, known as Battlefield 1.
The game got off to a robust start, with Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson noting on the company's earnings call in January that Battlefield 1 represented the company's ""biggest Battlefield launch ever.""
Image source: Electronic Arts, via The Verge.
He also said that the ""unique player base of Battlefield 1 is more than 50% larger than that of Battlefield 4 in its comparable launch quarter,"" noting that ""more than a third of the players being new to the franchise or new to [Electronic Arts].""
On Electronic Arts' May 9 earnings call, management provided an update on Battlefield 1's commercial progress. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the news is good.
""Battlefield 1 continued its outstanding start, with more than 19 million players joining the game through the end of [fiscal year] 2017,"" Wilson said.
The executive also noted that this figure represented ""a 50% increase over Battlefield 4 in the same period from launch.""
Wilson also said the company's ""community of Battlefield fans is growing as new players join loyal franchise fans, driving engagement and player satisfaction levels to be among the highest in [Electronic Arts'] portfolio.""
To try to keep the momentum up, Electronic Arts says it's planning to introduce additional content for Battlefield 1, with Wilson noting that ""every Battlefield 1 player will have more ways to play throughout the year, with continual game updates, new maps, and three more expansion packs adding new armies, regions, and battlegrounds available to the whole community.""
Electronic Arts also develops titles in the Star Wars Battlefront series. These games are first-person shooters like the Battlefield titles, but they're based in the Star Wars intellectual property rather than on Electronic Arts' in-house Battlefield intellectual property.
Later this year, Electronic Arts plans to launch a sequel to Star Wars Battlefront (which launched in 2015) called Star Wars Battlefront II.
Image source: Electronic Arts via TweakTown
According to Wilson, Battlefront II ""will have more than three times the content of the previous game at launch, with a brand-new story, a new single-player campaign, new modes, characters, vehicles, and planets from all eras in the Star Wars universe, as well as a live service plan that will continue to add even more fun for the global community.""
Electronic Arts Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen noted that the original Battlefront sold about 14 million copies in its launch year, and the company expects similar performance from Battlefront II.
""Out aspirations are clearly to sell more,"" Jorgensen said. ""We think this will appeal to not just the broad Star Wars fan base, but also to the deep, heavily engaged Battlefield fan base and the Battlefront fan base.""
Although time will tell how Battlefront II ultimately does in the marketplace, I do think Jorgensen made a good point that Battlefront II will potentially appeal to the Battlefield 1 player base. Both Battlefront and Battlefield are first-person-shooter games, so the intersection of the sets of customers interested in each series is probably substantial -- something that could help boost Battlefront II sales.
Star Wars Battlefront II is expected to launch on Nov. 17, so by the time Electronic Arts' late January/early February earnings call rolls around, investors should have a reasonable idea of the title's reception in the marketplace.

Revenue jumped 17% year over year to $1.5 billion, driven by the continued success of Electronic Arts' Battlefield, FIFA, and Star Wars franchises.
Notably, EA's first-person shooter game Battlefield 1 has seen a 50% surge in players -- to more than 19 million -- compared to a previous version of the game. EA's soccer franchise is also enjoying strong growth, with more than 21 million players joining FIFA 17 through the end of fiscal 2017 and FIFA Ultimate Team players up 13% year over year. Additionally, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes user engagement continues to strengthen, with average gameplay time per player reaching a new high of 162 minutes per day in the fourth quarter.
Electronic Arts remains on the path toward full-scale digital distribution, with 61% of its fourth-quarter total net revenue coming from digital game sales, compared to 55% in fourth-quarter 2016. That helped gross margin increase to 86.8%, up from 82.7% in the prior-year period.
All told, net income fell 37% year over year to $566 million, or $1.81 per share, largely due to an income tax credit that boosted EA's fourth-quarter 2016 results. On a pre-tax basis, Electronic Arts' earnings rose 36% to $716 million.
Moreover, Electronic Arts' cash production remained strong, with fiscal 2017 full-year net cash provided by operating activities coming in at nearly $1.4 billion.
""We generated record net sales and operating cash flow in fiscal 2017, driven by our ongoing transition to digital as well as our increasing success with live services,"" CFO Blake Jorgensen said in a press release. ""Our long-term vision, to leverage deep player engagement to drive growth and profitability, is enabling us to execute on our near-term financial goals to increase revenue, earnings and cash generation.""
Electronic Arts expects revenue of approximately $1.425 billion in the first quarter, with net income of $605 million, or $1.93 per share.
EA also issued its fiscal 2018 full-year outlook, including:
""Fiscal 2017 was a milestone year for Electronic Arts, defined by groundbreaking games and live services that delivered more fun and connected more players with their friends,"" added CEO Andrew Wilson. ""In Fiscal 2018, we are focused on innovating for our players with extraordinary new experiences across our portfolio, continuing to grow our global network, and extending our reach across new platforms and more ways to play.""

            ","Wednesday was a mixed day for the stock market, with the Dow Jones Industrials losing ground while other major benchmarks inched slightly higher. Earnings took the spotlight among investors today, and three major Dow components reported lackluster results that helped pull the venerable average downward even as the broader stock market fared better. Some investors pointed to the Trump administration's decision to fire FBI director James Comey as a potential catalyst, but few seemed willing to draw conclusions about whether the move will make it more difficult for the president to achieve his domestic policy goals.
Still, some stocks climbed higher on good news, and Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), and Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Shares of Nuance rose nearly 8% after the company reported its fiscal second-quarter earnings Tuesday night and announcing a new strategic partnership with Lexmark Wednesday morning. In its report, Nuance saw revenue climb 5%, and the voice-recognition specialist saw bookings climb at a more-than-30% pace on strength in the enterprise segment. Upward adjustments to full-year fiscal 2017 guidance were also welcome. The Lexmark announcement also helped bolster confidence in the stock, as Nuance gave Lexmark rights to sell and distribute various Nuance products in exchange for the right to provide service and support to qualifying customers. For Nuance, the agreement bolsters its document-imaging business, and it sets the stage for other partnerships that could boost growth in the future.

Electronic Arts stock jumped 13% in the wake of the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings announcement Tuesday afternoon. The video game giant reported preliminary net revenue of $1.53 billion, of which more than three-fifths came from digital sources. Although net income for the quarter was down from the year-ago period, EA maintained its top position as the No. 1 publisher of games for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One consoles during its full 2017 fiscal year. With key wins in its Battlefield, Star Wars, and FIFA franchises, Electronic Arts believes that it's only beginning to see the full growth potential of its digital content. With net revenue expected to exceed $5 billion in fiscal 2018, EA is in position to set another high score in the year to come.
Finally, shares of Crocs surged 17%. The maker of footwear said that revenue fell 4%, but net income climbed by more than 12%, which was better than most investors had expected. Despite reducing its sales guidance for the full year to expect a slight decline, shareholders appeared to like Crocs' strategic plan to boost the value of the company's brand and its financial condition. In particular, Crocs said that it would transfer some of its stores in China and the Middle East to its distribution partners, and that's consistent with the company's desire to cut its store count and work with stronger distributors to help boost overall growth. Crocs has a long way to go to mount a full comeback, but its initial efforts look solid for now.

            ","Shares of video game giant Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) jumped as much as 15% in trading Wednesday after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. As of 12:51 p.m. EDT, the stock was up 14.3%. 
Revenue was up 16.7% in the quarter to $1.53 billion and net income fell 37% to $566 million, or $1.81 per share. The decline was largely attributable to an income tax credit in last year's quarter.

Results topped the $1.49 billion in revenue and earnings of just $1.63 per share that analysts had expected. For fiscal 2018, management forecast earnings of $3.57 per share, below the estimate of $4.16 from analysts, but that's not the focus for investors today. 
EA has made a solid transition to the new world of mobile games and digital downloads, getting $934 million of $1.53 billion in revenue from digital sources. The company's transition from dependence on hit games each year to a more consistent revenue model is giving investors confidence in the business's performance going forward. And with more and more people looking for ways to play games, whether it's on a smartphone or a new console, EA is well-positioned to offer compelling games that will be highly profitable for investors.

            ","E-sports has grown substantially in the past few years. Today, video game competitions draw thousands of players battling for a cash prize that sometimes numbers in the millions. According to analysts at NewZoo, the e-sports industry is estimated to generate around $700 million in 2017, and it's expected to continue growing quickly in the next few years. New content and new platforms have paved the way for this segment of the video game industry to be one of the fastest-growing, which has caught the eye of savvy investors. 
Of the many companies with a stake in the growing e-sports industry, the three that could be best-positioned for outsize growth in the next few years are Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and Take-Two Interactive.

Activision Blizzard is the maker of some of the world's most popular game franchises, including World of Warcraft and, more recently, Overwatch, which quickly became a worldwide hit after the game was released last May. Activision is now taking its market-leading position in video games and hoping to become the biggest name in e-sports as well. 
In early 2016, Activision acquired Major League Gaming (MLG), a platform that hosts competitive gaming tournaments and broadcasts them through MLG.tv. Shortly after acquring MLG, Activision announced its ""enhanced viewing experience"" for MLG.tv, which provides high-definition video streaming that also shows match statistics, instant leader boards, and insights on the competition that Activision management believes will help make MLG.tv the leader in e-sports broadcasting.

One interesting thing to watch from Activision Blizzard in 2017 is further development of the Overwatch competitive league announced last November. The company is planning to use this title to grow its professional-gaming outreach, including a sort of ""combine,"" similar to that of the NFL, that provides a path for amateur players to become high-paid full-time professional gamers within the league. In 2016, Activision doubled its prize pool across all hosted e-sports events to over $3.5 million, and that's likely to grow higher throughout 2017. 
In late 2015, EA announced a business division within its company dedicated to competitive gaming, and it has since grown its footprint in this space. One benefit for EA is that the company has a wealth of sporting games, which seem to lend themselves naturally to competitive gaming. The EA FIFA Interactive World Cup Championships is underway now, with the final world championship happening in late May. The tournament drew more than 2.3 million participants in 2016 and is likely to draw even bigger crowds this year. 
One particularly interesting part of EA's e-sports strategy to watch in 2017 is how the company continues to expand its competitive-gaming audience through traditional broadcast partners. In the company's fiscal Q3 earnings call in January, CEO Andrew Wilson noted that EA plans to also expand with ""new sponsors and broadcast partners, and original programming."" The company recently announced a partnership with ESPN (owned by Disney) to stream its FIFA Ultimate Team Championship Series in over 60 countries, while similar series for its Madden competitive-gaming tournaments will appear on NFL Network and Univision.  
Take-Two is a much smaller company by market cap than Activision and EA, but it's made a name for itself with popular franchises such as Grand Theft Auto. It could also be one of the biggest movers within e-sports this year following its February announcement that it has partnered with the NBA on a new e-sports league that will blur the lines of physical and digital sports.

Take-Two and the NBA will jointly run an e-sports league that allows NBA teams to run their own virtual teams, where NBA players can interact with video game players competing worldwide. The two organizations announced recently that NBA Senior Vice President Brendan Donohue has been appointed to oversee the e-sports league operations, and that NBA teams participating in the inaugural season will be announced in the coming weeks. They expect more than half of the league teams to participate. 
Speaking in the recent release regarding Donohue's appointment, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said, ""The league will have all of the structure and polish of the NBA, coupled with the thrills and engagement of our industry-leading NBA 2K franchise to provide an exciting new entry into the world of competitive gaming."" This new NBA e-sports league starts at the beginning of the 2018 NBA season, but we can expect more announcements about it throughout 2017 as it continues to develop.
While e-sports is certainly an exciting opportunity for new growth in the years ahead, it's only one small part of the overall gaming industry that itself is growing substantially, reaching a record $91 billion in 2016, according to SuperData. That's helped each of these companies' stocks to reach lifetime highs in recent weeks, and e-sports could be one more growth driver to help send those stocks even higher in 2017 and beyond.

            ","Over the last five years, the S&P 500 Index is up about 70%. This return is no match for Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) roughly 500% return over the same time period, but what can investors expect for the next five years? Will the stock continue to be a home run for shareholders?
We'll review how the stock delivered its massive run over the last five years, and what expectations investors should hold for the next five.
EA has fueled its run with in-game content sales from hit franchises like Battlefield. IMAGE SOURCE: ELECTRONIC ARTS INC. 
The video game industry has been undergoing a very profitable shift from physical sales of game discs to digital distribution, where players can purchase and download games directly through their consoles. This has been a common method of buying games for a long time with PC gamers, but it's just now catching on with console gamers. There has been no greater beneficiary of this business model shift than Electronic Arts.
In April 2012, EA had just wrapped up its fiscal 2012 year ending in March, where it reported $4.1 billion in net revenue and $0.23 in earnings per share. The company was in the middle of a major turnaround effort after reporting losses on the bottom line for several years. Management was aggressively pursuing higher-margin digital revenue sources, including mobile games and additional in-game content distributed directly to gamers via console, in order to position the company for long-term profitable growth.
The reason for EA's phenomenal stock performance cannot be explained by any new blockbuster games released, as the company is still producing the same hit titles, such as FIFA, Battlefield, and Mass Effect. Total revenue hasn't grown much, as EA is expected to report $4.8 billion in revenue for fiscal 2017, a cumulative increase of only 17% over fiscal 2012. 
The main reason for the stock's 500% gain is that digital revenue went from less than 30% of total revenue five years ago to 56% for the trailing-12-month period ending December 2016, as more gamers continued to purchase games, along with additional in-game content, directly through their consoles as opposed to buying physical game discs. This caused gross margin to expand from 61.4% in fiscal 2012 to an expected 72.1% for fiscal 2017.
The increase in gross profit dropped all the way to the bottom line as EA is expected to report $3.83 in earnings per share for fiscal 2017, a compound annual growth rate of 75% since fiscal 2012. In April 2012, EA stock traded for about $15.50 per share, and the trailing-12-month PE ratio was 67 -- expensive by conventional standards. However, the high valuation was a sign that investors were expecting rapid growth in earnings as management pursued its turnaround strategy -- and EA delivered, big time.

EA data by YCharts.
Since the company is further down the line in building out its digital revenue channels across mobile games and direct buying through consoles, I expect EA to grow its earnings, but nowhere near 75% per year over the next five years. Here's why investors should lower their expectations.
1. Slowing digital revenue growth: Although digital revenue is still growing fast, at 18% over the trailing-12-month period, this is way down from the 47% growth rate EA was posting five years ago, when the company was just getting the ball rolling on its digital revenue opportunities.
2. Moderating earnings growth: Stemming from slower digital revenue growth, the last three years have shown a moderating growth rate in earnings per share. EA's fiscal 2017 expected earnings should show 21% year-over-year growth (assuming the company reports $3.83 for full-year earnings per share), which is down from the previous year's 30% growth rate.
IMAGE SOURCE: Electronic Arts. 
EA's 21% growth rate for fiscal 2017 was based on a year when the company released a new Battlefield version, one of its best-selling games. For fiscal 2018, the company will be releasing a new Star Wars: Battlefront game, which produces lower margins than Battlefield because of the cost of the licensed content EA pays to Walt Disney's Lucasfilm subsidiary. As a result, analysts are expecting EA's earnings growth to slow to 8% in fiscal 2018, with growth through the next five years expected to average 16.5% per year.
I expect physical sales of games will continue to slowly decline, digital revenue will continue growing around 15% per year or faster, and gross margin will continue to gradually expand over the next five years as digital revenue becomes a greater percentage of total revenue.
While I wouldn't expect the stock to return anything close to 500% by 2022, I think analyst estimates of mid-teen level growth are very reasonable, and with the stock trading for 22 times fiscal 2018 expected earnings, investors are arguably getting a good deal.

The video game industry is one of the largest forms of entertainment in the world, with annual revenue of $100 billion and growing. People spend as much time playing video games as they do on Netflix or social media.
Among the top-selling games in history, you will find all the major game publishers represented -- Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO). 
Here are the top seven best-selling franchises of all-time:

Electronic Arts' action racing franchise Need for Speed has had its ups and downs over the years. While the most recent version released in 2015 marked one of the lower points, longtime fans of the Fast and Furious-style racing game more likely savor Hot Pursuit in 2010 or High Stakes in 1999 as their favorite installment in the series. 
Despite most versions of the game receiving mediocre reviews, the franchise has still managed to sell 150 million units since its first release in 1994. Look for EA's next entry in the series by early 2018.

Also published by Electronic Arts, the classic social simulation game The Sims has sold 175 million copies since 2000. Recent releases seem to have taken a downhill slide, which caused EA to shut down the studio responsible for creating the franchise. However, development of The Sims will continue. EA recently hinted that the next installment -- The Sims 5 -- will include virtual reality capabilities, which could create a new level of interest in the popular franchise.

Take-Two Interactive has struck gold with the massively popular Grand Theft Auto franchise. It is very difficult across the entertainment industry to produce sequels that earn great reviews, whether it's a video game or a movie sequel.
However, developer Rockstar Games has proven to have an uncanny ability to produce new versions of Grand Theft Auto that consistently draw high praise from critics. Each new version ends up as one of the best games for each console generation.
Grand Theft Auto V has sold 75 million copies since its 2013 release, and still ranks as one of the top-selling console games after four years, which is phenomenal. Since the first Grand Theft Auto game released in 1997, all versions of the franchise combined have sold an impressive 240 million copies.

Given the popularity of the first-person shooter genre, it's not surprising to see Call of Duty rank somewhere on this list.
First released in 2003, the Call of Duty series has sold 250 million units. The latest installment's science-fiction setting disappointed fans of the franchise, but it still managed to outsell competitor Battlefield 1 from EA, which means even when Call of Duty is off its game, gamers still buy it.

The Pokemon Company was started in 1998 by a joint investment of three companies, one of which was Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY). The Pokemon brand originated as a video game, but today it spans comics, animated movies, TV shows, merchandise, events, and official shops. The video game series has sold 280 million units life-to-date.

The classic puzzle game Tetris was designed by Alexey Pajitnov while working for the Computer Center of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1984. The name Tetris comes from the Greek word ""tetra"" (meaning ""four"") and ""tennis,"" Pajitnov's favorite sport. The game was immediately popular in the Soviet Union and took off globally in the late 1980s, after the game was showcased at the 1988 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. After 495 million units sold, the game comes in as the second-best-selling video game of all time.

Many of today's adult gamers were likely introduced to video games with the classic Mario game on the original Nintendo console in the late 1980s. Chances are if you missed Frogger on the Atari, you found Mario on Nintendo as one of your earliest and best gaming memories. Since the introduction of the Mario character in 1981, the franchise has sold 528.5 million copies.
And Mario is not done. With the new Nintendo Switch expected to sell up to 20 million units in its first year after launch, there will be plenty of pent-up demand for the next generation of gamers to be introduced to Mario in the upcoming Super Mario Odyssey this holiday shopping season.

            ","When Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, May 9, the first item investors should check is how well Mass Effect: Andromeda sold during March (which fell in the fourth quarter) and how sales are faring in the current quarter. Management should give analysts on the conference call an update on the game's sales performance because of high anticipation leading up to the game's release and its very weak review scores since then.
If Mass Effect: Andromeda had lower sales than management anticipated, the financial results for the quarter that ended in March could be disappointing.
IMAGE SOURCE: ELECTRONIC ARTS INC. 
Mass Effect: Andromeda is the fourth installment following the initial trilogy of games released from 2007 to 2012. While the first three in the series were well-received, Andromeda has, surprisingly, gotten mediocre reviews at best. The game didn't break any new ground over the original trilogy, disappointing fans who were expecting something new, especially given that this marked the debut of Mass Effect on more powerful, current-generation consoles.
But even more bothering than the lack of novelty is that Electronic Arts seems to have rushed the game to market to get the game out by the end of its fiscal fourth quarter. Some reviewers have reported that the game has glitches in facial animations and inconsistent frame-rate performance in game play.
Problems like these are nothing major in the long run. Game companies typically use software updates or offer patches directly to gamers over consoles or PCs to fix performance issues with game play. EA has been listening to feedback and is expected to correct these problems in the coming months. Still, the damage could be done in terms of short-term sales of the game.
On top of technical problems, Mass Effect: Andromeda was up against a surprisingly strong lineup of new games in the first three months of the year. Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, released in March along with the new Switch console, has been a strong seller and received outstanding reviews. Ubisoft Entertainment's Ghost Recon: Wildlands was a surprise hit, with a debut at No. 1 on the sales charts in March, according to NPD Group.
Yet even with all the challenges, Mass Effect: Andromeda still managed to rank among the top five best-selling games for March. According to NPD's numbers, Mass Effect: Andromeda made its debut at No. 3 on the list of top 10 games for March. For year-to-date sales through March, Andromeda is the No. 5 best-selling game.
However, it's possible Mass Effect: Andromeda could be further down the best-sellers list when we take into account digital sales of games. The sales numbers for Andromeda include both physical disc sales and fully downloaded digital sales directly over PC and console. However, the two games below it on the sales chart -- Horizon: Zero Dawn and MLB The Show 17 -- don't include digital sales, which means it's possible Mass Effect: Andromeda may be as low as the No. 5 best-selling title for March.
Either way, based on the hype leading up to its March release, Mass Effect: Andromeda should have been No. 1 or No. 2 on the sales charts. With the game sitting on the sales charts at No. 3 or lower, it appears the game is not selling quite as well as many had expected.
Electronic Arts is coming off a holiday quarter in which digital sales from full-game downloads, extra in-game content, subscriptions, and mobile games grew 36% year over year to $1.1 billion. FIFA 17's Ultimate Team digital card game, and newly released in-game content for Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, should have been key contributors to digital sales in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Analysts expect EA to report $1.09 billion in total revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, an 18% increase year over year. As for earnings per share, analysts expect the company to report $0.75, representing a 50% increase over 2016's fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue from Battlefield 1 and Mass Effect were expected to be the key drivers going into the quarter. If Mass Effect: Andromeda performed lower than management's expectations, EA will need strong performance from in-game digital content sales from Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, and FIFA 17 to make up for it.

            ","NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) graphic cards have long been favorites among hardcore gamers, but who would've thought the chipmaker's stock would explode the way it has in recent times? The share price has more than tripled in just the past year, turning NVIDIA into a near eight-bagger in just five years. Of course, there's more to its run than just graphics processors. It's more an artificial intelligence computing company today, having made huge headway in two of the hottest technology fields of our times: AI and self-driving cars.
For investors looking to find the ""next NVIDIA,"" the trick is to find a company that is sitting on a big growth opportunity, or is already tapping into a soon-to-heat-up trend, but that is still flying under Wall Street's radar. These are stocks with the potential to soar.
If you're already drooling at the thought, check out why our contributors think Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), and A.O. Smith Corp. (NYSE:AOS) have NVIDIA-like growth potential.
Rich Smith (Electronic Arts): NVIDIA stock has gained roughly 500% in price over the past three years.  Finding a stock that can match that growth rate over the next three won't be easy -- but I know a good place to start.
According to the venerable Warren Buffett, patron saint of value investors, ""In the short term, the market is a popularity contest. In the long term, the market is a weighing machine.""
What that tells me is that NVIDIA's strong price performance was more than likely a function of its strong business performance -- and indeed, checking the history on S&P Global Market Intelligence, we find that at the same time NVIDIA enjoyed its growth spurt, it was also growing its profits -- up 23% annually, on average, over the past five years.
Image source: Getty Images.
So how do I find stocks with similar potential for their prices to soar? By screening for businesses that have grown their earnings as fast as -- or faster than -- NVIDIA has. When I ran one such screen recently, the name that really jumped out at me was Electronic Arts, a company that, like NVIDIA, has its roots in the gaming industry.
Over the past five years, Electronic Arts has grown its earnings 17-fold -- even faster than NVIDIA's three-fold increase over the same time period. As a result, Electronic Arts now sports a market capitalization only 22 times its booming earnings. That's actually half the P/E of NVIDIA, despite the fact that Electronic Arts has grown at a faster clip.
What's more, analysts who follow these stocks project that Electronic Arts will keep growing earnings at 15% annually over the next five years -- versus only a 10% growth rate for NVIDIA. If that's how things play out, Electronic Arts stock could very well soar more in the next few years than NVIDIA has in the past few.
Reuben Gregg Brewer (International Business Machines): I'm a ""slow and steady wins the race"" kind of guy, so NVIDIA is way too ""racy"" for me. Especially when you notice that the big gains it has racked up are mostly compressed into 2016. International Business Machines is more my speed; its ""soaring"" could be spread over a longer period of time.   
While IBM's legacy businesses have been shrinking, it has been using its ample cash flow to pay dividends, buy back shares, and, most important, invest in reinventing itself. It's done this several times over its more than 100-year life. Today, that means building up areas like cloud and cognitive computing while getting rid of older businesses. The result is falling revenue, but hidden underneath that overall decline is significant growth in the businesses that will drive IBM's future. Revenue from its ""strategic imperatives"" grew 13% in 2016, and now provide 41% of total revenue. There's plenty of room for them to keep growing.   
What everyone is waiting for, meanwhile, is the day when the strategic imperatives start to drive total revenue higher. That moment looks increasingly close at hand and, I believe, will push the stock price higher. Sure, with a 14 price-to-earnings ratio and a 3.1% dividend yield, IBM looks more like a value stock than a growth stock. And because of its size, it will probably never see percentage revenue gains like NVIDIA did in the third and fourth quarters of its just-completed fiscal year. But I believe it's only a matter of time before IBM starts growing again, with slow and steady gains spread over many years, not compressed into one. 
Neha Chamaria (A.O. Smith Corp.): Don't we all love hot showers in the winter? Thank water heaters. But you wouldn't expect a water heater and boiler manufacturer's business to be too lucrative, would you? Well, A.O. Smith Corp. proves otherwise. Double-digit percentage growth in earnings and free cash flow in the past five years? Check. Double-digit return on equity and return on investment? Check. Low leverage? Check.
OK, let's stop here, because these kinds of statistics are almost all we need to spot a stock than can meet or beat NVIDIA's crazy run.
A.O. Smith dominates the North American water-heater industry, with market-leading shares in both the residential and commercial markets. The company's popular brands, including Lochinvar, Aquasana, and its namesake brand, have made it far and wide thanks to its wide distribution network, and tie-ups with retail chains like Lowe's. 
Image source: Getty Images
While replacement demand drives A.O. Smith's North American sales, China's booming middle class is proving to be its biggest growth card. China now accounts for nearly one-third of its revenue, with sales from the region growing at a compounded rate of 22% over the past decade. A recent industry analysis report by Global Market Insights forecasts that the electric-water-heater market in the Asia-Pacific region will grow at a compounded rate of 10.7% through 2024. A.O. Smith should be among the top beneficiaries, given its presence in China and recent entry into India. 
Analysts expect A.O. Smith's EPS will grow roughly 12% annually in the next five years, but the company could easily crush those estimates given its torrid pace of growth in China. Add in its dividends -- A.O. Smith has increased its dividend for 12consecutive years -- and the stock could very well be a multibagger in the long run.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO), and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock prices have soared in recent years, driven by the shift to digital distribution of games and content.
The growth of mobile gaming, the emergence of e-sports, and digital distribution of games are allowing game companies to expand margins and expand the global audience for gaming.
Faster internet connections and online-enabled consoles have been game-changers for video game publishers. Physical sales of games in retail stores are dwindling as gamers choose to download games directly to their console. This new business model of selling digital games and content is performing wonders for game companies' bottom line.
The video game industry is $100 billion and growing. Image source: Pixabay. 
While full-game downloading has been around on PC for several years, it's just now catching on as a mainstream form of purchasing games on consoles like Sony's PS4 or Microsoft's Xbox One. As a result, game publishers are drowning in cash as the need for physical game discs is diminishing and is being replaced with high-margin downloadable content directly distributed to gamers over consoles.
Electronic Art's stock price is up over 400% in the past five years as its gross margin has expanded from 63.4% in fiscal 2013 to an expected 72.1% for fiscal 2017 ending in March. EA's cash generated from operations has grown from $324 million in fiscal 2013 to $1.37 billion for the trailing-12-month period. The improvement in profitability stems from growing digital sales of content, including full-game downloading on consoles, sales of additional in-game content, and the growth of mobile games.

EA data by YCharts.
Further margin expansion is expected since only 32% of EA's unit sales on current-generation consoles are digitally downloaded rather than purchased physically in-store. This parallels Take-Two's 25%-plus current-generation titles purchased digitally. 
As margins and profits expand, game companies are finding other attractive growth areas within the industry to allocate excess cash to drive future growth.
According to SuperData Research, mobile gaming generated $40.6 billion in worldwide revenue in 2016 and grew 18% over 2015.
The top three game publishers are beginning to allocate capital into mobile gaming as a way to diversify revenue channels and benefit from the fast growth of the mobile market.
Activision Blizzard made a bold move when it bought King Digital Entertainment for $5.9 billion in early 2016. The addition of the Candy Crush and Bubble Witch developer helped Activision Blizzard increase cash flow from $1.26 billion in 2015 to $2.16 billion in 2016.
Recently, Take-Two announced the acquisition of mobile game developer Social Point for $250 million. Social Point's revenue has grown 29% per year since 2013 and the company generated $19.9 million in operating income for 2016. Take-Two expects to generate $350 million in cash flow for fiscal 2017 ending in March.
EA has put together a portfolio of mobile game studios over the years, giving it access to popular games like Plants vs. Zombies, in addition to mobile versions of its own console franchises. EA's trailing-12-month mobile revenue increased 14% year over year to $626 million.
Perhaps the biggest opportunity facing game companies today is the global phenomenon of competitive gaming, or e-sports.
Newzoo estimates the global e-sports audience to be 385 million, with e-sports spectators totaling 194 million with the balance being active participants. The number of participants is expected to grow 50% to 286 million by 2020, bringing the total audience to nearly 500 million.
The large global audience is a great opportunity for game companies to reach new audiences by designing games with compelling multiplayer competitive game modes. Activision Blizzard, for example, designed Overwatch to specifically appeal to the global e-sports audience. Sports games like EA's FIFA and Madden NFL, as well as Take-Two's NBA 2K are perfect for e-sports as well.
The e-sports market has been around for several years, but game companies are only now beginning to actively pursue it as another revenue channel. 
The bright prospects for the video game industry is also attracting outsiders like Amazon.com, Facebook, and Alphabet to join the action. Facebook has its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset.  Amazon and Alphabet offer game developers cloud storage solutions to host mobile games and both are also competing in live game streaming. Amazon has even embarked on a journey of developing games with Amazon Game Studios.
These tech giants have clearly noticed the growing audience for e-sports and the high engagement levels demonstrated by gamers.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, Activision Blizzard players spent about 43 billion hours engaged with the brand's various game titles. This number is in line with other major entertainment/social media outlets like Netflix. It shows how video games have become a major form of entertainment which bodes well for the industry's future.

            ","Of the forces that could drive the future of the video game industry, including new consoles and virtual reality, one especially interesting opportunity lies in e-sports. Some of the industry's biggest players are racing to establish themselves in this space, but exactly how viable are video games as a spectator sport?
E-sports -- also called competitive gaming or pro gaming -- closely resemble more traditional sports in that participants compete to earn salaries and cash prizes but in multiplayer video games such as League of Legends and World of Warcraft. Events are typically organized through e-sports organizations, and they can happen online or in actual arenas with all of the hype one would expect at a major sporting event.

In the 2016 international Dota 2 competition held in Seattle, thousands of people came out to watch teams of gamers compete for over $20 million in cash prizes. An estimated 385 million viewers will tune into e-sports competitions in 2017, and that's expected to grow rapidly in the coming years.
According to analysts at Newzoo, the e-sports industry is expected to bring in about $700 million of revenue this year, growing to more than $1.5 billion by 2020.  
Much of the value for e-sports comes from broadcasting and advertising opportunities, and media companies like ESPN are lining up to take part. YouTube Gaming was recently launched as a platform for streaming e-sports, and Amazon.com acquired Twitch.tv last year, a video streaming site known for competitive gaming content. 
The leading video game companies -- Activision Blizzand (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) -- each have their own broadcasting platforms as well. But for the time being, the greatest value of e-sports is in deeper player engagement and the ability to sell more titles as this sport continues to grow. 
Activision Blizzard is now the parent company of Major League Gaming, following an early 2016 acquisition that Activision management said was part of their goal to create ""the ESPN of e-sports"". CEO Bobby Kotick said in the earnings call following the acquisition, ""We think competitive gaming and the spectator opportunities connected to organized gaming competitions could provide sizable opportunities for shareholders, and great rewards and recognition for our hundreds of millions of players."" 
Image source: Major League Gaming / Activision Blizzard.
In the most recent earnings call, management said they have expanded existing leagues and have also announced a competitive league around the popular Overwatch game that launched in 2016. This year, Activision will begin ""selling teams and commercializing media rights for the Overwatch League.""
""Millions of fans were drawn to the action with the 2016 season delivering 120 million video views,"" said Activision COO Thomas Tippl, ""and more than twice the time spent viewing compared to last year's season. We look forward to plenty more action in the months to come.""
For Electronic Arts, enthusiasm for e-sports is similar. The brand has developed its own competitive gaming segment that has various levels from premier (entry) to EA Majors, which are large-scale live e-sports events hosted by the company. For the recent EA Major Madden Classic live event, the company said that 1.5 million fans played during the qualifying rounds before the live championship in Los Angeles. 
So far, EA has focused on sports-based titles for competitive gaming, which makes sense given their popular franchises like FIFA and Madden. However, the company is also engaging through other kinds of fantasy and first-person shooter games like Battlefield. In the most recent earnings call, CEO Andrew Wilson said, ""Our focus for EA's Competitive Gaming Division is to grow engagement in some of our biggest global franchises. With strong results to date, we will now expand EA Competitive Gaming even further in FY 2018, fueled by more competitions, new sponsors and broadcast partners, and original programming.""
Of course, these aren't the only companies looking to capitalize on this trend. Take-Two Interactive is a much smaller gaming company by market cap but one of the fast-growing names in e-sports to watch. The company has partnered with the NBA as part of its NBA 2K e-league and in 2018, will begin hosting competitive gaming competitions that mimic the actual NBA season. 
Compared to the broad video game market, valued at about $100 billion globally, e-sports is still a small slice of the pie. But as growth in the video game industry moderates, as Newzoo analysts expect to happen in the next few years, even an early stage opportunity like e-sports could have the massive potential that companies like Activision and Electronic Arts will tap to continue outperforming the market for years to come.

            ","Everyone loves a good growth story when it involves share-price growth to the tune of 200% or more in just a few years. The following three stocks have at least tripled and remind us that growth can come from unexpected places. 
Based in Colorado, Vail Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:MTN) has turned itself into the juggernaut of the skiing world, not just in the nearby Rocky Mountains, but also increasingly across North America and the world. Vail Resorts recently acquired Whistler Ski Resort near Vancouver, Canada, and is now the parent company of 11 resorts in North America and one in Australia. Vail also announced recently that it intends to buy Stowe Mountain Resort in northern Vermont next. 
Vail stock has tripled since June 2013, largely because of the growth the company has seen through acquisitions. However, another way the company has been able to consistently grow sales is through various season pass programs that give skiers and snowboards more time at more mountains, but also bring more consistent and higher sales than if Vail Resort counted only on individual lift ticket sales. More resorts under the Vail umbrella make the multi-mountain season passes even more attractive, which should help in continuing to drive those average prices higher.   
In the most recent quarter, Vail Resorts' fiscal Q2, the company beat analyst expectations with sales over $725 million, up more than 20% year over year, while net income grew nearly 37%. Management also updated its full-year guidance to the upper end of its previous range and raised its dividend 30%.

Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) seems an unlikely candidate for such market-beating returns in a time when many restaurant companies are in decline. Yet its stock has tripled since September 2013. One of the initiatives that has led to Domino's success in the past few years is its focus on tech, specifically through online and mobile ordering, even text-message ordering, which has helped to set the company apart in its industry. 
Domino's domestic same-store sales grew more than 10% in 2016 year over year, and international comps grew 6.3%. The fourth quarter marked the 23rd consecutive quarter that both U.S. and international same-store sales were up. The brand continues to expand its footprint and now has nearly 14,000 company-owned or franchised locations globally.
Store count grew by a record 1,281 during the past year, and those were outside the United States by a 7-to-1 margin. In the 2016 year-end earnings call, CEO Patrick Doyle said that ""Around the world, on average, we opened a new Domino's store every seven hours in 2016, which is an amazing thing to consider.

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is one of the most important names in the gaming industry, developing some of the most popular games on the market, including the FIFA and Star Wars franchises. The company has benefited from a changing industry where internet-connected consoles and mobile gaming make it easier to deliver content to gamers digitally, which boosts gross margin and earnings, and also allows for in-game purchases that drive higher sales from each consumer. Digital sales now make up 60% of the company's total.
As a result of those more profitable operations, and the company's well-received content, EA's calendar-year 2016 sales grew around 8%, year over year, but net income doubled. The company's success has helped EA's stock to triple just since April 2014, and much of that growth has come just in the past year, as the company continues to prove its ability to deliver hit games and drive that success to its bottom line.
Going forward, EA has a few interesting areas of growth that could continue driving the stock's results, such as a focus on e-sports, which plays on its dominance already in the sports video game genre and adds a level of real-life competition between players. In addition, EA's stock still looks relatively cheap compared with its competitors, meaning there could be more room for shares to trend higher as the company's success carries on. 
EA, Domino's, and Vail Resorts don't have much in common in terms of industries, but what they do have in common is an ability to find growth both through market expansion and smart operational efficiencies. Each of these companies could be poised for continued market-beating results going forward.

            ","Competitive gaming, or e-sports, is expected to cross $1 billion in revenue by the end of 2018, according to SuperData Research. E-sports is not profitable yet, and is still a relatively small market by revenue ($893 million estimated in 2016), but it's growing fast and promises to be a great marketing tool for video game companies to drive higher sales and engagement with certain franchise titles.
Competitive gaming is big business. IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY. 
The nature of competitive gaming used to be nothing more than two buddies sitting on a couch battling it out over a match of Mario Kart or Street Fighter. Today, fast internet connections and advancements in graphics technology have created the perfect environment for players from around the world to hook up online over a game console or PC.
The interesting thing is that there are at least as many people who like to watch others play games as there are game participants. Newzoo says the global e-sports audience will hit 385 million this year. This is why e-sports has attracted the attention of companies outside the video game industry to sponsor tournaments.
It's also why Amazon.com spent nearly $1 billion to acquire the game-streaming site Twitch in 2014. The competitive nature of some video games, like Riot Games' League of Legends, can fill entire arenas with spectators who want to watch a small group compete at the highest level for cash prizes that can reach into the millions.
In its 385 million audience count, Newzoo puts the number of ""occasional viewers"" at 194 million, slightly more than the 191 million who are estimated to be ""enthusiasts."" Newzoo expects the number of enthusiasts to grow 50%, to 286 million, by 2020.
The three major game publishers -- Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) -- all have an interest in increasing the audience for games. Publishers see the growing global audience for e-sports as the perfect opportunity to market games to entirely new audiences, as well as increase interest for particular titles among active gamers.

ATVI data by YCharts.
The benefit to investors in video game companies is the prospect for significant growth in engagement with the franchises, especially those games designed with competitive gaming in mind. It's no coincidence that the most competitive games, like Activision's Call of Duty, also generate a lot of profit through in-game content sold to players directly over PC and console. For perspective, in-game content revenue was 55% of Activision Blizzard's total revenue for 2016.
Activision Blizzard created its new franchise, Overwatch, ""to be the definitive competitive game,"" according to the CEO during the third-quarter conference call in November. CEO Bobby Kotick said on the February recent conference call, ""Our ambition is to create nothing less than the e-sports equivalent of the world's established major professional leagues."" (Transcript via Seeking Alpha.)
The game has been a tremendous success, registering 25 million players as of the most recent quarter. Depending on the level of interest in the upcoming Overwatch League, there could be an increase in Overwatch player registrations and higher sales of in-game content.
Other publishers are getting in on the action, as well. The NBA and Take-Two recently teamed up to start the NBA 2K eLeague. Take-Two's NBA 2K franchise has sold more than 60 million units since its debut in 1999. Along with EA's FIFA and Madden franchises, NBA 2K is one of the most popular sports franchises available.
Electronic Arts created its Competitive Gaming Division to oversee e-sports events for its Battlefield, Madden, and FIFA franchises. EA plans to expand the division even further in fiscal 2018. CEO Andrew Wilson said on a recent conference call, transcript via Seeking Alpha: ""Our focus for EA's Competitive Gaming Division is to grow engagement in some of our biggest global franchises. With strong results to date, we will now expand EA Competitive Gaming even further in FY 2018, fueled by more competitions, new sponsors and broadcast partners and original programming.""
At this early stage in its development, e-sports is not profitable because the revenue derived from advertising, tickets, merchandise, etc. is being reinvested in the e-sports economy.  Right now, the main interest in e-sports for publishers is to reach new audiences and drive higher interest in games. 
However, investors should pay attention to developments with Activision Blizzard's Overwatch League. CEO Bobby Kotick is a great businessman and there can be little doubt he wants Overwatch League to be a profitable business in the long run for shareholders.
In the long run, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and Take-Two stand to benefit the most as these companies design games targeting competitive gamers and start professional gaming leagues to capitalize on the growing popularity of e-sports.

            ","EA has a strong game portfolio to drive growth over the long term. Image source: Electronic Arts. 
Over the last 12 months, Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) stock is up over 30% as the video game publisher has seen strong growth in game sales of its FIFA and Battlefield franchises. To top off good sales results, gross margin has been expanding as the gaming industry continues shifting to a digital distribution model.
Here are five important quotes from management on Electronic Arts' most recent earnings conference call.
At the end of the fiscal year, our BioWare studio will be delivering an all-new [intellectual property], a clean-sheet design with new concepts, new gameplay mechanics, and new stories set in a unique new universe. This game has the potential to fundamentally disrupt the way people think about an action title, bringing friends together to play in an exhilarating new way. We're very excited about the future of this new franchise and its ability to attract a large global audience.
-- Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson
Over time, it's important to keep the pipeline strong, so it was encouraging that management has another franchise in the works. The description sounds very similar to Activision Blizzard's Destiny, which has become one of seven $1 billion franchises for the EA rival. Game publishers are laser focused on increasing the audience for each game. Designing quality games that have an engaging multiplayer component has become the key ingredient to accomplishing this.
Our eSports competitions for players at all levels have led to dramatic increases in engagement among competitive players. Through Q3, FIFA 17 competitors were playing nearly three times more than the rest of the FIFA community.  We expect the excitement will continue as we add more competitions, more broadcasts and more content in the year ahead.
-- Wilson
In addition to game design, e-sports is proving to be a great marketing tool to attract a larger global audience for each game.  EA's FIFA competitions are a great example of this. FIFA e-sports competitions are stirring more interest in the game as competing players spend more time with the game than non-competitors.  
E-sports is a fast-growing segment of the gaming industry with the global e-sports audience expected to reach 385 million in 2017, according to Newzoo's latest report. The more people playing a game, the greater opportunity the game publisher has to monetize the game with additional in-game content. 
We are building our mobile games today to have a long life with players through outstanding live services and dynamic content updates.
-- Wilson
EA has a great portfolio of mobile games such as Plants vs. Zombies, as well as mobile versions of console titles FIFA and Madden NFL. According to management, EA was the most downloaded mobile games publisher in the world during the quarter.
Along with e-sports, mobile games are proving to be a great opportunity for game publishers to reach larger audiences.  
The mobile game market is an attractive way for game publishers to extend reach to a casual gaming audience that may not own a video game console. It's also a fast-growing market. SuperData Research estimates that the mobile game market generated $40.6 billion in revenue in 2016, representing growth of 18% over 2015.
The time people spend playing mobile games is also estimated to be greater than the time spent on popular streaming services like Netflix. According to Business Insider, most of the U.S. population has played a mobile game in 2016, which means mobile gaming could become as important to Electronic Arts and other publishers as console games.
The unique player base of Battlefield 1 is more than 50% larger than that of Battlefield 4 [the previous iteration] in its comparable launch quarter, with more than one-third of the players being new to the franchise or new to EA.
-- Wilson
Battlefield plays second fiddle to Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty, but the growth of Battlefield's player base year over year shows how a rising tide is lifting all boats in the video game industry. With a larger Battlefield player base, EA has a great opportunity to drive higher revenue from in-game content in the coming year. EA generated $1.2 billion in extra in-game content for the trailing-12-month period. This was an increase of 14% year over year.
In the coming months, EA will release more in-game content for Battlefield through additional maps, armies, and other content to keep player engagement up.
Gross margin for the quarter was 55.1%, up 6.1 percentage points over last year. The gross margin for our underlying business continues to grow, driven by product mix and the shift to digital.
-- Electronic Arts CFO Blake Jorgensen
In-game content is also contributing to EA's expansion in gross margin, which is expected to be 72.1% for fiscal 2017 ending this month.
Another trend impacting gross margin is the growth of full games downloading direct to consoles. For several years this has been a mainstream form of purchasing games on PCs, but it is just beginning to build momentum with console gamers.
EA reported that 32% of unit sales on current-generation consoles -- Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One -- are directly purchased and downloaded by gamers on console. For the trailing-12-month period, EA generated $666 million from full-game downloads, which grew 38% year over year.

EA data by YCharts.
Also, Ultimate Team has been a popular feature for players of FIFA and Madden. Players purchase in-game digital card packs for as low $0.99 to put together a dream team. The feature is very addictive for diehard FIFA fans due to the remote odds of drawing one of the world's top soccer players to use in competitive games with other players.
Ultimate Team is also growing into a big business for EA.  Over the second and third fiscal quarters, FIFA 17 Ultimate Team revenue increased 30% over FIFA 16 (excluding the effects of currency exchange rates).
At a recent Morgan Stanley conference, EA CFO Blake Jorgensen mentioned that Ultimate Team generated $800 million in revenue over the last year, which is an increase over the $650 million figure he disclosed in early 2016.
As with all in-game digital content, the revenue for Ultimate Team carries very high margin, and EA executives are already thinking of ways to bring the feature to other franchises like Star Wars Battlefront and Battlefield.

            ","Investors interested in the video game industry should find both Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) appealing. Both are expanding margins as digital revenue opportunities from in-game content and mobile gaming continue to propel the industry forward.
Read on to find out more about what both companies are doing to keep the good times rolling.
EA's Mass Effect: Andromeda is a major short term catalyst. IMAGE SOURCE: ELECTRONIC ARTS INC. 
Growing revenue from mobile games, in-game content, and full game direct downloads via consoles has fueled a rapid rise in Electronic Arts' digital revenue from $1.4 billion to an expected $2.8 billion for fiscal 2017 ending in March.  As packaged goods revenue from physical game sales remains flat, digital revenue growth has been fueling Electronic Arts' growth in profits.
This has been an industrywide trend that is likely here to stay as players have come to expect downloadable content to be a given when they purchase a game. The additional content is relatively inexpensive, and it stretches the longevity of a title -- something very valuable to gamers.
Total revenue is expected to be $4.8 billion by the time Electronic Arts reports its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results. This would represent 9.1% growth over fiscal 2016. The higher margin from digital revenue is expected to generate $1.35 billion in operating cash flow for fiscal 2017.
Along with its competitors, Electronic Arts is building a diversified portfolio of revenue channels from advertising, subscriptions, mobile games, and eSports to lessen its dependence on physical game sales.
Looking further out, EA has a strong short-term catalyst in the new science fiction action game Mass Effect: Andromeda, releasing in March 2017. Later in the year, in time for the holiday season, EA will release a new Star Wars Battlefront game, which promises to be bigger and better than the previous version of the game.
Also, in the last earnings release, there was mention of a new franchise that has the potential ""to fundamentally disrupt the way people think about an action title, bringing friends together to play in exhilarating new ways.""
This game has been designed to ""attract a global audience,"" a quality Activision Blizzard has been aiming for in its recent titles like Destiny and Overwatch.  Designing games this way is becoming commonplace as game companies target the large, fast-growing global audience for eSports.
Game publishers are in a race to create the biggest audience. The emergence of eSports, advertising, consumer products, media rights, and mobile gaming have opened up opportunities to smooth out the volatility of single-game hits, which companies relied on in the past.
Take-Two has a major catalyst in the upcoming Red Dead Redemption 2 game. IMAGE SOURCE: TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE INC. 
The same trends benefiting Electronic Arts are opening the door for Take-Two to free itself from the dependency of its best-selling franchise, Grand Theft Auto.
At the beginning of February 2017, Take-Two announced the acquisition of mobile game developer Social Point for $250 million. This is a small transaction relative to Take-Two's market value of nearly $6 billion, but it's an important sign for investors that Take-Two management is pushing the company further into the profitable, fast-growing market of mobile game publishing.
Excluding Social Point, Take-Two has been successful with the mobile version of its best-selling console franchise, NBA 2K. The latest installment in the basketball series -- NBA 2K17 -- is one of the top-grossing games in Apple's app store at the time of this writing. A deeper push into mobile gaming with strategic acquisitions like Social Point will help Take-Two build a consistent, growing revenue stream.
Fiscal Year
Annual Cash From Operations
Data sources: Take-Two annual reports and fiscal third-quarter 2017 earnings report. 
In recent years, Take-Two has been growing its digital revenue from in-game content like virtual currency for NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online. As with Electronic Arts, the Grand Theft Auto maker is seeing more players download games directly over consoles, which represented more than 25% of Take-Two's current generation console titles purchased digitally in the last year. Since the game publisher doesn't have to hold a lot of inventory for physical copies of games, full game downloading is much more profitable for the gaming companies.
Overall, Take-Two expects to report $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year 2017, ending in March. For cash flow, the company expects to generate $350 million, an increase over $261 million in fiscal 2016.
As for short-term catalysts, Take-Two's sequel to the original Red Dead Redemption is coming in fall 2017. The highly anticipated western action game is not expected to sell anything close to the phenomenal 75 million copies of Grand Theft Auto V, but it should sell at least as well as the first Red Dead Redemption's 14 million.  
Another future growth driver is the NBA and Take-Two's recent announcement to create an eSports league built around the NBA 2K franchise.
Strong tailwinds are affecting the video game industry right now, but not every company is made equally. Each of the three major publishers -- Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and Take-Two -- have their own twist on strategy.
Between Electronic Arts and Take-Two, I favor Electronic Arts for its higher cash generation, its mobile game portfolio, and its presence in eSports with its Competitive Gaming Division. But I expect that, over time, Take-Two will catch up to its rivals in broadening its revenue diversity, so this really isn't the edge for Electronic Arts it seems to be today.

EA data by YCharts.
On valuation, Electronic Arts sells for about 20 times expected earnings and cash flow. Take-Two's valuation is 20.7 times expected earnings and 16.6 times expected cash flow. Because Take-Two is much smaller revenue-wise than Electronic Arts, investors who are looking for higher growth potential should consider Take-Two.

According to Newzoo's latest research, e-sports revenue will reach $696 million in 2017, an increase of 41.3% over 2016. These estimates are based on revenue generated from advertising, sponsorship, merchandise, ticket sales, and game publisher fees.
Large audiences at e-sports events around the world are drawing attention from major brands. By 2020, Newzoo expects revenue to double to $1.5 billion driven by brand investment. Coca-Cola sponsors the most popular e-sports tournament -- League of Legends -- which has drawn large audiences numbering in the tens of millions, rivaling the NBA Finals. Coca-Cola also partnered with select cinema partners to allow fans to view live e-sports events across more than 200 theaters around the United States, Europe, and Canada.
Other brands that have made an investment in e-sports as an advertiser or sponsor include Buffalo Wild Wings, Berkshire Hathaway's Geico, and Red Bull.
Buffalo Wild Wings is joining Arby's and Credit Karma as sponsors of ELEAGUE -- an e-sports league based on the console and PC game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Buffalo Wild Wings' investment is significant in that its success has been largely built on its involvement with televised sporting events. It's a clear sign that e-sports is emerging as a major sport on the same playing field as traditional leagues.
Buffalo Wild Wings Vice President of North America Marketing Bob Ruhland said, ""We're always exploring emerging platforms to engage with passionate sports fans.""
He added, ""We're excited to partner with ELEAGUE as the popularity of eSports grows, and we'll continue to identify new ways for our Guests to enjoy an immersive sports experience in our restaurants.""
Also, Walt Disney Co's ESPN recently announced an agreement with Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) EA Competitive Gaming Division to broadcast a live e-sports event in the United States. ESPN is already starting to cover e-sports with the same rigor as traditional sports. It has a section of its website devoted to e-sports news coverage.
ESPN will also include EA's FIFA Ultimate Team Championship Series across ESPN2, ESPN Deportes, and ESPN3 channels. Portada reported, John Lasker, VP of programming and acquisitions, ESPN discussing the matter:
We're expanding our competitive gaming portfolio to include events that also resonate with traditional sports fans, and EA's FIFA Ultimate Team Championship Series fits perfectly into how we intend to continue to serve eSports fans moving forward...The opportunity to reach this passionate audience globally in multiple languages is exciting, and we are pleased to do so as part of our long-standing relationship with EA.
Right now, e-sports is not a profitable market. Revenues are growing, but everything is reinvested back in to the e-sport economy. Still, game publishers and brands want to invest in e-sports because of the opportunity to reach a massive audience that is growing every year.
With estimates suggesting that the global e-sports audience will reach 385 million in 2017. Out of this audience, 191 million are estimated to be participants and 194 million spectators -- with the number of spectators expected to grow another 50% by 2020.
An important number highlighted in the Newzoo report is average revenue per fan, which is used by traditional sport leagues to measure how well a sport is monetized. This is estimated to be $3.64 in 2017 but is expected to increase to $5.20 by 2020. While this is significantly less than traditional sport leagues, that high rate of growth that is attracting attention from major brands.
Skeptics point out while a major e-sports championship can draw as many as 40 million like League of Legends, there are not many e-sports events like this throughout the year, making the comparison to major sport leagues invalid.  
On a revenue basis, e-sports is not on the same level as the $5.9 billion value of all 30 teams in the NBA, for example. However, we're in the baby stages of sector. The NFL and NBA have been around for decades. As more e-sports leagues are started in the future, and the sport begins to form the structure of a major professional league, there is the long-term potential for the value of e-sports to reach into the billions. E-sports has the audience, and game publishers are now starting to test ways of monetizing that audience.
Until now, many e-sports events have been isolated championship tournaments. E-sports hasn't had long regular seasons spread over several months like traditional sports leagues because there hasn't been the financial backing to structure a league with a long regular season and playoff.
But now we are starting to see game publishers step up with that commitment. Two important new leagues to watch are Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) Overwatch League and Take-Two Interactive Software's (NASDAQ:TTWO) NBA 2K eLeague. Activision Blizzard will soon start selling teams for Overwatch League to prospective owners this year, and the NBA and Take-Two just announced the formation of its own professional e-sports league based on the best-selling NBA 2K franchise.
The interest for game publishers is the same as big brands. Publishers see the opportunity to scale up game titles on a global level and expand the audience for a particular franchise. In fact, Activision Blizzard designed Overwatch specifically for the purpose of competitive gaming, and the popularity of Call of Duty is based primarily on the nature of its competitive online multiplayer game mode.
While e-sports may be a long way off from being a significant contributor to the bottom line, it is a great marketing tool for game companies to build a bigger audience for game franchises.

            ","For decades, video games have brought joy to countless children around the world. And with more adults playing games in recent years, the industry has become truly massive in its size and scope.
The statistics that follow will help to give you a sense of the awesome scale of the global video-game market.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. There are more than 2 billion video game players worldwide, according to market intelligence company Newzoo.
2. Here in the United States, 63% of households have at least one person who plays video games regularly (3 hours or more per week), while 48% of U.S. households own a dedicated game console, according to the Entertainment Software Association.
3. And its not just kids who are playing these games; the average game player age is 35 years old.
4. In fact, while 27% of game players are under 18, 26% are 50 years old -- or older.
5. As for gender, 59% of game players are male, while 41% are female.
6. In stark contrast to the image of an isolated gamer locked away in a dark basement for hours on end, gaming appears to have a significant social element to it; 53% of the most frequent game players say video games help them connect with friends, and 42% feel video games help them spend time with family.
7. Moreover, the most frequent gamers who play multiplayer and online games spend an average of 6.5 hours per week playing with others online, and 4.6 hours per week playing with others in person.
8. In a sign that the industry has won increased parental approval, 68% of parents say video games are a positive part of their child's life, and 62% of parents whose children are gamers play computer and video games with their children at least weekly.
9. There appear to be benefits to video game playing in addition to just having fun. Of the most frequent gamers, 75% believe playing video games provides mental stimulation or education. This coincides with a study by Yale University that showed that students who played a brain-training video game for 20 minutes three times a week for four months performed better on reading and math tests than their peers who did not.
10. These perceived benefits are likely contributing to the growth of the U.S. video game industry, which saw video game software sales rise 6% to $24.5 billion in 2016, according to the ESA.
11. On a global basis, the video game market reached $99.6 billion in revenue in 2016, up 8.5% compared to 2015, according to Newzoo.
12. China, which, like the U.S., accounts for nearly a quarter of all global game revenues, is expected to approach $29 billion in game revenue by 2019, up from $24.4 billion in 2016.
13. Newzoo estimates that mobile gaming generated 37% of total global video-game revenue in 2016, rising 21.3% year over year and surpassing PC revenue for the first time ever.
14. Still, PC and console-based gaming remain vital components of the video-game market, with each segment comprising more than $31 billion in sales in 2016, according to Newzoo.
15. To date, Sony (NYSE:SNE) has dominated the console wars, with sales of its PlayStation 4 recently surpassing 53 million units worldwide. That's more than double the estimated 26 million Xbox One units Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has sold, and triple the 15 million Wii U units sold by Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY), according to research company SuperData.
16. That's a valuable position for Sony -- and to a lesser extent, Microsoft -- to hold, as consoles are increasingly becoming an entertainment hub, with 50% of people who own game consoles using them to watch movies, 28% using them to listen to music, and 21% using consoles to consume live and other content, according to the ESA.
17. Notably, the growth in gaming appears to be coming at the expense of other forms of entertainment. In particular, gamers who are playing more video games than they did three years ago are spending less time playing board games (49% of gamers), watching TV (37%), and going to the movies (37%).
18. Virtual reality appears to have a bright future within gaming, as 58% of the most frequent gamers who are familiar with virtual reality intend to play games on VR, and 40% say they will likely purchase VR within the next year, according to the ESA.
19. An even more powerful growth driver for the gaming industry is the emergence of eSports. The global audience for eSports surged 36.6% to 323 million in 2016, and Newzoo projects that it will exceed 589 million worldwide by 2020.
20. Global revenue in the eSports industry rose an even more impressive 51.7%, to $493 million, in 2016 -- and is expected to approach $1.5 billion by 2020.
21. All told, Newzoo forecasts that the global video game market will exceed $118 billion in total revenue by 2019.
The growing attraction of gaming among people of nearly all ages and the surging popularity of eSports are propelling the already $100 billion video-game industry to ever-rising heights.
While some are attempting to profit from this trend by buying stock in console makers such as Sony or Microsoft, investors may be best served by instead purchasing shares of the top video game makers, such as Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).
Activision makes some of the most popular eSports games, including Heroes of the Storm, Call of Duty, StarCraft, and WarCraft, while Electronic Arts is owner of two of the most popular sports-based eSports franchises in Madden and FIFA.
While console makers often struggle with razor-thin margins, video-game makers are benefiting from the trend toward digital distribution, which is boosting margins and overall profits for both Electronic Arts and Activision.
Perhaps most importantly, Activision and EA are video-game pure plays, while Microsoft and Sony are much more diversified businesses. As such, investments in Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts are a direct way to profit from the growth of the global video-game market -- a bet I expect will pay off handsomely in the years ahead.

            ","Video-game stocks have seen a lot of growth lately, but the gaming industry could still give publicly traded gaming companies such as Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) even more room to run. With the growth of online gaming, mobile gaming, and new hardware and software that's preparing a tech overhaul for this industry, here's why EA and these other companies could be some of the best video-game stocks now.  
The gaming industry itself looks to be continuing to grow nicely, up to $91 billion in 2016, according to analysts at SuperData, and is expected to continue growing in the years to come. There are multiple growth drivers pushing the market up, one of which is the growth in online gaming, not only via computers but also gaming consoles seamlessly connected to the internet.

The behemoths in this space, Activision and EA, continue to look like two of the best gaming stocks, as they consistently put out top content and pivot toward the future of video games. The rise of online gaming and internet-connect consoles has helped traditional console gaming content makers such as Activision and EA to sell more games that can be downloaded digitally, and also help to push more in-game purchases.
Activision shares jumped nearly 20% the day after 2016 full-year earnings were announced on Feb. 10, when the company reported sales up 42% in 2016 year over year. The company also announced plans to use its excess cash to buy back $1 billion in stock over the next two years. With rising total monthly active users, as well as increased user engagement and monetization from its top-performing franchises, the company looks to have plenty of room to run from here.  
EA has also been a top content creator in the industry with its highly successful FIFA, Star Wars, and Battlefield franchises. EA is one of the most important players in the growing e-sports segment, which could be a major growth driver with its already popular games. While EA's sales haven't been growing as quickly as Activision's -- EA's sales rose 7.4% for the first nine months of 2016 year over year -- it still looks to be on a long-term growth trajectory with rising earnings, up 56% during that same time. The stock also looks cheaper by price to earnings than most of its competitors.  
Speaking of reasonable valuation for plenty of expected growth ahead, another gaming stock that looks especially interesting now is NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES). This Chinese internet media company, among many other offerings, gives users online games both of its own and through distribution partnerships with companies such as Activision. NetEase has released many new games in 2016, helping its sales continue to grow nicely as a result, and the company said it would continue its drumbeat of new games in 2017. Even with rising sales and earnings, both of which rose by double digits in the most recent quarter year over year, the stock looks cheap now at just 18 times forward earnings.  
Another growth driver for the gaming industry has been the rise in mobile gaming, particularly with low-feature games that drive huge initial demand, as well as increasingly sophisticated games with more storylines and longer-term engagement. Not every company fighting for the mobile-game market has done well lately, but one standout in this space is Take-Two Interactive. The company recently acquired Social Point, a free-to-play mobile game developer, which should help Take-Two continue growing in this space.

Take-Two also upped its own game in e-sports with a new partnership with the NBA as part of Take-Two's NBA2K e-league game. Take-Two's earnings have yet to catch up to the company's growing stock price as a result of its investments in new growth, hence the seemingly absurdly high price-to-earnings ratio, but the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21 looks reasonable. 
Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) is another interesting gaming company, and one that made a big splash throughout 2016 following the release of game developer Niantic Inc.'s Pokemon Go in partnership with Nintendo. The augmented-reality game took the world by storm, getting over half a billion downloads in the first few months on the market. 
The following release of Nintendo's Super Mario Run mobile game was less well received, and the company missed sales and earnings estimates in its most recent quarter, but Nintendo hopes to continue making headlines with its new console, called Switch, that comes out in early 2017. Nintendo's stock does look expensive now for its limited recent history of consistent hits, but the company still has a lot of intellectual-property assets, and its more aggressive mobile strategy could make for more big hits in the near future.  
The gaming industry is not only growing but also constantly evolving, and there are many players in this space set to benefit both directly and indirectly -- such as computer companies that make consoles, and chip companies that power the technological growth of this space. The future of gaming looks rosy and these look like some of the best gaming stocks you could own now.

            ","Both Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) are benefiting from the growth in full-game downloading, sales of in-game content, and mobile gaming. These sources of revenue are allowing video game publishers to keep inventory and in-store marketing costs down, and this allows more revenue to flow to the bottom line.
The outcome is that both businesses have shown dramatic improvements in profitability in recent years. But which is the better buy today?

In the last five years, Electronic Arts has successfully turned itself around from a business struggling to breakeven to one of the most profitable businesses in the industry with over $1 billion in net income. The stock has rocketed over 300% since 2012 as a result.

EA data by YCharts
From fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2016, EA's revenue from physical sales of games for both console and PC has declined from $2.3 billion to $2 billion. At the same time, digital revenue has grown from $1.4 billion to $2.4 billion. Because Electronic Arts doesn't have to hold inventory to sell digital copies of games and other content, all of this incremental revenue from digital sources flows straight to the bottom line. 
Electronic Arts has been successful in porting over best-selling EA Sports franchises -- Madden and FIFA -- from consoles to mobile platforms. Other top 100 selling mobile games owned by Electronic Arts are Plants vs. Zombies, The Sims, and BioWare's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Further technological advances in smartphones and tablets will continue to provide a tailwind for EA's mobile gaming business.
With respect to EA's console business, digital revenue on a trailing 12 month basis increased 21% year over year to $1.365 billion as of the most recent quarter. Electronic Arts is growing its console business with annual releases of hit franchises Battlefield, Madden, and FIFA. The highly anticipated release of the science-fiction action game, Mass Effect: Andromeda, is a major catalyst in the short term with a March 2017 release.
Other avenues of potential growth are emerging as the company recently formed a separate division to pursue the opportunity of eSports, which is expected to be a $1.23 billion market by 2019.

Activision Blizzard is also pursuing eSports with Overwatch League, which is well positioned to be the most valuable competitive tournament in the world. Activision appears to be more aggressive in going after eSports in the same way Electronic Arts was more aggressive in pursuing mobile gaming.
As mobile opened up new business models for game publishers in the categories of free-to-play games and in-game purchases, the growing interest in competitive gaming will open up new opportunities in advertising and licensing -- not to mention additional brand awareness to certain game franchises.
Activision has also been beating Electronic Arts in the most popular gaming genre, first person shooters. According to VGChartz, Battlefield was the second best-selling first person shooter in the holiday quarter. The king of shooters is Activision's Call of Duty, which was the top selling console franchise in 2016.
It is a significant testimony to the Call of Duty brand considering that the November 2016 release of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare received inferior reviews compared to Battlefield 1, released about the same time. Likewise for previous iterations of both franchises. Activision Blizzard has seven franchises with revenue of $1 billion or more. This strong portfolio of games helped Activision generate $1.3 billion in net revenue in the third quarter, an increase of 43% year over year excluding the acquisition of King Entertainment. Almost $1 billion was in-game content sales. Activision expects to report $6.5 billion in revenue for the full year 2016, of which about 75% will be derived from digital sources.
A few years back, it seemed the Call of Duty developer was lagging the mobile gaming trend as Electronic Arts was making a much more assertive effort there. Activision took a major leap forward with the purchase of King Entertainment -- the maker of the popular mobile game Candy Crush -- which contributed $459 million to Activision's third quarter revenue.
The King acquisition, along with the 2008 merger with Blizzard Entertainment, is the reason why Activision is the largest and most diversified video game publisher. These acquisitions highlight the advantage Activision has had with consistent leadership at the helm, something Electronic Arts hasn't had the luxury of.
Going forward, Electronic Arts is in a better position to make acquisitions of its own, and perhaps duplicate the moves Activision is making in competitive gaming, advertising, and subscription business models.
That aside, Activision has been successful in finding ways to keep bringing players back to long running franchises by steadily releasing new game versions, in-game content, and expansion packs. New franchises, such as Destiny and Overwatch, and the emergence of new growth opportunities should allow Activision to continue its lead as the top game publisher.
On top of the diversity of Activision's intellectual property portfolio, it offers slightly better value with a price-to-earnings ratio of 19 compared to 20 for Electronic Arts. Plus, Activision shareholders get a small annual dividend yield of 0.66% compared to no dividend with Electronic Arts.
For these reasons, Activision Blizzard is the better buy.

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) reported fiscal 2017 third-quarter financial results on Jan. 31. The video game maker saw its sales boosted by strong recent game releases, while improving margins helped to shrink losses.
Data source: Electronic Arts Q3 2017 earnings press release.
Revenue rose 7% year over year to $1.15 billion, driven by strong sales of Electronic Arts' FIFA, Battlefield, and Star Wars franchises.
Impressively, Electronic Arts said that its FIFA 17 soccer game was the best-selling console title in the world in 2016. Battlefield 1 is also off to a strong start, with a player base that's more than 50% larger than that of a previous version of the game in its comparable launch quarter. And Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes is enjoying solid user engagement, with average gameplay time per player reaching a new high of 155 minutes per day in the third quarter.
Electronic Arts continues to transition toward higher-margin digital distribution of its games, with 60% of its third-quarter total net revenue coming from digital sales, compared to 53% in Q3 2016. That helped gross margin increase to 55.1%, up from 49% in the year-ago quarter.
All told, net loss narrowed to $1 million from $45 million in the prior-year quarter.
Moreover, Electronic Arts strengthened its cash generation, with net cash provided by operating activities coming in at a record $1.115 billion. 
""For the first time ever, we generated over $1 billion in operating cash flow in a quarter,"" said CFO Blake Jorgensen in a press release. ""This is a true testament to the innovation we built into Battlefield 1 and FIFA 17 and the continued strength of our digital live services.""
Electronic Arts expects revenue of approximately $1.482 billion in the fourth quarter, with net income of $513 million, or $1.64 per share.
""With the top console games and most-downloaded mobile portfolio in the industry for Q3, Electronic Arts is growing, engaging and exciting a global community of players,"" said CEO Andrew Wilson. ""We will continue to push the boundaries of play, with stunning new titles like Mass Effect: Andromeda, global competitive gaming tournaments and more amazing experiences coming in the year ahead.""

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) will report its fiscal third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Jan. 31, and the biggest trend to watch for is the continued growth of digital revenue as a percentage of total revenue.
Continued growth in full-game downloads, mobile games, and extra content has helped EA grow digital revenue and expand its gross margin from 63% in fiscal 2013 to an expected 71% for fiscal 2017, which ends at the end of March. In fiscal 2016, EA's revenue totaled $4.6 billion, of which $2.5 billion -- 54% of the total -- was digital. Digital revenue is expected to be 57% of total revenue for fiscal 2017.
With almost every passing quarter, digital revenue should continue to grow relative to total revenue as more players download games directly to their consoles, and as management continues to invest in online subscription services, like EA Access and Origin Access, that allow players to download as many games as they want for a fee.
Battlefield and Titanfall are two popular franchises that had new releases in October; they should be solid contributors to EA's fiscal third-quarter revenue. EA's strategy is to release a new version of these games every few years, and fill in the time between with extra content, such as maps and weapons, that players download to enhance the gaming experience. Since we won't see another Battlefield for at least a few years, quality downloadable content for players in the coming year will be very important to grow revenue. 
EA's Battlefield 1 faced stiff competition from Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare in the just-completed quarter. Activision already claimed victory by announcing that its new installment of the very popular Call of Duty franchise was the top-selling console game as of Dec. 15, but EA's first-person shooter wasn't too far behind. Battlefield 1's player base in the first week after launch was nearly double that of its predecessor title -- Battlefield 4 -- released in 2013, according to management.
While Battlefield 1 is expected to turn in solid sales numbers, it will be interesting how management characterizes results for Titanfall 2. Some analysts were concerned that releasing a new Battlefield and a new Titanfall game in the same month would cannibalize sales. This might have been a legitimate concern, as Titanfall 2 hasn't sold nearly as well as Battlefield 1, despite receiving good reviews.
In addition to first-person shooters, EA Sports' FIFA and Madden franchises are very important to holiday sales performance. FIFA 17 was released around the end of the previous quarter. The popular soccer game series in recent years has made up up 15% to 16% of EA's annual revenue. The new FIFA introduced a story mode called The Journey, which allows players to take control of a rising international soccer star. This new feature helped spurred FIFA 17 to outpace sales of FIFA 16 by 13% within the first month after release. Nearly two-thirds of all FIFA 17 players had engaged with The Journey, the company reported in early November. Expect the franchise to be a strong driver of fiscal third-quarter results.
As for EA's popular NFL franchise, players spent more time with Madden NFL 17 after its release in fiscal Q2 than any other version of the franchise in the last five years, according to management. Engagement with Madden's Ultimate Team card game increased 20% year over year.
The holiday quarter is a big quarter for the Madden franchise as it coincides with the end of the NFL regular season and the beginning of the playoffs, creating extra excitement for players to engage with the game.
Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield are all expected to help EA reach $2.03 billion in total revenue for the third quarter compared to last year's $1.8 billion. Management has guided for a net loss of $53 million, or $0.17 per share, as the company invests in new franchises, as well as EA's development efforts with respect to digital content and subscription-based services.
Wall Street likes to focus on earnings per share, but the best way to measure the profitability of a video game business is its free cash flow -- expected to be $1.2 billion for the full year, thanks to expanding margins from growth in digital revenue. Management expects the holiday quarter to be the video game makers' biggest cash flow quarter ever.
Last, but not least, the highly anticipated Mass Effect: Andromeda is expected to release in March. The sci-fi shooter will be a strong contributor to sales in the next few quarters, and possibly the game of the year for 2017. Management may provide color about what they are seeing in preorders, and their overall expectations for the game's sales.

With a packed release schedule, 2017 is bound to see a number of big video game releases wind up as financial casualties. January has already seen the cancellation of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) long-in-development Xbox One exclusive Scalebound, and the company's remaining lineup for the year will likely see other high-profile titles disappoint. It's not the only company with big, upcoming games that are in danger of underperforming: Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) also have key software on the horizon that could go down in flames.

Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) Battlefield franchise will be taking a bit of a breather before its next installment, with management indicating that a sequel is at least two years away from release. The series' 2016 entry Battlefield 1 landed to great reviews and strong sales, and EA has delivered an entry in the property on a roughly annual basis, so word that a follow-up is farther out than usual points to a shift for the company.
The fact that a sequel to the company's Star Wars Battlefront, also a first-person-shooter, will be debuting in 2017 likely has a lot to do with the time-out for the Battlefield series, but the move might also be a reaction to a changing industry climate.
EA and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) have long favored annualized installments for some of their biggest properties, and that schedule will remain the norm for sports games and certain other franchises, but a more staggered release schedule could become standard for many of gaming's core series. 2016 saw an abnormally high number of big budget games post disappointing sales, and a crowded market was likely a contributing factor. Activision's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare reportedly sold somewhere around 50% less than the previous year's installment, EA's Titanfall 2 came up far short of expectations, and Ubisoft's Watch Dogs 2 sold poorly enough to make the viability of future entries questionable.
The first-person shooter genre is especially crowded at the moment, with other franchises including Destiny, Overwatch, Doom, and a long list of smaller properties all vying for the attention of the same core demographic. Releasing a new series entry every year is one way to keep a user base engaged, so long as publishers can keep up with the demands of delivering must-have experiences, but saturation can diminish the specialness of a franchise and speed its decline.
While EA, Activision, and Ubisoft have favored yearly releases for many of their most important series, Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) has taken the opposite approach with its marquee property Grand Theft Auto -- and to great effect. Five years passed between the release of Grand Theft Auto IV and the company's 2013 megahit Grand Theft Auto V, and the long development cycle enabled the company to ensure that the product was close to perfection upon release. A high level of quality control and attention to detail helped to make the game the series' best-selling installment ever, with roughly 70 million units shipped as of November, and paved the way for ongoing online engagement that has been hugely profitable for the company.
With game budgets climbing, the ability to increase a product's lifecycle through a combination of a strong core experience and downloadable content expansions can have a much bigger payoff than releasing annual sequels. This type of strategy is also employed by the Blizzard wing of Activision Blizzard, and it's a move that could have a big long-term payoff for Electronic Arts. Battlefield is one of the company's few blockbuster properties that does not depend on a license, so making sure that the franchise doesn't burn out and lose its specialness has added importance.
Battlefield doesn't need to take the five-year development route employed for Grand theft Auto, but the series' quality would almost certainly benefit from longer development cycles, and that could go a long way to keeping players engaged and encourage spending on virtual currency and downloadable content. With Battlefield 1 being generally regarded as a high-quality product and the game's World War I setting giving it a notable point of distinction in comparison to competition in the genre, the game could be well-suited to transitioning the series to a different release model. Downloadable content expansions are already on the way, with the first update scheduled for release in March and additional major updates likely to follow.
EA generates roughly $1.3 billion a year from the sale of downloadable content expansions, with roughly half of that coming from its Ultimate Team card games for the FIFA and Madden series, and comments indicate that the company is working on a similar addition to Battlefield. If Electronic Arts can keep users engaged through updates and successfully introduce a digital card game component to the series' model, investors should welcome the move to space out future releases in the franchise.

Shares of game maker Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) jumped 14.6% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, as the game market in general recovered. After years of fretting over how mobile devices would change the console gaming industry, investors are finding that EA is going to have a bigger market to play in with both console and mobile markets. 
A strong earnings year was really what helped the stock, and digital sales were a real highlight. Over the trailing twelve months ended after fiscal Q2 2017, digital sales were up 12% to $2.6 billion, driven by 21% growth in console digital sales and 17% growth in mobile.

EA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
Rather than being a negative for revenue and earnings, the expansion of internet gaming and content has helped EA find new avenues for growth. Digital downloads and other services have become a big business, and they're helping improve margins, which are expected to rise to 71% in fiscal 2017 from 63.4% in fiscal 2013. And the operational improvement is something investors were very happy about in 2016. 
EA is in a great position in gaming today as a leader in both console and mobile games. And there will be further opportunities for management to monetize the business as the installed base of both consoles and mobile devices proliferates. I don't see growth in either segment stopping, and that should lead to further growth. 
Shares are expensive at 22 times trailing earnings, but given the tailwinds in the game industry I think the stock still has room to have a great year in 2017.

According to analysts at SuperData, 2016 has been the best year yet for video games, with the total market value hitting $91 billion this year. Driving this growth is exciting new technology and expanding platforms bringing in new gamers worldwide. 
Gaming stocks have had quite a year as well, with some of the biggest names in the industry underperforming, such as Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and some companies out of left field rising to the top, such as Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY). Looking to the year ahead, here are the top gaming stocks to buy now. 
By far the biggest story of 2016 has been mobile gaming, led in large part by the cult-like following for Pokemon Go. This augmented-reality game has started the whole industry thinking of new ways to serve content to gamers. Pokemon Go, created by Niantic Labs in partnership with Nintendo, has helped Nintendo's stock to surge as much as 80% before a mid-December sell-off that resulted from a less-favorable launch of Nintendo's attempt at follow-up success with Super Mario Run.

Another exciting technology shift in 2016 has been the increased focus on virtual reality (VR), led in large part by Sony (NYSE:SNE) and its new VR gaming bundle for the PlayStation 4 console. VR has been somewhat of a pipe dream, as high costs and limited content has made it a novel concept but without mass-market appeal. Sony's new VR equipment, along with new VR-specific games, could change that situation. 
For the year to come, it's important to recognize which companies performed especially well in 2016, but also to look at what these companies are doing now, along with their valuations, in an attempt to decide which are in the position to growth the most this year.

While 2016 hasn't been a big year for Activision Blizzard shares, it has been a transitional year in which it has expanded its footprint in mobile, including a changing business model to more digital in-game purchases and subscription revenue. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has gone on a similar journey that should continue to pay off in 2017. These two companies consistently make up many of the top games in the industry, and now that their stocks have come down in valuation (especially true for Activision, which in months past was trading above 45 times earnings), 2017 could prove to be a year in which their stock prices see impressive gains.

NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) is one of the best plays on the thriving Chinese gaming market. This Chinese internet services company offers online gaming packs and also partners with companies such as Activision Blizzard to distribute many of their games throughout China. NetEase recently announced a slew of new PC and mobile games, 29 in total, and has promised to continue releasing new games in 2017. By valuation, NetEase is also the cheapest company on the list despite its great showing in 2016. 
One of the best performing stocks in the game content space in 2016, Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO), could certainly keep its momentum going in 2017 with fresh new content and an increased focus on digital and mobile growth. Take-Two's sales rose 21% in the most recent quarter, year over year, though its growth strategy has left earnings still relatively low, which is the cause of its absurdly high P/E ratio. Still, its forward P/E is just 19, and the company seems in a great position for continued long-term growth.

This past year has shown the importance of the behind-the-scenes power generators -- such as graphics-chip makers -- that are benefiting from the rise in the gaming industry. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an example of a company that has made some of the exciting growth in things like VR possible. Gaming makes up only part of this company's total revenue, so it's not a pure play on gaming growth like Activision Blizzard, but its success in this industry made it a top gaming stock of 2016, pushing its stock up 220% during the year. 
Going into 2017, NVIDIA continues to look like a best bet on the gaming industry growth, especially as one of the prime makers of VR-ready laptops and some of the important gaming hardware in the market. Apart from gaming, NVIDIA's growth in connected cars, artificial intelligence, and data centers make it a top stock for some of the most exciting tech around.
Two other things to watch in 2017 are the new gaming consoles expected to launch at Nintendo and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Switch is meant to be a hybrid between a console and portable gaming system and will replace Nintendo's older systems like the Wii. Microsoft's ""Project Scorpio"" console won't be released until late 2017, and very little has been released about its specifications, but it's almost certainly going to include some VR components.
While these two consoles look like wild cards in the gaming industry in 2017, the growth of the industry itself looks solid going into this year.

With 2016 drawing to a close, the technology sector has been the year's strongest performer, with the SPDR XLK Technology Sector ETF -- which tracks tech stocks -- delivering 11.4% returns while the broader S&P 500 index is up roughly 8% across the stretch. That's even more impressive because tech companies make up the largest component of the index and have been the biggest force behind its gains year-to-date. This doesn't necessarily mean that tech stocks will continue to outperform the market in years to come, but they do fit into a broader trend that suggests owning the right ones can have outsized benefits for your portfolio.
To help investors close out 2016 on a good note that carries into the coming year and beyond, we asked three Motley Fool tech writers to profile a stock that deserves your attention this December. Read on to learn why they selected Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) as stocks worth buying now.
Chris Neiger: Qualcomm has been a bit of a disappointment over the past two years for long-term investors. The company's stock is down more than 6% over the past 24 months and even with strong gains this year it still hasn't hit its previous highs of mid-2014. 
But Qualcomm is showing signs of life. The company just posted solid fourth-quarter growth, with GAAP revenue increasing 13% year-over-year and net income jumping 51%. The company's core business, licensing, saw revenue grow by 6% from the same time a year ago and its CDMA technologies business rose by 14% year-over-year. 
That was all good news and it came on top of the company's growing its earnings per share by 60% year-over-year, mainly due to increases in licensing agreements in China and strong chipset shipments. 
But one of the more exciting aspects of Qualcomm right now is the company's pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors. NXP has the leading market share position in the automotive semiconductor space and soon that advantage will be Qualcomm's. This will not only bring new automotive semiconductor revenue to the company, but could also help Qualcomm sell more of its cellular connectivity chips to customers as it builds out more automotive relationships. 
Qualcomm's solid growth in its core businesses, along with its pending purchase of NXP should help the company continue to gain from the mobile market while expanding further into automotive semiconductors. And that's great news for Qualcomm as the automotive semiconductor market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% through 2020.  
The company's stock trades at about 14 times its forward earnings, which is far below the tech industry P/E average of 25 , making Qualcomm an even more tempting proposition right now.
Rich Duprey: There's little doubt Electronic Arts is having a good year. Titles such as FIFA and Madden NFL are pushing its sports division higher while its latest combat-oriented ones like the Battlefield franchise are off to a strong start. Equally important has been its mobile segment. Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes helped advance sales 21% in the third quarter.
Those have helped drive EA's stock 18% higher in 2016, outpacing the advance of tech stocks in general. But as December starts off, don't discount the game maker's ability to rise further because all those gains don't necessarily mean its success has been baked in.
As the leading publisher on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, Wall Street seems to have a higher opinion of Electronic Arts' future than it does itself. Whereas management is guiding current year revenues to $4.77 billion, the consensus view of analysts is that it will actually come in around $4.95 billion. The company also seems to be lowballing its third-quarter estimates.
Yet CEO Andrew Wilson also believes the game publisher is in an excellent position, noting on its conference call with analysts that ""we are in an outstanding position for the quarter ahead, with two of the highest-rated games of this console generation in Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, global competitive gaming tournaments under way, and our first virtual reality experiences coming soon.""
It's that latter realm where EA may see its biggest growth spurt yet. According to a report by SuperData Research, publishers like EA are staring at a potential audience of almost 56 million VR users who will push sales of VR hardware, software, and accessories over $5 billion in 2016. That's a near-tenfold increase from the $550 million spent on such equipment last year, and estimates launch it into the stratosphere by 2018 when some $12.3 billion is expected to be spent.
Game development is where most of the investments in virtual reality are being made, accounting for 60% of the total, and as EA maneuvers across this new landscape it will get more than its fair share of real estate. For the coming holiday season it will have Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-wing VR Mission for PlayStation VR and Need for Speed No Limits on Daydream, which is Google's VR platform.
It's also investing in more mobile content and in streaming, which should leave Electronic Arts covering all the bases and primed to continue its growth journey next year.
Keith Noonan:  Verizon is facing fierce competition in the wireless carrier space, but the company is diversifying through acquisitions and restructuring to take advantage of momentum in the Internet of Things. I think it stands a strong chance of finding success in these efforts and growing over the long term.
Big improvements in network speed and data capacity are needed to accommodate the machine-to-machine communication boom, and Verizon is leading the push. The company has partnered with Cisco, Intel, and Ericsson for the development of a 5G mobile router that could be a breakthrough technology in the broader connectivity revolution. The company' expects its 5G network to deliver 1 gigabyte per second downloads when it launches -- roughly 200 times faster than standard 4G LTE speeds, and Verizon is also building out its ThingSpace platform-as-a-service for IoT and beefing up  ad-delivery and video technologies for connected devices. It's also got the largest connected vehicle fleet under its wing thanks to its purchase of Fleetmatics and Telogis.
Verizon stock has a forward P/E of roughly 14.5, and, with a dividend payout yielding 4.6%, it looks like an inexpensive stock backed by returned income that will provide insulation in the event of growing pains or a market downturn. Share performance could face pressure due to declining wireless subscriptions, but a price that presents a reasonable entry point to long-term ownership, a great dividend, and potential to benefit from the Internet of Things make it a stock to buy this December.

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) released a new title in its Battlefield video game series in late October, and initial sales are so far exceeding those of past Battlefield titles. But with EA's stock still near all-time highs, the strong sales growth will need to continue to justify more share price appreciation. Here's what lies ahead during the important holiday shopping season.
Image source: Electronic Arts.
Gamers continue to be enthralled with war-themed shootouts. Sales are rocketing even though the latest Battlefield 1 title comes on the heels of series releases nearly every year since 2002 from EA.
When the company released its last quarter's business results on Nov. 1, included in the data was a line item showing that Battlefield 1's first-week user base was double that of Battlefield 4's, the last successful installment in the franchise. One report compiled independently of EA shows the new title also outsold its last two predecessors combined upon release.
This is great news for Electronic Arts and its investors. The chart-topping sales of its new shooter ousted another EA title from the No. 1-selling slot, FIFA 17. The soccer video game had been the best-selling console game since early October.
What this means for investors is that EA is set to have a very busy winter season, capping off a very busy 2016. The last quarter, which ended on Sept. 30, brought in 10% more revenue than the same period last year. The release of Battlefield occurred on Oct. 21 and FIFA on Sept. 27, just a few days before the end of the reported time frame. With the new game sales getting off to a good start for both titles, company management was optimistic that another strong quarter of growth is in the works.
Whether the momentum holds remains to be seen, as several direct competitors in the first-person-shooter genre are entering the fray. One week after Battlefield 1 came another EA title, Titanfall 2. Despite positive reviews from the gaming community, sales so far have disappointed.
Part of the reason for the poor showing for Titanfall may be that it was slated for release between Battlefield and EA competitor Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. As a result, it looks as if EA's other big release in Titanfall is getting cannibalized by Battlefield as well as suffering at the hands of the genre's other big rival franchise in Call of Duty.
There's no shortage of shooters to choose from for those looking to pass time this winter in front of a screen, controller in hand. Even with the competition, though, EA upped its full-year guidance for revenue to $4.78 billion from previously stated $4.75 billion. Earnings-per-share guidance increased to $2.69 from $2.56.
Despite the positive news, I think the numbers for Battlefield 1 are already factored into the current valuation. The stock jumped after the last quarter and increased guidance for the full year was reported, and prices are still hovering around all-time highs. Valuation as measured by 12-month trailing price-to-earnings is on the high end at 22.7, and forward price-to-earnings is still elevated at 19.6.

EA data by YCharts
With one first-person-shooter title excelling and another struggling thus far during the current quarter, the numbers are already baked into share prices. Even though Battlefield 1 is off to a hot start, it alone isn't enough to justify paying current prices for Electronic Arts' stock.

Revenue rose 10% year over year to $898 million, with the video game company's $566 million in high-margin digital sales comprising 63% of total revenue during the second quarter. That helped gross margin increase to 55.3% -- a 5.5-percentage-point improvement compared to Q2 2016 -- and furthered a multiyear trend of rising gross margins.

The company's EA Sports division continues to drive results, with highly profitable sales in the ""Ultimate Team"" modes of stalwart franchises FIFA, Madden NFL, and Hockey rising 15%, collectively, over the past year. In all, more than 43 million players engaged with EA Sports games across consoles and mobile devices in the second quarter.
Importantly, Electronic Arts' mobile business was again a bright spot, with mobile sales jumping 21% year over year to $149 million. Results at Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes was particularly strong, with average gameplay per player remaining steady at an incredible 2.5 hours per day in Q2.
Additionally, Electronic Arts is off to a fast start in Q3, with the recent launches of combat-based games Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. In fact, CEO Andrew Wilson said Battlefield 1's player engagement has been ""phenomenal,"" with its first week total player base coming in at nearly double that of a previous version of the game.
All told, net loss per share improved to $0.13 from $0.45 in the year-ago period, and surpassed EA's guidance for a loss of $0.51.  ""Q2 was an excellent quarter for Electronic Arts, led by breakthrough new EA SPORTS titles engaging players across console and mobile,"" said Wilson in a press release.
For the third quarter, Electronic Arts expects to generate revenue of approximately $1.125 billion, with a net loss of $53 million, or $0.17 per share.
In addition, Electronic Arts raised its full-year revenue outlook to $4.775 billion from $4.75 billion, and boosted its net income forecast to $848 million, or $2.69 per share, compared to prior estimates of $809 million and $2.56 per share. The company also reiterated its guidance for full-year operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion.
""We are in an outstanding position for the quarter ahead, with two of the highest-rated games of this console generation in Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, global competitive gaming tournaments under way, and our first virtual reality experiences coming soon,"" added Wilson. ""Across all platforms, this holiday season will be a fantastic time to play.""

Stocks declined on Wednesday as investors responded to increasing odds that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its monetary-policy meeting in December. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) finished in the red -- but also above their session lows.

Both the SPDR Select Financial Sector Fund (NYSEMKT:XLF) and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (NYSEMKT:GDX) ETFs saw heavy trading as the Fed announced its decision to leave interest rates in place for now while hinting at an expected increase next month. Officials said the case for a rate increase ""continued to strengthen"" over the past few weeks.
A few individual stocks managed gains even as broader indexes declined on Wednesday, including Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).
Business-review aggregator Yelp rose by as much as 17% on Wednesday before settling at a 10% increase. The company posted surprisingly strong third-quarter results before the opening bell that showed a 30% sales increase, as the local-business advertising market continues to shift online and toward its dominant platform. Yelp attracted enough new reviews to pass 115 user-generated critiques. Its push deeper into complementary business lines, such as restaurant reservations and food deliveries, is also showing promise: Transactions rose by 39% to 5.9 million.

""We had an outstanding quarter,"" CEO Jeremy Stoppelman said in a press release. ""We continue to pursue our mission of connecting consumers with great local businesses everywhere, and our local business in the U.S. has accelerated this year,"" Stoppelman continued.
Those gains aren't producing consistent profits yet. In fact, the company has lost money in three of the past four fiscal years. However, Yelp just logged its second straight quarterly profit gain and boasts a growing user base that's increasingly choosing to make transactions directly through its service. The question going forward will be whether Yelp can scale its business enough to bring costs down so that its adjusted profit margin rises from the 13% it saw last year to the 38% long-term target that management has laid out.
The surging demand for video games continues to surprise even the industry's biggest players. Electronic Arts' stock rose after the developer posted a 10% revenue bounce thanks to the popularity of its FIFA franchise, along with a 22% spike in its mobile gaming segment. Other good news for investors included solid initial engagement figures for the just-released Battlefield 1 shooter and a large improvement in gross profit margin, which rose by 5.5 percentage points to hit 55% of sales. EA's bottom-line $0.13-per-share loss beat the $0.17 per share of red ink that management forecast three months ago and marked a solid improvement over the prior year's $0.45-per-share loss.

""Net sales in the quarter were better than expected, driven by outperformance in FIFA, and supported by strong year-on-year growth in mobile,"" Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said in a press release.
Looking ahead, a lot is riding on the developer's holiday season performance, especially as it relates to sales figures for its high-budget Titanfall 2 release. EA executives like their chances with that game, even though rival Activision Blizzard launches its newest chapter in the Call of Duty franchise later this week.
EA boosted its fiscal 2017 guidance on Wednesday and believes that, between Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, it will have a good chance at dominating the shooter category and perhaps knocking Call of Duty off the top spot for the first time in years.

Early sales indicators for Titanfall 2 from Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) point to the game being a disappointment for the company. The game landed as the fourth best-selling title in the most recent U.K. weekly chart, falling short of EA's own Battlefield 1 -- which claimed the top spot for the second straight week since its launch. Titanfall 2 also came in below the company's FIFA 17, which released in Europe on Sept. 29.
With video game sales typically being highly front-loaded, Titanfall 2's failure to secure better performance on the U.K. charts in the week of its release is concerning, and negative indicators are not limited to the territory. Research firm Cowen & Company cut its global sales target on the game from 9 million units to between 5 million and 6 million units, and online feedback suggests that the game had a small enough player base after launch to make matching with other players difficult in some game modes.
The game appears to be suffering negative effects from releasing just one week after EA's own Battlefield 1 and one week before the debut of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare from Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).

Substantial underperformance for Titanfall 2 will negatively affect EA's earnings in its most important quarter, and could cause the company to shelve the franchise. EA had guided for between 9 million and 10 million units sold for the game, and it's likely that the title will fall well short of that target.
The original Titanfall sold somewhere around 7 million copies on Microsoft's Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC platforms, and failure to match that figure would represent a notable disappointment for the company, as it had anticipated the series would benefit from its debut on Sony's red-hot PlayStation 4 console. On the other hand, Battlefield 1 looks to be posting strong sales, which could offset some of a Titanfall 2 sales miss.
Taking a wider view, disappointing sales for Titanfall 2 probably do not represent a big threat to EA's long-term success. The company has a wide range of strong properties, and can withstand underperformance from a young franchise like Titanfall. However, it looks like the company's move to challenge Activision Blizzard's position in the first-person-shooter genre, by releasing two high-profile titles in short succession, has backfired.

The success of new games is why Activision Blizzard looks like a best gaming company now. Image source: Activision Blizzard
The gaming sector has been one of the best performing in the consumer-goods space so far in 2016, driven by new technology and an influx of new content that consumers are giving high ratings to. Content and online gaming stocks such as Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) are some of the obvious best gaming companies, though other companies benefiting from this sector -- companies such as Tencent's (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY) Riot Games, or chip companies such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) -- could all be set for more gains. Here are the best gaming stocks for betting on continued video-game growth.

Activision Blizzard has had a great year, and in the most recent quarter it handily beat expectations, with a 112% rise in sales and 315% rise in earnings per share year over year. This rise was due in part to a 13% increase in monthly active users. Activision is one of the top performers in the content-creation space of this market, largely because of its pipeline of new games that players are clearly loving, such as Overwatch, which was released in May and became an instant hit with, more than 7 million players in its first week after launch. 
Activision has also been incredibly successful with its switch to more in-game purchases and subscription content, which help revenue to stream in long after a title is purchased, making this one of the best online gaming stocks. On the mobile side, Activision bought King Digital, the maker of Candy Crush, in February and has been very successful in integrating this property to expand its mobile and digital presence. In the most recent quarter, digital sales rose to $1.4 billion, up 129% year over year.
Activision's largest competitor, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), has also produced some winning games as of late, such as its Star Wars Battlefront series, and has shown itself adept at making a play for the online gaming space as well. While EA's sales growth has been less impressive than Activision's -- up just 6% in the most recent quarter year over year -- it still looks as if it has plenty of potential to grow in this space, which is why analysts at Morgan Stanley said in September that both companies look like good bets. To make EA even more attractive, it also trades at nearly half the P/E of Activision.  
Both Activision and EA are clamoring to make a name for themselves in China, where video-game sales are booming and there are an estimated 700 million mobile users. A good play on this market specifically could be local NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES). This Chinese internet gaming company also offers many online services, such as email and advertising, but it's a dominating force in the booming gaming space, offering online gaming packs. NetEase also partners with Activision Blizzard to distribute many of its games throughout China. Another Chinese player worth mentioning is Tencent, which acquired the popular Riot Games in 2015. Similar to King Digital, Riot Games has had some major mobile game hits, such as Blitzcrank's Poro Roundup, and is helping Tencent to build out its own niche in the Chinese (and worldwide) gaming market. 
While much of the gaming focus has moved to mobile or computer desktop play, the original video-game system makers still have much to gain from the number of users of their equipment. However, new systems have proved to be only incrementally better in the most recent models, and it might prove wise to look at what new technology can really move the needle going forward. Virtual reality (VR) could be just that.
VR has gotten a lot of attention lately, as companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) invest in bringing the technology to the mass market. As VR headsets become cheaper and easier to acquire for average gamers, the companies producing this hardware could be set for big gains. Facebook is an interesting choice with its Oculus Rift, since the company also has such a large user base and a track record of online games on its platform performing very well. Of course, Facebook is such a mammoth company that even if its Oculus Rift is very successful, it may only slightly move the needle for Facebook's total sales. 
Sony's Playstation VR could make it a best gaming stock in the future. Image source: Sony
Sony (NYSE:SNE), on the other hand, is much more dependent on its gaming segment, which now makes up more than 20% of its total revenue, and in the most recent quarter it was the fastest growing division, reporting sales up 14% year over year, compared with a 10% drop companywide. Sony's gaming segment growth is driven by the PlayStation gaming console and equipment, and this segment could make up much of Sony's growth in the years to come. Sony's recently launched VR system, which is used in conjunction with the popular PlayStation 4 console, is already getting great reviews ahead of the holiday season. To be fair, VR is still largely untested as to whether it will drive profits renewed for Sony, but so far the industry buzz looks positive. 
The content being produced and the hardware it's played on creates a stunning overall experience for players -- but none of that would be possible without the incredibly powerful chips that power those graphics and the code the games run on. One of the best companies to bet on this portion of the gaming market is NVIDIA.
NVIDIA has been one of the pioneers in creating chips that can create the fast-moving and intricate visualizations in modern video games, powering games for nearly every major gaming company. NVIDIA also makes chips for the automotive industry's tech growth, and it will be an important voice in virtual reality and even artificial intelligence. NVIDIA stock has gained over 150% in the past 12 months, thanks to its incredible growth in sales and earnings, which were up 24% and 873%, respectively, in the most recent quarter year over year. NVIDIA is not cheap as a result, trading at a P/E of 47, but that price tag seems to be warranted, based on the company's ability to be the premium chipmaker not only for videogame growth but also for some of the most exciting tech growth of the decade.

Are you a fan of Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) World of Warcraft, or do you prefer a relaxing game of Madden NFL from Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA)? Whichever camp you belong to, there's good news today from the analysts at investment bank Morgan Stanley: Both companies are great, and both stocks are buys.
That's the upshot of a note just out from Morgan Stanley this morning, and reported on StreetInsider.com. Whether you've been considering an investment in Activision Blizzard stock, or in Electronic Arts instead, both stocks are undervalued at today's prices. According to Morgan Stanley, Activision Blizzard stock that costs just $44 and change today could soon sell for $56, while Electronic Arts stock that costs $84 could be worth as much as $101 a year from now. Accordingly, Morgan Stanley rates them both overweight.
Here are three things you need to know about that.
Gaming stock fans are legion -- and now Morgan Stanley is one of them. Image source: World of Warcraft.com.
Sales of physical video game discs are on the decline, a trend that has been evident for some time now. Considering that Morgan Stanley is publishing a recommendation on two companies that sell such games, you might think that would worry the analyst -- but it doesn't. In fact, says Morgan Stanley, it sees the traditional ""units sold"" metric for measuring success in the videogames world as increasingly irrelevant, and is shifting its focus instead ""to a model based on users, engagement, and digital monetization.""
""We are bullish on the digital gaming shift,"" says Morgan Stanley. ""We see digital in-game offerings leading to recurring and growing user bases, higher per-game engagement (time spent per user), and more monetization opportunities.""
Specifically, Morgan Stanley is vesting its hopes for Activision Blizzard stock and Electronic Arts stock outperforming the market on the prospect of gamers spending more money on in-game purchases. Such sales of ""expansions, new challenges, new characters, etc."" could potentially help grow the active user base at Activision 11% a year over the next five years, and Electronic Arts, 5% a year.
Revenue, too, should grow nicely with this shift in business model. Morgan Stanley predicts 16% annualized revenue growth for Activision and 15% for Electronic Arts over the next three years. In fact, says the analyst, ""digital rev,"" or ""in-game purchases + full game downloads,"" has the potential to drive literally ""all of ATVI/EA forward rev growth.""
Yes, you read that right. What Morgan Stanley is predicting, in essence, is zero growth in physical game sales going forward, and only growth in digital sales -- of full-game downloads, and in-game purchases.
If that sounds like a big bet to be making on the game makers, well, Morgan Stanley thinks it's a bet worth making. After all, it doesn't cost a lot to create an in-game item -- and it costs even less to reproduce it, and nothing at all to ship it. Morgan Stanley sees Activision Blizzard's and Electronic Arts' decision to focus on this market as giving a potentially huge boost to profit margins: ""We see op margins heading ~650 bp higher between now and '18 for both names,"" says the analyst, resulting in five-year earnings growth rates of 17% for Activision, and 14% for Electronic Arts.
So assuming Morgan Stanley is right about all the above, what does all this mean for owners of Activision Blizzard stock, and what does it mean for owners of Electronic Arts stock as well?
Well, that's where the bad news comes in. Priced at 44 times earnings today, Activision stock looks a mite pricey even if you assume Morgan Stanley is right about the 17% growth rate. Electronic Arts, selling for 22 times earnings, looks less overpriced based on 14% projected growth -- but is still pricey.
Viewed from the perspective of free cash flow meanwhile, the conclusions are reversed, but still similar. Over the past year, S&P Global Market Intelligence data show Activision generating $1.5 billion in positive free cash flow, which was more than twice the company's reported net income, and enough cash to give the company a price-to-FCF ratio of just 22. That's still a bit expensive for 17% growth, but less expensive than the P/E ratio makes it look.
Electronic Arts, on the other hand, generated just $937 million in FCF over the past 12 months, or only $0.81 in real cash profit for every $1 claimed in GAAP net earnings. Result: EA's P/FCF ratio of 27 is a bit more expensive than its P/E ratio makes it look -- and probably costs too much for 14% growth, in any case.
So long story short? Once again, we're facing a case of two strong companies, and two great stocks, which both unfortunately cost more than they are worth. While I commend Morgan Stanley for giving us a glimpse into the future of gaming, I have to take issue with its assessment that these two stocks are cheap enough to buy.
Because they simply are not.

            ","Business has slowed down for Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) in the last year, and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) is still attempting to mount a comeback under new leadership. The two companies have a different slant on the world of video gaming, one with roots in the console-based business and the other in mobile. With the important holiday shopping season right around the corner, which is a better buy for investors right now?

Electronic Arts recently reported results for the first quarter of its fiscal year, and the business turned in higher-than-expected numbers. Total revenue was $1.27 billion, 5.7% higher than the same quarter last year and 1.7% above previous company guidance.
Profit also came in better than expected. Earnings per share were $1.40, 6.1% higher than last year's quarter and 7.7% above company guidance. Despite the strong numbers during the quarter, the picture changes slightly when we look at the last trailing-12-month period.
Over the last 12 months, revenue is down 0.8% to $4.46 billion from $4.50 billion a year ago. The main reason is that sales of packaged games are down 10.3%. This figure is mostly, but not quite completely, offset by the 8.3% increase in digital sales in the last year.
The revenue numbers show a shift in the way customers make purchases. Rather than buying physical product, gamers are opting to make digital purchases where a copy of the game is downloaded to their console or computer. Sales have been moving this direction for the last few years and have been more than offsetting declines in physically packaged games until the last year.
However, this is more indicative of EA hitting a short-term soft spot in game sales rather than a long-term slowdown. Sales are expected to get a boost during the upcoming holiday shopping season when new chapters in the popular Titanfall and Battlefield franchises are released late in October.
The company guided revenue up to $4.75 billion this year, up from $4.4 billion last fiscal year. The anticipated increase in sales is seen coming from the new big titles coming out next month, as well as growth from the company's newer mobile gaming division that targets smartphone and tablet users. Far from sputtering, Electronic Art's business appears to be poised to grow further in the year ahead.

Social game developer Zynga also recently reported quarterly results that beat previous company guidance. Revenue was $181.7 million, down 9.1% from last year. Despite the drop in the top line, the bottom-line loss of $0.03 per share from a year ago narrowed to a $0.01 loss this last quarter.
Revenue has been consistently down this year from a year ago, but the company continues to inch its way toward profitability anyway as new CEO Frank Gibeau tightens up expenses and helps the business ""do more with less."" Through the first six months of Zynga's fiscal year, the bottom-line loss has been cut in half from the first six months of last year.
Despite progress made, the company still has a lot of work to do. Guidance for the next quarter was for revenue to still be down 13% to 8% from last year with another bottom-line loss of $0.03 to $0.04 per share.
Zynga focuses on free-to-play mobile games that generate revenue through advertising and in-game purchases. While this revenue model has been under pressure in recent years from increasing competition in the mobile game space, the company hopes to recapture interest with ad partners by growing its user base.
New game releases have started to help in recent months, with a new FarmVille game the most recent. New features have also been added to existing games like Words With Friends to lure casual gamers back. Slated for release during the holiday season is the new Dawn of Titans title, which aims to display mobile gaming's newfound complexity that can rival that of console-based video games.
Progress is being made, but it is still too early to say when Zynga will finish its turnaround strategy. However, Gibeau is formerly of Electonic Arts, with his last position there being the head of the mobile gaming division. With his help, the mobile division went from a non-reportable item for EA to a $500-million-a-year business. Under his tutelage, it is worth keeping an eye on Zynga's progress.
Though Zynga is starting to show signs of progress on its turnaround, Electronic Arts already has a developed business with a recipe for not only profitability, but also growth. In the quarters ahead, Electronic Arts has guided sales higher led by new title releases and the move toward digital gaming. For that reason, I think Electronic Arts is a better buy than Zynga at this point in time.

Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) stock has exploded in 2016, more than doubling by July and up 80% as of Sept. 12, thanks to the performance of its breakout Pokemon Go and the recent announcement of Super Mario Run for iOS. The push into mobile is exciting and has triggered a reappraisal of the value of the company's properties, but console and handheld hardware and software remain the core part of its business, accounting for more than half of revenue in the past fiscal year.
The company's mysterious upcoming platform, dubbed ""NX"" for the time being, represents a chance to recapture a larger segment of the gaming hardware market and create a healthy ecosystem for the company's non-mobile software. But Nintendo is facing an uphill battle in this endeavor, and counting on success in the company's traditional sphere is a risky proposition. How much faith should investors put in Nintendo's ability to compete with Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and counteract the negative effects that mobile gaming has had on its handheld business?
The NX is expected to be unveiled in October and is on track for a 2017 release. Comments from Nintendo management indicate that its next hardware move is to create a unified platform that combines elements of the handheld and home console. Reports from The Wall Street Journal and Engadget suggest that the new hardware will double as both a portable device and a home console, and rumors that the device will support cartridges rather than optical discs  seem to point in this direction.
Creating a console-handheld hybrid would enable Nintendo to concentrate its development resources rather than having to support disparate hardware. Nintendo's description of NX as a platform rather than a console might also point to iterative hardware updates that fall under the same ecosystem, a shift that would be in line with recent moves from Sony and Microsoft to release upgraded versions of their respective consoles that run the same software.
The 3DS and, to a much greater extent, the Wii U were hurt by having long windows between major software releases, as both systems relied on Nintendo for their biggest games. The move to a unified platform should lessen the time between major Nintendo releases and mitigate software droughts because it will allow the company to focus its resources instead of needing to develop different games to support a home console and a handheld, but the NX will have limited prospects if it can't attract strong third-party support. Publishers including Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) canceled major support for the Wii U early in the system's lifecycle and saw diminishing returns from releasing software on the 3DS handheld, as mobile gaming ate into the popularity of dedicated handhelds.
Nintendo's software output has been stronger than Microsoft's and Sony's in recent years, and it's reasonable to expect that this will continue to be the case. But the company's games have tended to attract a different audience from those of its console competitors, and that audience has not been very receptive to non-Nintendo games. For example, early reporting of Activision's 2013 release Call of Duty: Ghosts showed that the Wii U version accounted for just 0.33% of the game's sales, and EA stopped releasing games for the system less than a year after the system's release. Even with a massive installed base on the Wii, third parties often saw anemic sales on the console.
Some of the poor receptivity for third-party titles can be attributed to better versions being available on rival platforms. This often stemmed from Nintendo consoles having weaker hardware, and there's a danger that similar scenarios will play out with the NX. Both the Wii and the Wii U were relatively under-powered compared to their generational competition, which meant that games looked and performed better on other platforms and that developers were unable to easily transfer engines or assets to them. If Nintendo's upcoming NX platform really does double as a portable and home console, it's probable that the system will fall short of the graphical capabilities of Sony's and Microsoft's consoles, and that technical constraints will put off developers.   
Nintendo will also need to more fully embrace online play if the NX is to be a hit in the current climate. Some progress on this front is to be expected, but the company's quiet track record in the online sphere makes it difficult to anticipate the type of huge jump that might be needed. 
For well over a decade, Nintendo's consoles have had less robust online support than the competition, and they have more recently required a relatively cumbersome process to add players to online friends lists and lacked features including cross-game voice chat. With the Wii U, the company's decision not to emphasize online play as a major selling point and frequently bare-bones functionality in its own games contributed to an ecosystem that had relatively low online engagement, a condition which EA Chief Competition Officer Peter Moore pointed to as a contributing factor in his company's decision to abandon the system. Online play can be a big factor in driving revenue after the initial sale of a game, and unless Nintendo can establish the NX as a thriving platform for connected play, third parties are likely to be discouraged.  

Hardware sales accounted for more than half of Nintendo's revenue in the past fiscal year, and controlling its own platform probably gives the company better margins on its software than mobile releases will, as well as licensing fees from third-party publishers. Initiatives including mobile development, the upcoming Pokemon film produced through a partnership with Legendary Pictures, and the incorporation of Nintendo characters at Comcast's Universal parks have big potential, but the recent excitement reflected in the company's valuation boom won't hold up if Nintendo hardware continues on its current trajectory.
Sales of the company's Wii U console sit at roughly 13 million units -- down from over 101 million units for its predecessor, the Wii. The company's 3DS handheld has sold roughly 60 million units worldwide -- down from roughly 154 million units for the DS handheld that released in 2005. For now, there's good reason to be skeptical about Nintendo's ability to deliver a turnaround hit with the NX.

Release timing can have a big impact on a video games' sales, and Titanfall 2 from Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) looks like it could be heading for trouble because of tough competition. The game will launch Oct. 28, one week after EA's own Battlefield 1 and one week before Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare -- the two biggest 2016 releases in the shooter genre.
Is Titanfall 2 in danger of getting lost in the shuffle of more high-profile releases? If so, what would disappointing sales for the game mean for Electronic Arts?
The original Titanfall was released exclusively for Xbox consoles and PC, and EA and Microsoft touted it as a potentially ground-breaking title. Respawn, a studio that former leads on Activision's Call of Duty series founded, was responsible for developing the game, with Microsoft handling advertising duties in exchange for keeping the game exclusive to the company's gaming platforms. While the game rolled out to solid reviews, Titanfall didn't make the lasting impact on the first-person-shooter genre or the console race between the Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 that many had anticipated. 
In June, EA announced that the game had sold 7 million copies, a seemingly impressive figure. However, the game had been largely discounted and bundled with hardware following its March 2014 release, and the 7 million sales figure might also include downloads through the EA Access service. With EA and Microsoft opting not to make any exclusivity deals for the sequel, Titanfall 2 will launch for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. EA is targeting between 9 million and 10 million copies sold for the game and anticipates that sales growth will be spurred by greater installed bases for current-generation consoles and launching the series on Sony's latest platform.
If Titanfall 2 proves to be a high-quality product and delivers welcomed improvements over its predecessor, the significance of a crowded release window should be lessened and the title could steal some thunder from Activision's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. On the other hand, Titanfall 2's ability to thrive amid bigger releases will be seriously diminished if the game fails to deliver a top-notch experience. This type of scenario has already played out in the first-person-shooter genre this year, with Activision Blizzard's Overwatch heavily overshadowing Battleborn from Take-Two Interactive. Overwatch and Battleborn shared aesthetic and mechanical similarities; however, the former received a bigger marketing and press push and was ultimately regarded as a much better product, contributing to poor sales for Take-Two's genre release.
Unfortunately for EA, early feedback on Titanfall 2 from a demo trial suggests that the sequel's gameplay might not be resonating with players. One common complaint is that the game has been made to play more like an entry from the Call of Duty series.
With Battlefield 1 taking place in a World War I setting, Titanfall 2's futuristic theme places it closer in line with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. According to EA, the logic behind releasing Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 in such quick succession is to cover a broader segment of the shooter market during the year's key sales period and to strengthen the company's standing in the category in years to come. Activision's Infinite Warfare has received a mixed response from fans in the lead-up to its release, and EA is counting on winning sales away from Call of Duty by delivering two high-profile releases in the genre during the year's biggest sales window. 
Based on pre-release buzz and the caliber of its competition, Titanfall 2 is in real danger of getting lost among bigger releases in the Battlefield and Call of Duty series and struggling to meet its sales target. Releases in Activision's and EA's biggest FPS series routinely receive marketing budgets between $50 million and $100 million, and Titanfall 2 doesn't appear to have a comparable push behind it. The importance of multiplayer in the genre also means that established series enjoy a network effect, and the original Titanfall released over two years ago and hasn't maintained an active player base. 
With big franchises including Battlefield, FIFA, Madden, and Star Wars under its wing, Titanfall isn't one of EA's most important properties, so disappointing sales for the upcoming series release probably won't have a major effect on the company's long-term trajectory. However, should Titanfall 2 fail to improve on the sales of its predecessor, there's a good chance that EA will choose to shutter the series or experiment with taking it free-to-play.
Depending on the extent of possible under performance, Titanfall 2 could potentially negatively impact earnings in the company's most important quarter. However, weak games sales would probably be more indicative of the type of missed opportunity that's common in the games industry rather than a sign of more holistic issues at EA.

Revenue rose 5.7% to $1.271 billion, exceeding Electronic Arts' guidance of $1.250 billion.
The company's blockbuster combat-based game franchises such as Battlefield and Star Wars Battlefront continue to delight millions of fans, with more than 11.5 million and 6.6 million unique players in Q1, respectively.
Additionally, EA's Madden franchise remains a stalwart, with Madden NFL 16 unique players jumping more than 20% year over year, and monthly active players for Madden NFL Mobile surging 25% versus the prior-year period.
Importantly, the video game company's $689 million in high-margin digital sales comprised 54% of total revenue during the second quarter. That helped earnings per share increase 6.1% to $1.40, which also surpassed EA's guidance for $1.30 in EPS.
""Q1 was a great quarter for Electronic Arts with amazing engagement in our global communities,"" said CEO Andrew Wilson. ""EA is leading our industry through innovation, with more of our biggest games powered by Frostbite, breakthrough EA SPORTS titles on console and mobile, and the unstoppable combination of Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 coming this holiday. We're looking forward to connecting more players around the world to each other through the games they love to play.""
Electronic Arts expects to generate second-quarter revenue of approximately $915 million, with a net loss of $51 million, or $0.17 per share.
For fiscal 2017, Electronic Arts anticipates revenue of about $4.75 billion, with net income of $809 million and earnings per share of $2.56. The company is also forecasting full-year operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion.
""Our digital business drove this quarter, particularly outperformance from FIFA Ultimate Team on console and Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes on mobile,"" added CFO Blake Jorgensen. ""This success along with the launch of NBA LIVE Mobile gives us great confidence in our ability to operate and add new live services through the year.""

            ","Over the past decade or so, the video gaming industry has shifted to a digital purchase-based model. While this has stabilized cash flow for companies in the industry, it also presented them with plenty of new risks.
In this clip from from The Motley Fool's Industry Focus: Tech podcast, Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann talk about a few of the biggest challenges that companies like Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) are now facing with their online and mobile segments and what they're doing to maintain their positions as the dominant players in the space.

This podcast was recorded on June 10, 2016. 
Dylan Lewis: You mentioned in the first half the idea of this transition to digital, that there is not the physical case and disc that you're picking up at your GameStop (NYSE: GME), or something like that to be able to play these games. That leads this to being, in some ways, a very high-margin business to be in. You're eliminating all the physical stuff that goes into the product. I'm a little worried that that lowers the barrier to competition a little bit.
David Kretzmann: No, that's certainly right. I think that's a great way to put it. Another way to frame is that the switching costs for customers is much lower than it was 10 years ago when it comes to a game. Ten years ago, again, you go to the store. You pick it up off the shelf. You have the game on your shelf. You'll play it. You would have to go back out to get a game if you want to switch to a different game to play.
Especially with mobile and then this digital transformation in general, if you're on your phone, it takes you, what, 30 seconds to download a game. You can play it. You can fiddle around with it for maybe 20, 30 minutes if that. If you're not happy with it, worst-case scenario, you just leave it on your phone. You don't open it for six months. You forget, ""Oh I downloaded Bejeweled a year ago.""
It's painless to just uninstall that game and just install another game. Certainly, the switching costs are very low for customers. Especially on that mobile platform, you're seeing a trend where it's really a freemium experience. You're not even paying anything necessarily up front to play the game.
That mobile model is more challenging because you recognize that the majority of people who play a game on a mobile app are not going to pay anything. You're betting on that small fraction, maybe 1% or 2% of the really power users who are going to be spending half the day on the game. They're going to be buying different credits and stuff to progress through the game.
That's a more challenging model. There has certainly been a lot of risks that come with that. Yeah, that transition to mobile and digital, I agree. It does have more risks. It pressures the companies like Activision and Electronic Arts. They have to engage with their users much more regularly than launching a game every year or two, which is what they were doing maybe 10 years ago. Now, as I said, with Electronic Arts, it's not uncommon for them, with their popular games to be releasing daily, or weekly updates.
Companies that can make that transition, they should do well. It's on them to maintain that engagement with customers. Companies that don't do that are probably going to have a difficult time. Competition can swoop in much more easily now than 5 or 10 years ago.
Lewis: Yeah, and on the note of staying relevant, I think another one of the major risks with these types of businesses is that being a video game publisher is a lot like being a movie studio. You need to keep pumping out hits. Luckily, for both of these companies, they have very established, rooted franchises that they have been able to milk for quite some time. It's amazing the grapple that EA has had on sports games.
Kretzmann: Even so, obviously EA, they've done a great job, especially with their FIFA and Madden franchises. They have other sports franchises that have done really well, but then within the past five years or so, you have this smaller company, Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ: TTWO), which comes out with a NBA 2K, which is now the dominant game for basketball video games, at least for the NBA.
Even in a case with EA, you have a dominant market position. They control the vast majority of that market share of sports video games. Even then, if they get complacent and they're not putting the energy into a game and making it player-friendly and making it what players want, that opens up the door for competitors. For EA and Activision, certainly they have these dominant franchises, so long as they can continue to update them and keep them relevant for people, they should do well.
Going back to mobile, and just an example of Electronic Arts, they've managed to do pretty well with some of their mobile games. They have Madden NFL mobile games. They also have a lot of the... Disney (NYSE: DIS) licensed their Star Wars games to Electronic Arts. The Star Wars mobile game that Electronic Arts has, in the most recent quarter, the average player of that Star Wars mobile game spent two hours a day on that game. That's the average player. That's not just the top tier. That's the average player. Electronic Arts, they have found different ways to really break into that market.
Monetizing it is another story, but at least having that engagement, that's the first step. Anytime you go to a new platform, you want to have that engagement. The monetization will come after that. The engagement is the first step, then monetization will come. It's an interesting space to watch. So far, both these companies, in their own ways, have found ways to transition nicely to that digital model. Anytime that your margins are ticking up, like both these companies, you're inevitably going to attract new competitors. That'll be the thing to watch in the coming years.
Lewis: Was it Jeff Bezos that said, ""Your margins are my opportunity?""
Kretzmann: Exactly. There's a big, growing target on the backs of both these companies. It'll be interesting to see how they fend off competitors. Whether they acquire new games or acquire new companies to better reach customers on these platforms or license new games and franchises, they have different opportunities. Both these companies are flush with cash and producing a lot of free cash flow and their margins are very strong. They have the resources.
It's really just a matter of how effectively they allocate that capital to strengthen their competitive position, invest in the games, invest in that player engagement. If they can do that effectively, they should be able to grow for a long time, but if they get complacent and just sit on their cash and put their feet up on the table and sit back, they could lose that competitive position pretty quickly.

            ","The video gaming industry's business model isn't what it was a decade ago. 
One obvious way a video game company can make major profits is to build a hit franchise. Just as Hollywood movie studios know that the right sequel can provide a guaranteed box office payday, the same can be true when it comes to video games.
In this clip from from The Motley Fool's Industry Focus: Tech podcast, Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann talk about why many video game publishers have shifted to an online purchase-based model, and how they are managing their franchises. They also look at how companies like Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) are starting to use movies and TV shows to extend the value of their intellectual property. 

This podcast was recorded on June 10, 2016. 
Dylan Lewis: One of the other major catalysts I see for both of these companies is the idea of extending their existing franchises, possibly even licensing out their franchises. We've definitely seen Activision Blizzard do this a bit in the past with World of Warcraft. It sounds like their strategy might be shifting a little bit with that.
David Kretzmann: Yeah, so backing up a little bit, 10 years ago, when you bought a game, you would pick up the case off the shelf. You would install it on your computer, or your console, and then you would play it maybe five or six months. You get tired of the game, you move on. Now, both for Activision and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), they make more than half their revenue through digital sales. Rather than going to the store and buying the copy, oftentimes you can just download a game online onto your console, onto your PC, play the game.
The life of these franchises is now being extended thanks to these digital purchases, or micro transactions within the game. It's no longer just a case where a customer is making a one-time purchase of a game. You might buy the game, and then after you accomplish so much within the game, suddenly you have the opportunity to pay maybe $3 to open up another map in the game you're playing, or maybe you want to buy a certain jersey for your NBA team, or your FIFA team.
There are all sorts of these different micro transactions. You're seeing, with these video game companies, it's no longer the one-time purchases, but they're stretching out the life of their franchises. It turns out that digital revenue -- it's higher margin for the company. It stabilizes their cash flow production. It's appealing for investors and it's appealing for gamers, too. You're able to really engage with the game in a new way.
You have these companies; Electronic Arts has especially made a concerted effort. They're almost releasing daily, or weekly updates to some of these games, not just on mobile, but on other platforms. The game is really a living entity now. It's not just this one-time thing that you purchase. It's something that you can engage with for a very long time. That's certainly an important shift that's been happening in the space. It's likely to continue going forward.
Lewis: One of the things that we've seen on Activision side, at least, is the idea of these properties having value outside of the game themselves. We look at the World of Warcraft movie which Activision ...
Kretzmann: We'll see how that does. It's coming out.
Lewis: The idea that they are able to take what was a game and was on a gaming platform and bring it out to a mass audience in the form of a movie.
Kretzmann: Right. Video games, up to this point, they have been infamous for not transferring well to the movie screen. In the case of Warcraft, which has received mixed reviews up to this point, that wasn't actually created in-house by Activision. It was licensed out, I believe to Universal.
Similarly, last year Activision actually created a movie and TV production studio. They have a guy heading it up who spent nine years at Disney (NYSE:DIS) as a senior vice president. The guy heading it up, Nick van Dyk I believe is his name. He was a key player at Disney for the acquisitions of Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm.
Activision, they're making an effort again, similar to what they're doing in e-sports, they have a new division for movie and TV production where they're acknowledging that they have this extensive library of intellectual property, and these very vibrant game franchises that have done very well for more than a decade like Warcraft, and Call of Duty.
One of the early projects for this production studio is creating a cinematic universe for Call of Duty. We'll see if this studio can break the curse that's fallen on video games when people try to make a movie out of them. It's a similar approach to what you've seen Disney take. Activision, in a lot of ways, is becoming mini-Disney with what they're doing. They're trying to have the broadcasting platform with e-sports. Obviously they have the games, the core franchises there. Now they're trying to extend those franchises to movies and TV shows.
When you look at Activision, I see them as taking a similar strategy to maybe what Disney was doing 15 years ago. It doesn't mean that Activision will be as successful, or as big as Disney; perhaps one day. I think it's interesting to compare Activision's strategy to what we saw from Disney years, or decades ago.

            ","Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) are two of the biggest players in the video gaming industry. Although they're similarly situated, with similar growth opportunities, and offer dividends that yield a like amount, one still manages to stand out.
In this clip from from the Industry Focus: Tech podcast, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann talk about which one they'd rather invest in and why.

This podcast was recorded on June 10, 2016. 
Dylan Lewis: The two giants in the space, Activision and EA, a little bit different as company profiles. A little bit more growth priced into Activision at the moment. They also have a 0.7% dividend yield?
David Kretzmann: Yeah.
Lewis: Yeah, so it's there. It's not big, but it's there. EA is a little bit more moderate growth expectation. One in particular that you like more?
Kretzmann: I honestly like both these companies. I personally own shares of both of them. I think if you were only going to pick one, Activision would probably be the one I'd lean toward, just because I like how they're making these different efforts with mobile games, e-sports, and that movie and TV studio. I think they have more growth avenues beyond just the game franchises.
That's more of the model that EA is focusing on. They've done a good job with that. They've really turned that company around over the past three to four years. The new CEO at Electronic Arts, he's a young Aussie, Andrew Wilson. He's in his 40s. He's done a great job turning around that company and the culture.
I think if you had to pick one, Activision just has a more diversified line, not only of franchises, but also of different divisions with e-sports, movies and TV, all those things. It's run by Bobby Kodick, who has just been a wonderful CEO. I think it's hard to go wrong with either of these companies, but if I had to pick one, I would probably lean toward Activision at this point.

            ","More people are playing video games than ever before.
But how they play games, where they buy them, and what devices they play them on have changed. In fact, in just a few short years the gaming industry has changed dramatically and this may only be the beginning.
In this clip from from The Motley Fool's Industry Focus: Tech podcast, Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann talk about where the video gaming industry is today in terms of size and reach. Also, they take a closer look at one of the industry's giants, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and how it has grown its impressively huge user base.

Dylan Lewis: We're going to be talking video games today. Before we dive into the companies, I have to ask: Did you have a favorite video game growing up?
David Kretzmann: Growing up, my family didn't have any of the fancy consoles, so I never had a PlayStation, or an Xbox. I would have to go over to a friend's house to play that. On our Windows 95 computer -- and we kept this computer specifically for these two games -- I played Road Rash and then Warcraft II special edition, Tides of Darkness. Those were the two games I played in my own house on a somewhat regular basis.
Lewis: I was raised in a very similar household, where my parents told me, ""We're not buying you a video game console. If you want one, you have to buy it yourself."" Eventually, I saved up and got enough for the PS2. That was my console. That was my baby as a kid. When you're young, you're just like, ""Boy, I really hope I have a sleepover sometime soon. I really want to go to that guy's house who has the Xbox.""
Kretzmann: Yeah, some popular friends on the block.
Lewis: That Warcraft reference is a nice transition into one of the companies we're going to be talking about. Before we get too far into the stocks that we'll be discussing on today's show, I figure we'll set a little groundwork here for what the gaming industry looks like. I'm just going to throw out a couple different estimates of market size I've seen lately.
Digital gaming was a $60 billion-plus market last year. That was actually led by PC gaming, which is surprising. You hear all this about the death of PCs, or the rise of the tablets, or the multi-capable devices, switch over to mobile. PC gaming still leading the charge there.
The worldwide mobile gaming market is a high $20 billion market. I've seen projections that that will hit $45 billion by 2018. Just to give you an idea of where this market's going, some big growth expected and not necessarily from the areas that you might be expecting it.
Kretzmann: Yeah, absolutely. There is a lot of different growth arenas in this space. To give some additional context, 10 years ago there were 200 million players, 200 million gamers. Five years ago that increased to 1.5 billion. Most recently, the most recent number I have seen is 2.6 billion gamers worldwide. You're seeing more and more gamers, more and more platforms that people can play the games on, so a lot of growth happening in this space.
There have been a lot of great investments in it over the past 5, 10 years. I think some of the names we'll talk about today, there's a lot of potential there for investors going forward as well.
Lewis: The two big names, at least as far as I'm concerned in the video game market, Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). These are both video game publishers. Activision's made shareholders pretty happy over the last couple years. They've got some big time franchises under their belt: World of Warcraft, Call of Duty.
Electronic Arts, most of the people know them for their sports games. They're trying to move beyond that a little bit right now. You want to start out with Activision; talk a little bit about what they're doing?
Kretzmann: Let's do it. Yeah. As you mentioned, Activision, they have the No. 1 console franchise, which is Call of Duty. This is a franchise that's been out for about a decade -- I think a little more than a decade, I think 12 years. Each year or so, they'll issue a new iteration of that franchise, an extension, a different version. It's been just an amazing seller for the company.
Similarly, with PC gaming, you have World of Warcraft, which has been just a juggernaut of a game. It's actually a subscription model. You pay a monthly subscription, and you can play in this online fantasy world with your friends and other players around the world. Warcraft, the most recent numbers I saw, there are still more than 5 million players with Warcraft.
Activision, a massive company in this space. It's the largest video game software publisher in the world. Last year -- we'll talk about this more I'm sure -- they acquired King Digital (NYSE:KING), which is a large mobile game operator.
By bringing King Digital under its umbrella, Activision now has more than 500 million monthly active users through all of its different games and platforms. That's a user base that's rivaled by only a few companies out there like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), YouTube, some juggernaut brands out there. Activision has a huge audience.
To give you another pretty staggering number, over the past year audiences spent 42 billion hours playing and watching Activision's games. They have a lot of people paying a lot of attention to their games.

Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) press conference and demo event marked the unofficial start of this year's E3 gaming expo, with the company giving game industry watchers a look at some of the big titles in its development lineup. The company's share price has shown little movement since its conference and demo event, suggesting that the press events delivered little in the way of surprises.
While the market has not had much of a reaction following the glut of news, the games announced and presented will have a big impact on EA's performance through the next several years, so it's worth diving into what the company put on display. 
Electronic Arts debuted FIFA 17 and Madden 17, upcoming entries in its biggest sports franchises, at its press event. While both games will still land on Sony's PlayStation 3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360, it's clear that the company's development priorities are now primarily vested in newer platforms. The PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC versions of the upcoming FIFA game will make use of a new development engine that allows better utilization of modern graphics capabilities, in addition to offering new modes and other exclusive features. Madden 17 will also have new modes and downloadable content updates that are not available in last-gen versions of the game. 
With sales of last-gen consoles dropping off rapidly, the move to split development for its key sports franchise appears to be a good way for the company to continue to derive sales from the large user bases on older hardware, while also ensuring that two of its marquee properties can take better advantage of current-gen hardware features.
Along with unveiling the latest upcoming installments in the FIFA and Madden series, Electronic Arts took the opportunity to demo gameplay footage for its previously announced Battlefield 1 and announce sequels in the Titanfall and Mass Effect series, as well as a slew of new Star Wars games.
Following last year's Star Wars Battlefront, which surpassed 14 million unit sales as of this past May, EA has a big opportunity with games set in the galaxy far, far away. The publisher appears to be taking full advantage of its exclusive license from Disney to make Star Wars games, with a Battlefront sequel slated for release in 2017, a ""narrative action game"" set for 2018, and a project from EA's Respawn development studio also in the works. In addition, EA's Star Wars reel promised new additions to its Galaxy of Heroes mobile title and its Old Republic online role-playing game, while also indicating that at least one in-development game will be compatible with Sony's PlayStation VR platform.
Upcoming release Titanfall 2 is slated for an Oct. 28 launch, which would see it debuting just one week after Battlefield 1's scheduled Oct. 21 launch date. While the first entry in the Titanfall series was exclusive to Xbox and Windows platforms because of a marketing partnership with Microsoft, the recently unveiled sequel will also land on Sony's PlayStation 4 console.
The original Titanfall, released in 2014, was pitched by Electronic Arts and Microsoft as the next big thing in the first-person shooter (FPS) genre, but the game lacked staying power and likely failed to live up to sales expectations. Addressing one of the core complaints about the original Titanfall, the sequel is adding a ""story mode"" and looks to offer more content than its predecessor. Titanfall 2 could benefit from exposure to the PS4 user base, but the game also faces the risk of being overshadowed by EA's own Battlefield release and Activision Blizzard's upcoming Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare.
Between EA's two scheduled FPS releases in 2016, Battlefield 1 will likely be the more significant. The game's World War I setting does present a sales variable (EA reportedly rejected the initial pitch for the game over concerns about marketability), but promotional materials for the game have generated great buzz, and hands-on impressions with the game have been very positive.
In a crowded genre that has seen most of its big releases steeped in modern or future combat settings, Battlefield 1 has the opportunity to stand out and could help the already successful franchise gain ground against Activision's Call of Duty. Both Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare will be the first games in their respective series to launch only on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC platforms -- a factor that could help the Battlefield franchise narrow the sales gap.
In addition to game announcements, updates, and demos, EA also unveiled a publishing wing for games from independent developers and a new feature called Play to Give -- a cross-game charity platform that allows users to achieve in-game feats in order to trigger donations in support of various causes.
EA Originals, the company's new publishing label for games from indie developers, could prove to be a significant boon to the company's mobile ambitions and is a unit investors should keep an eye on. Considering that mobile gaming represents one of the company's biggest growth avenues, games for smartphones and tablets received relatively little focus. Still, a lack of time spent on this area is standard for E3 because of the nature of staged conferences and demo venues. The first game published under EA Originals, Fe, looks like it could be a mobile release, and it's reasonable to expect that the Originals unit will have a heavy mobile focus, given the trend of many independent developers. 
Overall, EA's press conference and demo event might have been short on surprises -- as many of the unveils were expected or leaked in advance -- but clear evolutions for some of the company's biggest game series, a range of upcoming Star Wars projects, and its new indie publishing wing showed a lot of promise.

Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, June 10th, and we're talking tech and video games. I'm your host Dylan Lewis and I'm joined in the studio by Motley Fool premium analyst David Kretzmann. David, how's it going?
David Kretzmann: It's great to be here, Dylan. Thanks for having me.

By bringing King Digital under its umbrella, Activision now has more than 500 million monthly active users through all of its different games and platforms. That's a user base that's rivaled by only a few companies out there like Facebook, [Alphabet's] YouTube, some juggernaut brands out there. Activision has a huge audience.
To give you another pretty staggering number, over the past year, audiences spent 42 billion hours playing and watching Activision's games. They have a lot of people paying a lot of attention to their games.
Lewis: I think one of the key things to hone in on there is watching, hearing you say that. Something that some of our listeners might not be as familiar with is the rise of what we're calling eSports now. There is the conventional gaming market where you have people buying titles either physically, or digitally, playing them. They're in-game purchases in some cases.
There's also this transition to a space in the industry where there's money to be made by selling video game experiences as sporting events.
Kretzmann: This is a concept that's popular internationally. It's becoming more common domestically as well, but especially in China and Asia, and Europe. eSports has been a rising phenomenon. You're even seeing dedicated stadiums built for people to watch the elite gamers play a video game. It's really the idea like you have the NBA, the National Basketball Association where you see the elite gamers, the elite basketball players play.
In a similar way eSports is this league, or this platform where you can watch the top tier gamers play. Some pretty amazing statistics here. In 2015, the second most viewed sporting event in the world, only behind the super bowl was the League of Legends world championship, which had 36 million viewers. That's ahead of game six of the NBA finals, which had Steph Curry and LeBron James, the best basketball players in the world, they had 29 million viewers.
The world series final game last year had 17 million viewers. 36 million people watched a world championship with League of Legends, a video game. That gives you an idea of just a staggering global audience for people who are actually sitting down and watching elite gamers play. It's still something I'm personally still trying to wrap my head around.
We have some gamers at the Fool who do spend time watching these tournaments and watching the elite players play. This is certainly a driving force with the industry. You have both Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, then other players even like Amazon with Twitch, with the acquisition they made a couple years ago. YouTube is spending more time streaming these gaming tournaments.
You're seeing a lot of big players make a concentrated concerted effort to dive into eSports and really drive that movement. It's certainly something to watch.
Lewis: I think one of the things that's particularly compelling with eSports is whereas with live sports, you are in a lot of ways selling tickets. There are instances where you're at a stadium and there are probably tens of thousands of people watching something.
This is a very scalable and online production for the people that are putting it on. It's a digital pass type approach. That's something that scales incredibly well when you're talking about porting it out online, or trying to sell some sort of a subscription service to it.
Kretzmann: Absolutely and you even are seeing some traditional networks like ESPN and TBS broadcasting some of these gaming tournaments. By and large it says something that's happening online, so it's still a question of how do you gain advertisers and sponsors for something like this? There hasn't been anything quite like this that we've seen.
I think a great example of the resources that companies are putting behind this; let's go with Activision Blizzard. In October of 2015, less than a year ago, they announced that they're creating an independent eSports division. The person they brought on to head up that division is Steve Bornstein, who was formerly the head of ESPN and the NFL Network. He's someone who knows a thing or two about sports broadcasting. They're bringing in a big gun from ESPN and the NFL network to head up eSports.
Bobby Kotick, the CEO of Activision Blizzard, he says he wants Activision to be the ESPN of eSports. We're still in the early phases of this happening. That eSports division, again, was only created less than a year ago, but then two months after that, Electronic Arts announced that it's launching a competitive gaming division, a similar division to what Activision is doing.
Like I said, you have Amazon with Twitch, where a lot of these games and tournaments are live-streamed and similar with YouTube. You're seeing a lot of big companies put a good amount of resources behind this space and bringing in talent from the traditional sports broadcasting role into this eSports world. You're seeing a blurring of the lines there.
Lewis: One of the other major catalysts I see for both of these companies is the idea of extending their existing franchises, possibly even licensing out their franchises. We've definitely seen Activision Blizzard do this a bit in the past with World of Warcraft. It sounds like their strategy might be shifting a little bit with that.
Kretzmann: Yeah, so backing up a little bit, 10 years ago when you bought a game, you would pick up the case off the shelf. You would install it on your computer, or your console, and then you would play it maybe five or six months. You get tired of the game, you move on. Now, both for Activision and Electronic Arts, they make more than half their revenue through digital sales. Rather than going to the store and buying the copy, often times you can just download a game online on to your console, on to your PC, play the game.
The life of these franchises is now being extended thanks to these digital purchases, or micro transactions within the game. It's no longer just a case where a customer is making a one-time purchase of a game. You might buy the game and then after you accomplish so much within the game, suddenly you have the opportunity to pay maybe $3 to open up another map in the game you're playing, or maybe you want to buy a certain jersey for your NBA team, or your FIFA team.
There are all sorts of these different micro transactions. You're seeing, with these video game companies, it's no longer the one time purchases, but they're stretching out the life of their franchises. It turns out that digital revenue it's higher margin for the company. It stabilizes their cash flow production. It's appealing for investors and it's appealing for gamers, too. You're able to really engage with the game in a new way.
You have these companies; Electronic Arts has especially made a concerted effort. They're almost releasing daily, or weekly updates to some of these games, not just on mobile, but on other platforms. The game is really a living entity now. It's not just this one-time thing that you purchase. It's something that you can engage with for a very long time. That's certainly an important shift that's been happening in the space. It's likely to continue going forward.
Lewis: One of the things that we've seen on Activision side, at least, is the idea of these properties having value outside of the game themselves. We look at the World of Warcraft movie which Activision...
Kretzmann: We'll see how that does. It's coming out.
Lewis: The idea that they are able to take what was a game and was on a gaming platform and bring it out to a mass audience in the form of a movie.
Kretzmann: Right. Video games, up to this point, they have been infamous for not transferring well to the movie screen. In the case of Warcraft, which has received mixed reviews up to this point, that wasn't actually created in-house by Activision. It was licensed out, I believe to Universal.
Similarly last year Activision actually created a movie and TV production studio. They have a guy heading it up who spent nine years at Disney (NYSE:DIS) as a senior vice president. The guy heading it up, Nick van Dyk I believe is his name. He was a key player at Disney for the acquisitions of Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm.
Activision, they're making an effort again, similar to what they're doing in eSports, they have a new division for movie and TV production where they're acknowledging that they have this extensive library of intellectual property and these very vibrant game franchises that have done very well for more than a decade like Warcraft and Call of Duty.
One of the early projects for this production studio is creating a cinematic universe for Call of Duty. We'll see if this studio can break the curse that's fallen on video games when people try to make a movie out of them. It's a similar approach to what you've seen Disney take. Activision, in a lot of ways, is becoming mini Disney with what they're doing. They're trying to have the broadcasting platform with eSports. Obviously they have the games, the core franchises there. Now they're trying to extend those franchises to movies and TV shows.
When you look at Activision, I see them as taking a similar strategy to maybe what Disney was doing 15 years ago. It doesn't mean that Activision will be as successful, or as big as Disney, perhaps one day. I think it's interesting to compare Activision's strategy to what we saw from Disney years or decades ago.
Lewis: The franchises in eSports, two major catalysts to watch for gaming stocks. You mentioned the move to digital. I think that actually poses a little bit of a risk for some of these video game companies. We're going to talk about that on the second half of the show.
Before we do, this episode of Industry Focus is brought to you by Harry's. Father's Day is coming soon. Dads, brothers, and grandfathers can be tough to shop for. Thankfully, Harry's has got you covered. While supplies last, Harry's is offering a special limited edition set for Father's Day.
The set includes a matte black razor handle, chrome razor stand, moisturizing foaming shave gel, three handcrafted blade cartridges, and a travel cover, all for $40. Plus it comes with a sleek giftable box with the option to add the custom engraving and a personalized card. Even better, the giftable set can be shipped directly to your door.
Vincent Shen hinted, on the CG show, a little bit earlier in the week. I decided to give Harry's a whirl this week since we are promo-ing it on the show. I am currently sporting... You can agree or disagree here, David, what I can best describe as a face for radio. Not because I nicked myself shaving, but Harry's blades are actually pretty nice, pretty comfortable. They give you a nice, clean shave, but because of the arrangement of my facial hair. What do you think?
Kretzmann: It's glorious. It's like a question mark on your face.
Lewis: Yeah, like an upside down swirl question mark?
Kretzmann: Right. It's great. Glorious.
Lewis: Listeners might not know this, but I've had a light beard the entire time I've been at the Fool. Since Harry's is sponsoring the show, I decided to have some fun here at HQ. Told co-workers that if they raised a certain amount of money, I'd shave my beard into whatever configuration they wanted and keep it for three days. Wound up raising over $700 for Pencils of Promise, which is a Fool favorite charitable organization.
I'm currently sporting what some people call a money tail beard. If you want to see it, we're going to tweet a photo on the Industry Focus account on Twitter. The point is this is the first time I've used a razor in years. It was pretty painless. Harry's stuff is great. There's a nice feel to the razor. The shave cream smells absolutely fantastic.
The best part is their kits come in at about half as much as other razor brands. Why pay $32 bucks for an 8-pack of blades when you can get them for half the price at harrys.com? If you want to check them out, go to harrys.com. We're giving a special offer for fans of the show. Harry's will give you $5 off your first purchase with the promo code ""fool"". That's H-A-R-R-Y-S.com, enter code ""fool"" at checkout and get $5 off. Of course, you can get your dad something he'll actually use this Father's Day. Thank you, Harry's for your promotion and support of Industry Focus!
David, back for the second half of the show talking video game stocks. You mentioned in the first half the idea of this transition to digital, that there is not the physical case and disc that you're picking up at your GameStop, or something like that to be able to play these games. That leads this to being, in some ways, a very high margin business to be in. You're eliminating all the physical stuff that goes into the product. I'm a little worried that that lowers the barrier to competition a little bit.
Kretzmann: No, that's certainly right. I think that's a great way to put it. Another way to frame is that the switching costs for customers is much lower than it was ten years ago when it comes to a game. Ten years ago, again, you go to the store. You pick it up off the shelf. You have the game on your shelf. You'll play it. You would have to go back out to get a game if you want to switch to a different game to play.
Especially with mobile and then this digital transformation in general, if you're on your phone, it takes you what? 30 seconds to download a game. You can play it. You can fiddle around with it for maybe 20, 30 minutes if that. If you're not happy with it, worst case scenario, you just leave it on your phone. You don't open it for six months. You forget, ""Oh I downloaded Bejeweled a year ago.""
It's painless to just uninstall that game and just install another game. Certainly, the switching costs are very low for customers. Especially on that mobile platform, you're seeing a trend where it's really a freemium experience. You're not even paying anything necessarily up front to play the game.
That mobile model is more challenging because you recognize that the majority of people who play a game on a mobile app are not going to pay anything. You're betting on that small fraction, maybe 1% or 2% of the really power users who are going to be spending half the day on the game. They're going to be buying different credits and stuff to progress through the game.
That's a more challenging model. There has certainly been a lot risks that come with that. Yeah, that transition to mobile and digital, I agree. It does have more risks. It pressures the companies like Activision and Electronic Arts. They have to engage with their users much more regularly than launching a game every year or two, which is what they were doing maybe 10 years ago. Now, as I said, with Electronic Arts, it's not uncommon for them, with their popular games to be releasing daily, or weekly updates.
Companies that can make that transition, they should do well. It's on them to maintain that engagement with customers. Companies that don't do that are probably going to have a difficult time. Competition can swoop in much more easily now than 5 or 10 years ago.
Lewis: Yeah, and on the note of staying relevant, I think another one of the major risks with these types of businesses is that being a video game publisher is a lot like being a movie studio. You need to keep pumping out hits. Luckily, for both of these companies they have very established rooted franchises that they have been able to milk for quite some time. It's amazing the grapple that EA has had on sports games.
Kretzmann: Even so, obviously EA, they've done a great job, especially with their FIFA and Madden franchises. They have other sports franchises that have done really well, but then within the past five years or so, you have this smaller company, Take-Two Interactive, which comes out with an NBA 2K, which is now the dominant game for basketball video games, at least for the NBA.
Even in a case with EA, you have a dominant market position. They control the vast majority of that market share of sports video games. Even them, if they get complacent and they're not putting the energy into a game and making it player friendly and making it what players want, that opens up the door for competitors. For EA and Activision, certainly they have these dominant franchises, so long as they can continue to update them and keep them relevant for people, they should do well.
Going back to mobile, and just an example of Electronic Arts, they've managed to do pretty well with some of their mobile games. They have Madden NFL mobile games. They also have a lot of the... Disney licensed their Star Wars games to Electronic Arts. The Star Wars mobile game that Electronic Arts has, in the most recent quarter, the average player of that Star Wars mobile game spent two hours a day on that game. That's the average player. That's not just the top tier. That's the average player. Electronic Arts, they have found different ways to really break into that market.
Monetizing it is another story, but as least having that engagement, that's the first step. Anytime you go to a new platform, you want to have that engagement. The monetization will come after that. The engagement is the first step, then monetization will come. It's an interesting space to watch. So far, both these companies, in their own ways have found ways to transition nicely to that digital model. Anytime that your margins are ticking up, like both these companies, your inevitably going to attract new competitors. That'll be the thing to watch in the coming years.
Lewis: Was it Jeff Bezos that said, ""Your margins are my opportunity?""
Kretzmann: Exactly. There's a big, growing target on the backs of both these companies. It'll be interesting to see how they fend off competitors, whether they acquire new games, or acquire new companies to better reach customers on these platforms, or license new games and franchises, they have different opportunities. Both these companies are flush with cash and producing a lot of free cash flow and their margins are very strong. They have the resources.
It's really just a matter of how effectively they allocate that capital to strengthen their competitive position, invest in the games, invest in that player engagement. If they can do that effectively, they should be able to grow for a long time, but if they get complacent and just sit on their cash and put their feet up on the table and sit back, they could lose that competitive position pretty quickly.
Lewis: Yeah. The two giants in the space, Activision and EA, a little bit different as company profiles. A little bit more growth priced into Activision at the moment. They also have a .7% dividend yield?
Kretzmann: Yeah.
Lewis: Yeah, so it's there. It's not big, but it's there. EA is a little bit more moderate growth expectation. one in particular that you like more?
Kretzmann: I honestly like both these companies. I personally own shares of both of them. I think if you were only going to pick one, Activision would probably be the one I'd lean toward, just because I like how they're making these different efforts with mobile games, eSports, and that movie and TV studio. I think they have more growth avenues beyond just the game franchises.
That's more of the model that EA is focusing on. They've done a good job with that. They've really turned that company around over the past three to four years. The new CEO at Electronic Arts, he's a young Aussie, Andrew Wilson. He's in his 40s. He's done a great job turning around that company and the culture.
I think if you had to pick one, Activision just has a more diversified line, not only of franchises but also of different divisions with eSports, movies and TV, all those things. It's run by Bobby Kodick, who has just been a wonderful CEO. I think it's hard to go wrong with either of these companies, but if I had to pick one, I would probably lean toward Activision at this point.
Lewis: Awesome, David. Thank you for your thoughts!
Kretzmann: Thanks for having me, Dylan. It's a pleasure.

            ","For almost a year, shares of video game designer Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) have traded sideways with little upward movement. This has happened despite another year of record sales and profits. Should investors stay away? Or are there plans in the works that could push the company's stock higher?

Data by YCharts
Traditional video games have been under attack from disruptive companies and technologies entering the fray over the last decade. This has especially hurt console gaming, which historically was Electronic Arts' bread and butter. Console designers and manufacturers like Microsoft and Sony have been adamant that innovation can counteract the disruption.
Speaking to the growing challenges ahead, Sony, maker of the PlayStation 4, asserted its confidence back in 2013 that console gaming could fight back with new features like streaming games and services, console-based apps, and upgraded technology.
While other game developers have struggled, EA has stood out. Packaged video games accounted for virtually all of the company's sales just a few years ago, but during its last fiscal year, revenue from that segment accounted for only 45% of the top line. This underlines the company's success in diversifying its business during a time of transition in the broader industry.
So what has Electronic Arts specifically done to keep up over the last few years? And can these initiatives propel the business higher?
The advent of mobile games has proven to be difficult for many developers, but EA has navigated the change successfully. At the beginning of this decade, its mobile gaming business was nonexistent. However, as of the most recent earnings release, 12% of total revenue was derived from mobile platforms, totaling $570 million in the last year.
The company has accomplished this feat with games developed in-house as well as acquisitions. Most notable among the acquisitions were the purchases of Chillingo in 2010 and PopCap Games in 2011. You may have heard about Chillingo and PopCap from your Angry Birds, Iron Force, Bejeweled, or Plants vs. Zombies addiction during your lunch break.
EA has also developed mobile hits in-house like The Sims, with the latest installment of that franchise recently hitting 200 million downloads; Madden NFL Mobile; and a few new Star Wars mobile games that the company licenses from Disney. Together with its mobile developer acquisitions, EA has created a thriving app-based business based on in-game advertising, in-game purchases, and premium mobile games for purchase. The mobile division has increased 13% year-over-year and is expected to continue growing in the double digits going forward.

The next generation of console video game platforms has been out for a couple of years now, and EA has capitalized on the new technology, which features improved graphics and performance, but that is only part of the story.
The bigger benefits for EA in the latest generation of game platforms have been in cloud-based downloads. While packaged game sales are up only 4% in the last year, full-game downloads have increased 25% over the same period. This is significant, because the switch from physical purchases to downloads equates to a higher profit margin business for game developers, as manufacturing, packaging, and distribution costs are reduced.
The ability to download extra content has also been a big hit, and the company's extra content revenue is up 20% over the last year. In addition to generating more sales, extra content helps extend the life of a game title. Players stay engaged longer if new features get added to the mix, which lessens the pressure on EA to quickly develop another big hit or full-feature new game to replace aging ones.
Closely tied to the cloud-based business is the newer subscription-based gaming business. Revenue from this area still represents less than 8% of the topline, and year-over-year growth is flat, but the extra service might help offset drops in revenue when new game sales are weak.
How does it work? The subscription service unlocks the social aspect of video games -- titles like the Battlefield franchise and Star Wars: Battlefront require a monthly subscription to play with other gamers online. Subscriptions in other games can also unlock extra content or features for players to use.
The subscription service not only diversifies the revenue stream, but it also helps the company the same way as downloadable content: The service extends the life expectancy of titles as gamers stay engaged for longer, increasing game loyalty. As a result, this helps lower development and other overhead costs for Electronic Arts.
As far as future projects go, the pipeline of new game releases and new content for existing games remains unchanged. The real story here is the company's continued migration to a digital business model that generates multiple revenue streams outside of the sales surge from a traditional game release.
The transition to a digital model is powerful. While the company's sales in its last fiscal year decreased about 2.5%, the cost of those sales decreased even more, at a rate of over 5% from the previous year. This helped bottom line profits increase over 30%.
Other irons in the fire include possibly game-changing virtual reality technology, further immersing players in the gaming experience and creating a new sales opportunity. The company also recently launched the EA Originals project, which seeks to fund a few small game developers each year and distribute their products to the public.
Electronic Arts has developed into a gaming giant, and growth is expected to move at a much slower rate than in past years. Profits are expected to grow an average of about 15% for the next five years, compared with an average of 30% over the previous five. While 15% growth is still impressive, that deceleration is currently baked into share prices and is part of the reason shares have been roughly flat for almost a year.
The company's one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 18.5 times, and the five-year PEG ratio, a measure of price versus expected profit growth, is at 1.4. A PEG over 1.0 would typically indicate a company enjoys a premium valuation. With the video game industry in transition and no slam-dunk opportunities ahead for major business expansion, Electronic Arts' current share price is a little rich for my taste at this time. That being said, the stability of the company's sales in a challenging and competitive industry is enough to put the stock on my radar.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) recently announced new gaming competitions for its own titles, starting with its flagship Madden series. The new push will include four EA-owned and operated tournaments dubbed ""majors,"" which will each be supported by corporate sponsors and broadcast partners. EA will offer up to $1 million in prizes throughout the series. 
That seven-figure prize pool makes it comparable to larger competitions in the industry, including recent Call of Duty and Counter-Strike tournaments which both had prize pools of $1 million. The move also indicates that EA is serious about following rival Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) aggressive expansion into e-sports. 

Madden NFL 17. Image source: EA.
SuperData Research estimates that there were about 134 million e-sport viewers worldwide last year, and it expects that figure to rise at a rate of 30% over the next five years. Amazon's Twitch, the top game streaming site in the world, has over 100 million broadcasters and viewers worldwide.
That impressive growth rate has drawn major sponsors to e-sports events, including Coca-Cola and Red Bull. The industry's expansion has also convinced Disney to broadcast e-sports related content on Disney XD and hire e-sports specialists at ESPN. 
For video game publishers like EA and Activision, e-sports events and live streams represent more effective ways to promote games than traditional ads. $1 million is barely enough to cover three 30-second TV ad spots during top-rated TV shows today, but it's enough to attract top gamers to gaming battles that can be watched by millions of viewers.
Activision CEO Bobby Kotick told The New York Times last year that his goal was to build the ""ESPN of video games."" To accomplish that, Activision acquired the assets of the IGN Pro League in 2013, and nearly all the assets of Major League Gaming (MLG) at the end of last year. 
Last October, it created a dedicated e-sports division and hired Steve Bornstein, the former CEO of ESPN and the NFL Network, to lead the new business. Earlier this month, Activision signed a live-streaming deal with Facebook to broadcast its most-watched games on Facebook Live.

EA launched its own e-sports unit dubbed the Competitive Gaming Division last December, and assigned COO Peter Moore to lead the unit as its ""chief competition officer."" CEO Andrew Wilson declared that the new division represented a ""groundbreaking opportunity for Electronic Arts to celebrate...passion for play and competition.""
Unfortunately, EA has a long way to go before it can catch up to the e-sports leaders. According to Gamoloco, Activision Blizzard publishes four of the 10 most-watched games (Hearthstone, Overwatch, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, and World of Warcraft) on Twitch. None of EA's games made the cut. 
EA knows that it's trailing far behind Activision in competitive gaming. During an investor presentation last month, EA stated that e-sports wouldn't generate much direct revenue on its own in the near term. But EA still committed itself to a three-year plan which could gradually expand its presence with amateur, mid-level, and professional tournaments.
EA is starting out with Madden for a simple reason -- it's one of its most popular franchises, and it comfortably bridges the awkward gap between traditional sports and e-sports. EA hopes to then expand top-tier tournaments to include its FIFA soccer franchise and Battlefield shooter games.
EA and Activision's expansion into e-sports matters for two main reasons. First, e-sports can reduce sales and marketing expenses by decreasing the company's dependence on traditional TV or web-based ads. E-sports and streamed games can reach a more targeted audience of gamers who might be more likely to purchase the games than non-gamers. This complements the shift from physical packaging to digital downloads, which significantly boosted publishers' operating margins.
Second, EA and Activision are both highly dependent on aging franchises like Madden and Call of Duty. Broadcasting e-sports events featuring new updates of these games can keep those franchises fresh and relevant to fickle gamers. 
Therefore, investors should consider e-sports to be an expansion of EA and Activision's marketing efforts, which could reach more gamers and boost margins in the long run. If EA falls behind Activision in this department, its titles could lose relevance with the millions of people who watch e-sports and live-stream games on a regular basis.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) stock popped to a new high last week after the company reported fantastic fourth-quarter revenue and profits. 
The video game company has found a way to use licensing and partnerships to wring the most money out of an industry that just a few years ago was thought to be dying. But with new technologies on the horizon that can make the gaming experience even more immersive, Electronic Arts may still have plenty of runway ahead of it.
In this segment from the Motley Fool Money radio show, Chris Hill, Simon Erickson, and Ron Gross talk about Electronic Arts' solid performance in the recent quarter and why the company has so much growth potential ahead of it. But with its stock at an all-time high, does that make it too pricey for investors?
A full transcript follows the video.

This podcast was recorded on May 13, 2016. 
Chris Hill: Disney (NYSE:DIS) might have struggled with video games, but Electronic Arts is hitting an all-time high this week after fourth-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. They are crushing it over there, Simon.  Simon Erickson: Yeah, and Chris, Jason just said, look at video game makers that can license Disney's brands. Electronic Arts is doing exactly that. They just came out with a Madden NFL 17. Chris, I don't know if you saw, Gronkowski is on the cover.  Hill: I'm worried. Isn't it that, historically, the football player on the cover of the EA NFL game gets injured that season?  Erickson: This could be a bad sign for you, then.  Hill: I don't like this at all.  Erickson: But EA, after Disney sets apart the Infinity video game group from being in-house, they're going to license it out to others. Of course, Electronic Arts has done that. They have the Star Wars franchise from Disney. That's really good news for them, too. This is a company that's getting it done. Eighteen percent growth in their digital revenue, which is distributed online, the actual games themselves. They're picking up, like we said, the Star Wars franchise. They have a lot of growth ahead of them.  Hill: Do you like EA at this price? It's an all-time high, I'm wondering how spicy it looks.  Erickson: Video gaming is a good industry. There's a lot of growth in this, and you actually get pretty attractive margins. So I think the question I should answer that with is, how much bigger is this going to get, as it becomes more immersive and virtual reality starts to catch on? I think there could still be more upside.  Ron Gross: And I do like the way the industry is going in terms of a recurring revenue model instead of these big hits here and there. That makes me much happier to own a stock over long periods of time, rather than thinking about too high, too low.

            ","Both mobile and console gaming are driving growth for Electronic Arts.
What: Shares of video-game maker Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) are up 12.6% at 12:08 p.m. ET on May 11, following the release of the company's fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2016 financial results after market close on May 10. 
So what: EA recorded its highest-ever adjusted revenue of $4.57 billion, 55% of which was digital. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $3.50 per share, up 30% from the year before. On an adjusted basis -- removing the non-cash earnings benefit of a valuation allowance reversal on certain deferred tax assets -- the company reported earnings of $3.28, up 27% from the year before. 
It also repurchased 15.7 million shares of stock for $1 billion, good for an average price of $63.69 per share, well below the current $73-per-share price. 
From an operating perspective, EA performed exceptionally well, with operating margin of 28.5%, triple the 9.5% operating margin from four years ago. The company also produced its most-ever profits of $1 billion, 71.4% gross margin, and $1.2 billion in operating cash flow, all best-ever levels for EA. 
Now what: Management is relatively optimistic about next year, with guidance for revenue growth of 7% to nearly $5 billion and an expectation that gross margin will continue to expand as more profitable digital order revenue continues to grow as a share of the mix. EA also expects its adjusted earnings to increase from $3.28 per share to $3.50 per share. 
Even as profitability continues to expand, the company continues to spend on R&D. It said operating expenses will increase $140 million to $2.1 billion next year, with investments in new franchises, mobile, its digital platform, and extending its partnership with other studios the primary drivers behind the increased spend. 
Despite the expectations of full-year growth, the company said to expect adjusted revenue in the first quarter to decline about 8% on an adjusted basis, largely because of game release timing and an extra week in last year's first quarter, though higher gross margin percent and higher GAAP revenue would offset higher operating expense, and keep GAAP earnings per share roughly in line with last year's quarterly result. As in prior years, much of the company's operating income and revenue will be driven in the second half of the year. 
Electronic Arts continues to take advantage of the growth in gaming, and relatively solid expansion of console sales over the past few years. From a valuation perspective, EA's stock is trading at a forward price-to-adjusted 2017 earnings ratio of about 22, which is probably reasonable, even with today's big increase. That's assuming, of course, that the company can deliver its 2017 results and keep growing sales and profits in the years to follow.

            ","Despite a deluge of earnings reports and fresh data on the health of the economy, stocks barely budged last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) both fell by less than one-half of a percentage point and remain slightly higher on the year so far:

Many individual stocks made much sharper moves last week, of course. And over the next few trading days investors could see significant price swings due to market-moving news from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),  Disney (NYSE:DIS), and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).
Monday, May 9 – Netflix tests its pricing power Monday marks the beginning of one of Netflix's largest price hike rollouts yet. Millions of U.S. streaming fans will be faced with the decision of either paying a few dollars more per month, switching to a lower-tier plan, or canceling their service outright. The options they pick will have a big impact on profit margins and ultimately on Netflix's ability to keep investing in content so that it can expand its service.

The choice should be easy. In the two years since it announced this pricing move, Netflix has added hundreds of hours of exclusive, original content, including recent hits like Marvel's Daredevil and the Making a Murderer series. There's a huge pipeline of big-budget series and movies on the way, too, including new-release Disney films that begin hitting Netflix servers in the Fall.
CEO Reed Hastings and his team aren't taking any chances, though. They plan to roll out the price changes slowly, all while testing different ways to communicate the shift.
Tuesday, May 10 – Disney talks ESPN, Star Wars, and China Entertainment giant Disney may have plenty of good news to report to investors this week. It's studio business is on a roll with recent surprise hits, Zootopia and The Jungle Book. The consumer products segment is likely to show another banner licensing quarter thanks to demand for Star Wars and Disney Princess items. Even the struggling media division could post steady growth as the TV advertising market picks up steam.

Besides those key operating updates, investors will be watching for any news on Disney's Shanghai theme park that's slated to take its first official guests next month. The theme park business will likely take a hit from pre-opening expenses tied to that resort over the next few quarters, but these aggressive bets should pay off for decades to come as Disney finally unlocks the turnstiles in the world's most populous country.
Tuesday, May 10 – Electronic Arts  Video game developer Electronic Arts is set to post its quarterly numbers after the market closes on Tuesday. It has a tough act to follow as main rival Activision Blizzard last week trounced expectations while boosting its full-year sales and profit outlook.

Both companies are benefiting from surging demand for digital gaming content that's making their operations both more profitable and less dependent on a handful of major video game launches. Instead, rounds of expansion packs and add-ons help keep gamers engaged in titles like Star Wars Battlefront long after the original release date.
Investors aren't expecting knockout revenue or profit improvements for EA this quarter. Consensus estimates call for flat sales and a minor uptick in profit of $0.42 per share, but that's mainly because the developer didn't have a comparable release to last year's Battlefield: Hardline in this period. EA should still have good news to report to shareholders on its profitability, and regarding its (likely aggressive) fiscal 2017 release calendar.

            ","Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens promo footage. Source: Lego
The first video game based on the seventh Star Wars film is coming this summer -- Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens is set to launch on June 28.
Disney's (NYSE:DIS) intellectual property has fueled many successful video game launches, including, most recently, Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) marquee first-person shooter, Star Wars: Battlefront, which played a key role in its 2015 lineup. Lego Star Wars could be similarly effective in driving Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX) video game business, which has been a source of growth for the media conglomerate in recent quarters.
Electronic Arts has partial exclusivityElectronic Arts signed a deal with Disney in 2013 for the rights to develop Star Wars-themed video games. Electronic Arts' management has emphasized the exclusive nature of the deal, but there's a major exemption: Disney retained the rights to Star Wars games aimed at casual audiences. Disney Infinity 3.0 Star Wars, released last August, is a perfect example. Its relatively simplistic gameplay and emphasis on physical toys endears it mostly to young children. Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens has no toy component but will more or less target the same group of players.
In contrast, Star Wars: Battlefront is aimed at core gamers -- those whose gaming habits generally center around such franchises as Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, and Madden. In January, Electronic Arts announced that it had sold 13 million copies of Battlefront into the supply chain. That was enough to make it the fourth best-selling video game of 2015 in the U.S., according to research firm NPD. The game was favorably received by critics but clearly benefited from the general Star Wars fervor permeating pop culture in 2015. Battlefront's marketing leaned heavily on the original Star Wars trilogy, and the company was careful to ensure its release coincided with the debut of the film.
Given that it owed Disney a royalty, Battlefront didn't offer Electronic Arts the same profit margin as some of its other games. Still, it played a key role in Electronic Arts' 2015 performance. The video game giant turned in a string of strong earnings reports last year and raised its guidance, due in part to the excitement surrounding Battlefront. That helped Electronic Arts shares outperform the S&P 500 over the last 12 months.

Data by YCharts
Battlefront should continue to reward EA shareholders, as the company plans to release several digital expansions. Moreover, analysts and investors may react favorably when Electronic Arts announces other Star Wars games, which have been confirmed but not officially unveiled.
Time Warner's growing video game businessIt would be surprising but not unprecedented if Time Warner's title sold similarly well. The company has been making Lego-themed video games for nearly a decade now, and though they aren't regularly among the best-selling games in the market, they do crack NPD's top 10 list from time to time. Most recently, in 2012, Time Warner's Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes was No. 9 on the list.
Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens won't have the benefit of being released close to the film's debut, but Disney will release The Force Awakens on disc and through digital download services next month, and rental demand could keep the movie in the minds of consumers for several months thereafter.
The Warner Bros. segment generated nearly $13 billion of revenue in 2015, with about 80% of that coming from its theatrical films and television shows. Its video games and other component contributed just $2.2 billion, or about 5% of Time Warner's overall revenue in 2015. Yet, to its credit, video games did make up the company's fastest growing business, surging 39% on an annual basis. Last year was the best ever for the video game business, and management expects the segment's growth to continue. ""I do believe that film and games will more than offset the difficult comp in TV, and we will have strong growth in 2016,"" said Warner Bros. head Kevin Tsujihara on the company's latest earnings call.
Time Warner has other games in the pipeline, but Lego Star Wars could be its most significant title of 2016.

            ","Image: Take-Two Interactive.
Businesses that have big cyclical ups and downs are tough to gauge, and investors in video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) found themselves in that position coming into Wednesday's fiscal third-quarter financial report. This year, Take-Two didn't have the new PlayStation 4 and Xbox One releases of Grand Theft Auto V that it had during the 2014 holiday season, and so many believed that the company would lag behind Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and other game-makers. Yet even though Take-Two's results did shrink from last year, they nevertheless crushed the low expectations that investors had for the game-maker. Let's take a closer look at Take-Two's latest results and how it defied negative expectations so effectively.
A close look at the numbers Take-Two Interactive's fiscal third-quarter results looked ugly compared to last year's performance, but they held up quite well given the different situation the company faced. Revenue plunged by nearly half to $486.8 million on an adjusted basis, showing just how big an impact the year-ago releases from the Grand Theft Auto, Borderlands, and Sid Meier's Civilization franchises had. Even with the drop, though, Take-Two's revenue was $34 million higher than the consensus forecast among investors. Furthermore, even though net income fell by more than half to just $99.7 million, adjusted earnings per share of $0.89 were extremely strong compared to expectations for just $0.50 per share.
Taking a closer look at Take-Two's numbers, the video game company cited existing titles Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K16, WWE 2K16, and the Borderlands series as the largest contributors to revenue. Sales from digitally delivered content jumped to $213.6 million, making up 44% of the company's overall revenue. Recurring revenue jumped 45% from a year ago, and Take-Two is now getting almost a quarter of its total revenue from recurring sources, as well as more than half of what it makes from digital-delivered content.
New releases didn't play nearly the same role they did in the year-ago quarter. Instead, content updates for existing games demonstrated the ongoing value proposition to Take-Two customers. In addition, expanding popular games for use on tablets and smartphones was an important event.
Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick was ecstatic about the company's performance. ""Take-Two enjoyed immense consumer demand for its recent releases and catalog,"" Zelnick said, ""enabling the Company to deliver another quarter of strong revenue, non-GAAP earnings, and cash flow."" The CEO also pointed to new record levels of recurring consumer spending as a sign of success for the company's business model.
Can Take-Two go into overdrive? Take-Two is also excited about its future game releases. As Zelnick said, ""we have an extensive development pipeline that positions our Company for revenue growth and margin expansion."" He cited the Friday release of XCOM 2 and fiscal 2017 launches for Mafia III and Battleborn that should also generate excitement.
The strong results prompted Take-Two to boost its guidance once again. The company now expects full year fiscal 2016 revenue of between $1.48 billion and $1.52 billion for the year, and it believes that it will see adjusted earnings of $1.65 to $1.75 per share, up from its earlier range of $1 to $1.15 per share. Fourth-quarter guidance for earnings of $0.15 to $0.25 per share on sales of $260 million to $310 million set the bar far higher than investors were expecting.
Nevertheless, Take-Two needs to be prepared for strong competition. Electronic Arts in particular has done a good job grabbing up valuable sports-related titles that go up against many of Take-Two's popular games. Still, there's room enough for both Take-Two and Electronic Arts to divide the spoils of a growing industry, especially as long as console makers remain committed to periodically refreshing their offerings over time.
Take-Two Interactive investors were happy with its performance, sending shares up 8% in after-market trading following the announcement. Even with a big contraction in results, Take-Two has set itself up for a strong future.

            ","Shares of video game giant Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) tumbled last week following a disappointing quarterly report. Although Electronic Arts managed to post strong earnings, both its revenue and its outlook fell short of expectations.
During the company's subsequent earnings call, CEO Andrew Wilson and CFO Blake Jorgensen spoke about the trends currently affecting Electronic Arts' business, its future plans, and its expectations for the industry. Here are five of the most important quotes from that earnings call.
Gift-giving weighed on digital downloadsIn recent years, Electronic Arts' management has repeatedly emphasized its desire to drive players away from physical discs. While the bulk of console video games continue to be sold in physical form, fully digital titles are now offered as an alternative. Electronic Arts' margins are better on digital sales, and it doesn't need to worry about the second-hand market cannibalizing demand.
The popularity of these so-called ""full game downloads"" has been trending up in recent years, and management has been optimistic it would continue at an accelerating pace. Digital downloads did rise during the third quarter, but demand was limited by a major cultural tradition: holiday gift-giving. During the call, Jorgensen addressed the topic.
""Full game PC and console downloads generated $195 million -- up 39% over the prior year -- driven by Star Wars: Battlefront, offset by [foreign exchange]. Star Wars: Battlefront was our largest digital launch ever, although it did lean more toward physical copies over the full quarter as holiday gift-giving became the dominant driver.""
A drag on marginsElectronic Arts exceeded its estimates for both earnings and during the quarter, but its gross margin fell short of its outlook. Jorgensen explained during the call.
""Our [adjusted] gross margin for the quarter was 70.4%, down from last year's 72.8% and [1.10%] below our guidance. The decrease from last year was driven largely by mix...[2014's key holiday title] Dragon Age: Inquisition...compared to the royalty-bearing Star Wars: Battlefront this year. We had factored into guidance our expectation that Star Wars: Battlefront would be a strong gift-giving title [and therefore sell many physical discs], but it skewed even more physical than we had anticipated. The other significant driver of the margin shortfall...was also a positive, the strong performance of our royalty-bearing console and mobile games, which triggered greater royalty expenses than expected.""
EA's future plansAs a video game publisher, Electronic Arts' results depend on its slate of upcoming titles. During the call, Wilson laid out Electronic Arts' plans for the next four quarters.
""Unravel launches on February 9...On February 23, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 goes live...Then on March 15...EA SPORTS UFC 2 set to debut...Looking ahead to [fiscal year 2017, which ends March 2017], we will introduce breakthrough games from some of our biggest and most popular franchises....Mirror's Edge Catalyst...in May. A great line-up of EA SPORTS titles are in development...An all-new Battlefield game...will arrive in time for the holidays, we're excited to have a new Titanfall experience coming...and...Mass Effect: Andromeda...will launch later in the fiscal year.""
The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are selling wellElectronic Arts' participates in almost all aspects of the video game industry, selling titles on virtually every platform, including PCs and mobile devices. But Electronic Arts remains dependent on the market for video game consoles -- a full 76% of Electronic Arts' adjusted revenue came from the sale of its games on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The later two were particularly important, generating about two-thirds of Electronic Arts' adjusted revenue. Fortunately, they're quite popular. During the call, Jorgensen noted the extent of their relative popularity.
""Our estimate is 55 million [PlayStation 4 and Xbox Ones] out there which has exceeded virtually everyone's forecast for the year, and [is] now almost 50% higher than [the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 at this point in their lifecycles].""
Star Wars developers are hamstrung by canonElectronic Arts sold 13 million copies of Star Wars: Battlefront into the sales channel last quarter. Although those players have already given Electronic Arts' some money for the game itself, they offer additional monetization opportunities through the sale of post-release, add-on digital content. However, while Electronic Arts' management remains committed to the game, it is limited in terms of what it can offer. During the call, Jorgensen offered up some details on the company's Star Wars deal.
""Part of our arrangement with Lucas...[we] can't make a game in [the] Star Wars [universe] that violates the canon of Star Wars...[We] can't take something from the future and bring it back into the past unless it's a reference. Not knowing yet exactly what the storyline in [the upcoming Star Wars spinoff film] Rogue One is going to be, I can't comment on how that could come into ...our current Battlefront game...which is [placed] 30 years before [Episode VII, so it] will limit our ability to bring some new content into that.""

Shares of video game giant Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) cratered last week following the release of its fiscal-third-quarter earnings report. Although Electronic Arts' earnings exceeded analyst estimates, its revenue and outlook proved disappointing. Electronic Arts earned an adjusted $1.83 per share on revenue of $1.8 billion. Analysts had expected the company to earn just $1.81 per share on revenue of $1.81 billion.
Overall, it was a strong quarter, but not as strong as many investors may have anticipated. Let's take a closer look at Electronic Arts' results.
Strong demand for Madden, Battlefront, and FIFAElectronic Arts' quarter was dominated by video game consoles. Sales of its Xbox and PlayStation games generated 76% of its adjusted revenue, with most of that coming from the newer Xbox One and PlayStation 4. It took two years, but it seems most gamers have finally moved on to the latest consoles. During the quarter, sales of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 titles generated two-thirds of Electronic Arts' adjusted revenue. The older PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 brought in just 10%. That's a massive swing from last year, when it was 41% and 29%, respectively.
In Western markets, Electronic Arts was the top publisher on both consoles in 2015. Electronic Arts' Madden NFL 16 was the best-selling sports title in the U.S., while FIFA 16 was the top-selling game in Europe. Electronic Arts' massively multiplayer online RPG, Star Wars: The Old Republic, saw its subscriber base rise to the highest level in three years. And Star Wars: Battlefront, Electronic Arts' highly anticipated, Star Wars-themed first-person shooter, sold more than 13 million copies into the supply chain, exceeding Electronic Arts' guidance.
Almost all of Electronic Arts' segments enjoyed revenue growth on an annual basis, with the lone exception of subscriptions and advertising. Adjusted revenue from packaged goods surged 36%, while full game downloads jumped 39%. Adjusted net income rose 54%.
Investors wanted moreSo why did Electronic Arts' shares tumble following the release of its earnings report? It may come down to recent trends and expectations.
For its fiscal year 2016, which ends in March, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $3.04 on revenue of around $4.5 billion. That's slightly worse than analyst forecasts of around $3.10 on revenue of $4.56 billion.

At the same time, its fiscal-third-quarter numbers look weak in the context of its recent past. Even factoring in last week's correction, Electronic Arts' shares have surged over the last two years, rising more than 180% since January 2014. That gain has been fueled by a steady stream of strong earnings reports -- the company has consistently blown away both analyst expectations and its own guidance. Here's what it reported in the last five quarters:
Electronic Arts' recent earnings report still exceeded analyst estimates for earnings but missed revenue projections. Moreover, it beat earnings estimates only narrowly -- unusual given its recent history. Under CFO Blake Jorgensen, Electronic Arts has given consistently conservative guidance, which it has managed to beat handily. In its October 2014 quarter, for example, Electronic Arts earned almost 50% more than it had projected.
Altogether, then, it's not surprising that Electronic Arts' shares sold off. Although the company's quarter was solid, investors simply expected more.

Video game companies rely on a constant parade of hit releases to drive interest, and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) has seen its fair share of successful games generate huge financial gains for the company. 2015 was a strong year for Take-Two, thanks largely to its release of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Grand Theft Auto V in late 2014 that gave the company a huge holiday season last year. Yet coming into its fiscal third-quarter report on Wednesday, Take-Two investors worry about the impact that not having a new blockbuster installment of its biggest franchise will have on its overall results. Moreover, competition from Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) remains fierce, and Activision Blizzard has outpaced gains in Take-Two stock over the past year. Let's take a closer look at how Take-Two Interactive has fared recently and what investors should expect in its earnings report on Wednesday.

Getting ready for a big earnings decline at Take-Two Investors have become more optimistic about Take-Two's earnings prospects in recent months, boosting their fiscal third-quarter projections by a nickel per share and giving nearly a 15% increase to their calls for the full fiscal year. The stock has held up well in a tough market environment, rising 4% since late October.
Take-Two's fiscal second-quarter results in November showed just how much of a game changer Grand Theft Auto V has been in recent periods. Revenue skyrocketed 175% from year-earlier figures, and Take-Two reversed a loss from the previous year's quarter in doubling the bottom-line earnings performance that investors had expected from the video game maker.
Take-Two has plenty of plans for future growth. Its sports franchises, such as NBA 2K16, offer the chance for recurring annual revenue as gamers seek the most recent lineups. Moreover, Take-Two has other games in the pipeline, including Battleborn and Mafia III, that could produce growth and give the company more diversification beyond its blockbuster Grand Theft Auto franchise. In late January, it announced that it would extend its partnership with WWE on wrestling-related content, offering both the WWE 2K16 game and new potential add-ons to the WWE SuperCard offering.
Yet Take-Two still lags behind competitors Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) in generating the sales that it needs to step up its game. In 2015, retail sales of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 finished in the top spot, and Electronic Arts took the No. 2 and No. 4 spots with Madden 16 and Star Wars: Battlefront respectively. Grand Theft Auto V and NBA 2K16 took the next two places, but it will likely prove tough for Take-Two to get past EA's sports franchises or to supplant Activision Blizzard's leadership role in the industry. That said, Take-Two has done a good job of tapping digital download channels to cut out retailer intermediaries and boost its margins, and that will be increasingly important going forward.
In the Take-Two earnings report, investors need to keep an eye on how the company's development pipeline is progressing. In the past, Take-Two's biggest booms have come when makers of game consoles upgrade their hardware offerings, and, unfortunately, the company won't benefit from refreshed new console models this holiday season. Now, Take-Two will have to find new ways to generate excitement in order to keep its stock moving in the right direction.

Friday gave investors a silver lining to what has been a stormy month. Major market benchmarks cut their losses thanks to action from Japan's central bank to stimulate economic growth, and the resulting surge of nearly 400 points for the Dow cut its losses for January to just 5.5%.
Even though investors generally found reasons to celebrate broadly, some stocks didn't join in the cheerful mood on Wall Street. Among them were Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Quality Systems (NASDAQ:QSII), and Moog (NYSE:MOG-A) (NYSE:MOG-B), all of which posted steep declines on the day.
Electronic Arts dropped 8% despite reporting adjusted revenue and earnings figures Thursday night that exceeded expectations. The company has capitalized on the success of its Star Wars Battlefront video game, and between other Star Wars-related franchises and key games like Madden NFL 16, Electronic Arts set a new record for quarterly operating cash flow.
Interestingly, some investors were disappointed that Electronic Arts sold so many copies of Star Wars Battlefront during the quarter, noting that it will potentially take game sales away from the current quarter. Moreover, even though Electronic Arts pushed its guidance for the full fiscal year upward slightly, it still fell short of the consensus figures among those following the stock. Going forward, Electronic Arts hopes it can sell more digital copies of games to keep costs down.
Quality Systems fell 19% after posting its fiscal third-quarter results Thursday night. The specialist in healthcare information technology suffered an unexpected sales decline, bringing in far-less revenue than investors had expected. Even though the company managed to meet expectations of investors in terms of earnings, future prospects aren't nearly as clear in painting a reliable growth picture.
Moreover, uncertainty about the impact of the recently completed acquisition of HealthFusion Holdings might also have weighed on shares, and it will be up to executives like newly named Chief Technology Officer David Metcalfe to find ways to improve the user experience for Quality Systems' customers. Until Quality Systems completes its restructuring and modifications of existing sales processes, the stock could have trouble making much headway.
Finally, Moog declined 16%. The maker of components for the aerospace, defense, industrial, and medical device arena unexpectedly saw revenue decline sharply, hurting the company's bottom line, and causing it to miss investor expectations. Even though the aerospace arena has generally been resilient in the face of global macroeconomic concerns, Moog saw weakness in its commercial and military aircraft-related sales.
It also took a hit from the struggling energy sector, in which the company no longer had the disposable capital to buy components for equipment. Moog expects an eventual rebound for its core businesses; but for today, investors weren't willing to wait for the long run to stay confident.

The Nasdaq 100 Index was one of the best-performing U.S. major market benchmarks in 2015, climbing more than 8% even before considering the positive impact of dividends. A big part of the reason for the Nasdaq's gains was its overweighting in highly successful tech stocks, many of which climbed substantially last year. Let's look at the 10 top-returning components of the Nasdaq 100 in 2015 and see what they can tell us about the market's future.

Big tech reigns supreme From the list and from the Nasdaq's outperformance compared to broader benchmarks, it's clear that technology played a key role in powering advances for the Nasdaq index. The continued dominance of Netflix and Amazon in their respective arenas impressed investors in 2015, leading both of those stocks to double from their end-of-2014 levels.
Yet Google parent Alphabet also climbed into the upper echelons on a return basis. Much of the positive reception came from the arrival of new CFO Ruth Porat, who was instrumental in organizing the reorganization of Google to create the Alphabet parent company. Stock buybacks in October also made investors happy, and the latter can expect more transparency about the other initiatives that the company has taken on, including things like its driverless car program and its investment arms.
Also among the doubling ranks was Chinese travel giant Ctrip.com, which made some smart strategic decisions to reach the pinnacle of its industry. Even as competition rose in the Chinese travel space, Ctrip managed to make the transition to the mobile-device realm very effectively, hitting 800 million downloads for its app before 2015 had even reached the halfway point. The decision to merge with rival Qunar eliminated a key source of potential difficulty for Ctrip, and now, many expect Ctrip to work more closely with other participants internationally to make the most of its leadership role in Chinese travel.
Winning the game The other area that shined in 2015 was the video gaming arena, where both Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts saw big gains. The most important contributor to that strong performance came from the move toward digital distribution, which has allowed both Activision and EA to bring in more revenue and widen profit margins. By cutting out retail intermediaries, Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard can release new games digitally, streamlining rollouts and getting games in front of its customers more quickly. Activision has done a better job of embracing digital releases, with about two-thirds of its sales coming from digital downloads, but Electronic Arts has moved aggressively to get its share from digital moving higher as well.
Key franchises also helped support share prices. For Activision Blizzard, the latest Call of Duty game generated its usual level of excitement, and other games like Destiny and Hearthstone also added to its overall success. The acquisition of King Digital promises even more expansion ahead for Activision. Meanwhile, Electronic Arts cashed in on Star Wars: Battlefront, jumping on the coattails of the massive franchise. Given the success of the new movie in the venerable franchise, Electronic Arts can expect even greater sales, with the digital delivery channel likely to post a big success for the game maker.
The Nasdaq 100 crushed the broader market in 2015, and these stocks were a big reason why. With favorable trends in video gaming and online travel continuing, many of these stocks could continue climbing over the course of this year as well.

EA data by YCharts
What: Shares of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) gained 46.2% in 2015 and fellow video game publisher Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) soared 92.1% higher, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. Meanwhile, video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) ended the year 17% lower. This trio provided a vivid illustration of how the game industry is changing, and what it takes to stay on top nowadays.
So what: Starting with the black sheep of the gaming flock, only 11% of GameStop's sales fall in the digital category. The rest comes from gaming systems hardware, collectibles, and the rapidly declining category of video games sold on physical media rather than direct downloads.
For Electronic Arts, 42% of its non-GAAP sales in the most recently reported quarter came from digital downloads. Fully 67% of Activision's sales spring from digital publishing.
The higher exposure to digital sales is not only keeping the game publishers relevant, but that more efficient distribution model is also lifting their profit margins. Meanwhile, GameStop is stuck trying to find a place in this evolving industry, and that's not easy.

GME EBITDA Margin (TTM) data by YCharts
Now what: I think it's telling that GameStop's fastest-growing division these days is its newly formed Tech Brands retail chain. That's a direct play on hardware sales in a bricks-and-mortar format, which runs against the grain of successful operations in this sector nowadays.
The game publishers are expanding their digital publishing schemes as quickly as possible, with a special focus on mobile gaming. EA is largely leaning on its own brands to create meaningful mobile revenue streams while Activision went on a mobile buyout spree in 2015. Either way, GameStop is starting to look like a quaintly obsolete dinosaur in a sector that really doesn't need a specialized strip-mall retail chain anymore.
Now, GameStop isn't going out of business anytime soon. The company is sitting on a $4.4 bilion stockpile of cash, roughly equivalent to its long-term debt, and can afford a few lean years. That being said, I think GameStop's management is barking up the wrong tree. Those physical retail stores aren't as valuable as they used to be because game shoppers are moving to online storefronts or downloads directly to their smartphones, tablets, and gaming consoles.
This is another golden age for content producers, just as much in the video game industry as in the more obvious TV and movie markets. And those winners are cutting out the middle man, like GameStop.

Disney (NYSE:DIS) is not the only one making money on the incredibly popular Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which had grossed more than $1.2 billion at the worldwide box office going into the final weekend of the year, racking up its first billion faster than any other movie.  Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is another company set to get a huge payday in the next few months through sales of its latest game, Star Wars: Battlefront, which was released in November, about a month before the movie hit theaters. There were some early concerns about the game, especially when GameStop (NYSE:GME) reported light sales a week following the game's release. However, here's why those concerns seem overblown and why EA is likely to report great Battlefront sales in its next earnings release.  
A new Force finally awakensLucasArts released the original Battlefront game in 2004, and Battlefront II in 2005. Then in 2012, when Disney purchased the Star Wars franchise, it signed the rights to produce the next installment of the Star Wars-themed video game over to EA. 
Now, 10 years after the last Battlefront game was released, EA finally released its own. EA's Star Wars: Battlefront, released Nov. 17, shows just how much the industry has changed in the last decade, combining the best of live, multiplayer online gaming with stunning graphics and features. EA said it expects to sell 13 million units in its fiscal year.  
Some early reviews of the new game were poor, reporting that it lacks original content. Unfortunately, one of the most important bears was GameStop. In GameStop's third-quarter results reported Nov. 23, management blamed missing earnings estimates on soft game sales, calling out EA's Star Wars: Battlefront as one game underperforming expectations. ""We had high expectations that diminished somewhat as it got closer, and then it failed to hit those lowered expectations,"" said GameStop COO Tony Bartel. 
Image source: EA
3 reasons EA's will post huge sales on this gameElectronics Arts COO Peter Moore said in early December that the game was still on track to meet the 13 million-unit goal. Here's why the game is likely to meet or exceed that 13 million sales goal and could be even more lucrative than you think. 
1. Digital sales: One reason GameStop's sales looked soft initially could have been that it is underestimating the shift toward digital sales, away from physical games that someone would buy in a GameStop store. That's bad news for GameStop, but good news for EA, which has said that Star Wars: Battlefront is the ""largest digital launch"" in its history.  
2. The Force Awakens' huge box office success: EA's Star Wars: Battlefront was released during a highly competitive time in the multiplayer online game market, with other big-name titles going on sale in the same month. Now that Star Wars: The Force Awakens has opened, notching the highest opening weekend of all time at nearly $250 million domestic and nearly $530 million worldwide, it's likely the excitement and positive reviews of the movie (currently 97% on RottenTomatoes.com) will drive more sales for EA's game as fans want more.    
3. Additional content on the way: For all of the reviews talking about how Star Wars: Battlefront was lacking in new content, what did they expect? The game was obviously unable to use the storyline, characters, or planets of Star Wars: The Force Awakens until the movie came out, so as not to spoil the movie. However, because of the digital nature of this game, it will be easy for EA to continue to add content that is likely going to be related to the new movie -- which is likely to continue selling units and subscriptions to the new content in 2016. It's been advertised that a ""season pass"" would include ""4 upcoming digital expansion packs filled with new content that will take you to new locations across a galaxy far, far away. ... The first expansion pack will be released in early 2016."" 
The Force is strong with this oneEA had a tough launch with Star Wars: Battlefront with some poor media around certain negative reviews as well as GameStop's comments on soft sales. However, with what we have heard from EA management about the scope of the game digitally, how well the new movie has performed at the box office and in reviews, and the ability for EA to continue pushing out new game-play content that it will charge customers for, it's likely that EA is going to make a killing on this game.

The proliferation of ETFs has arguably been the best trend for ordinary retail investors during the last decade. Because they are composed of many different stock holdings, ETFs offer investors instant diversification, much like mutual funds. However, ETFs generally offer this diversification with lower fees, more price transparency, and better tax efficiency.
However, you should still learn about an ETF and the niche it represents before you buy a share of it. This is especially important in the fast-moving technology field.
With that in mind, let's look at the top non-levered, non-inverse tech-sector ETF this week. With more than $200 million in assets under management and average-trading volume of 100,000 shares, this ETF outperformed the Nasdaq Composite's slight loss for the trading week ended Dec. 18.
A slightly better week for software Year to date, it's been a good year for software companies, and specifically, gaming companies (more on this later). Year to date, the Standard and Poor's North American Technology Software Index is up 12% versus the greater Nasdaq, which is up 4%. And this is another week of outperformance for the index, as the passive ETF that represents the index, iShares North American Tech-Software ETF(NYSEMKT:IGV), eked out a small gain of 0.3%, while the Nasdaq fell.
As for the ETF, the fund's expenses are a little high in relation to other iShares offerings, at 0.47%. For example, iShares recently cut expense ratios for seven of its ""core"" ETFs, bringing down the fee from 0.07% to an extremely cheap 0.03% in its S&P Total Stock Market ETF. As a passive, index-following ETF with more than $1 billion in assets under management, it stands to reason that this fund's fees are comparatively high to other iShares offerings.
How did the index overachieve?  As for the fund's slight gain, it appears to be from Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), which has a relatively large allocation of 4.5% of the ETF. Shares of the video-gaming company were up 2.7% this week, even including Friday's 3% drop, as ""the force"" was with the company. Specifically, investors seemed to give the company -- and its blockbuster new game Star Wars Battlefront -- another look, as positive reviews about the movie poured in.
The company recently cut the game's price, with The Wall Street Journal reporting the company saying the initial launch ""fell short"" of expectations. Investors are apparently hoping positive word-of-mouth from the movie will manifest itself in more game sales; but with a year-to-date gain of nearly 50%, many are able to forgive one bad game.
It was a good week for gaming companies, as Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) jumped 3.4%, as well, on news that the company's Destiny: The Taken Kingand Call of Duty: Black Ops III would receive more microtransactions, in-game level-ups, or weapons that allow gamers to more effectively compete -- and the company would be better able to monetize gamers post purchase. The company is roughly 4% of the ETF, so these two gamers account for nearly 9% of the ETF. And Activision has been a strong holding for the ETF, as the stock is up 90% this year.
The ETF's top holding, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), also helped with outperformance, as shares of the company also finished up, albeit slightly, on the week. In much the same was as Activision and EA are looking to monetize beyond the initial purchase with in-game transactions, Microsoft has been transitioning its host of software services to a recurrent subscription-based model. Investors have rewarded this large company to the tune of 17% this year, and the company comprises 10% of iShares North American Tech-Software ETF.

When Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) turns in its next earnings report (likely late next month) the performance of its recently released first-person shooter, Star Wars: Battlefront, will take center stage. The game, from Electronic Arts' acclaimed DICE studio, has garnered mixed reviews and has faced tough competition, going up against Activision-Blizzard's latest Call of Duty installment.
There's been some conflicting reports about Battlefront's performance in recent weeks, but management comments suggest that it sold at least as well as expected.
Battlefront is doing just fineEarlier this month, at Credit Suisse's TMT conference, Electronic Arts COO Peter Moore reaffirmed the company's guidance -- that Battlefront would sell 13 million units over the course of the company's fiscal year (which ends in March). Moore declared definitively that ""there is no weakness that is perceptible yet in the title,"" and went on to color his comments, remarking that ""based on where we think this title is, and based on the marketing beats ahead of us (in particular, the [launch of Star Wars: The Force Awakens]) over the next two weeks, we feel very comfortable we're going to hit the guidance that we've given.""
Moore's comments were in direct response to some remarks GameStop's (NYSE:GME) management had made on its quarterly earnings call in November. GameStop is the largest dedicated retailer of video games in the U.S., so any trends that it sees can provide insight into the performance of major video game publishers.
During that call, GameStop's own COO, Tony Bartel, said that ""Star Wars: Battlefront fell short of our expectations."" Later in the call he clarified his remarks, stating that ""we had high expectations that diminished somewhat as it got closer, and then it failed to hit those lowered expectations.""
Battlefront was only the third-best selling game in the U.S. during the month of November, according to research firm NPD. Call of Duty: Black Ops III outsold it, as did the critically acclaimed RPG Fallout 4. Third place is far from a poor performance, but it is a bit disappointing for a game that was so strongly anticipated.
Not taking digital into accountOf course, there's a major problem with NPD's numbers and with GameStop's results -- they don't take full-game downloads into account. NPD only tracks physical game discs sold at retail. GameStop, while it does offer full-game downloads, probably doesn't sell very many of them (assuming it sells any at all). Gamers who chose to purchase Battlefront digitally, directly through their consoles' dedicated storefronts, won't show up in either set of data. Indeed, in a blog post written earlier this month, Electronic Arts stated that the game was the ""largest digital launch"" in the company's history.
Among major publishers, Electronic Arts has been the most aggressive proponent of full-game downloads. Last year, the company's CFO, Blake Jorgensen, stated that the publisher hopes to eventually derive almost all of its revenue from digital channels. It's rolled out innovative programs, like EA Access, that encourage gamers to buy its titles digitally (EA Access subscribers receive a 10% discount on digital purchases).
Jorgensen has also been a critic of NPD. In an earnings call last January, he urged analysts not to take its findings too seriously. ""Be really careful using NPD data -- it's becoming less and less valuable as more and more of [our] business is going digital...It really underestimates the strength of our business,"" he said.
Looking ahead to 2017Although Battlefront is only one title, and its direct effect will be limited to just a few quarters, its performance could hint at some longer-term trends. Electronic Arts' Star Wars deal isn't limited to Battlefront -- the company intends to release a wide variety of other Star Wars-themed games in the coming years. If Battlefront sold poorly, it could suggest that gamers just aren't particularly interested in Star Wars.
But the opposite could also be true, and at the same time, Electronic Arts' slate of upcoming games is diverse. ""It's a little bit of an embarrassment of riches,"" said Moore, characterizing Electronic Arts' forthcoming titles. ""We've got some of our core franchises [coming in fiscal year 2017, including] a new Battlefield...a new Mass Effect...[and] Mirror's Edge.""
Electronic Arts' stock has been a winner for investors, rising nearly 400% over the last three years. Fears that Battlefront fell short of expectations have weighed on the stock in recent weeks, but based on management's outlook, the company seems poised to continue rewarding shareholders.

            ","Disney (NYSE:DIS) is set to release the first installment of Star Wars since buying the rights to the iconic characters in 2012 with its purchase of Lucasfilm for a cool $4 billion. Disney's nationwide release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens will hit theaters on Dec. 18, and industry insiders are expecting a record turnout for the flick. Some analysts have gone as far as to predict that Disney's new Star Wars film will be the highest grossing movie of all time.
Shares of Disney have rallied recently because of the market's excitement for its upcoming Star Wars film and subsequent Star Wars franchise. The hype has even taken attention away from Disney's broader problem of subscription losses in its ESPN business -- the company said it now has 92 million ESPN subscribers, down from 95 million in fiscal 2014. This should be a drag on the stock considering Disney's cable business accounts for as much as 45% of total operating income, but the media giant's upcoming Star Wars film has been a welcome distraction.
Disney's stock is up more than 11% in the past quarter, and currently trading north of $113 per share. Nevertheless, Disney isn't the only stock that could benefit from this Star Wars mania...
Tickets, toys, and video games... Oh my! Investors should take a closer look at some of the underdog stocks that stand to benefit from the Star Wars franchise as well. IMAX (NYSE:IMAX), for example, will see an influx of moviegoers this month when The Force Awakens hits its screens both nationwide and abroad. Disney expanded its relationship with IMAX ahead of the film's launch to include screenings from Lucasfilm, Pixar, and Marvel (all of which are owned by Disney) through 2017. IMAX currently boasts around 400 IMAX screens in the U.S., and an additional 400 overseas.
Image Source: IMAX.
The new Star Wars movie has already generated record advanced ticket sales in the U.S. -- producing around $50 million in sales more than a month before the film's debut -- and IMAX has reportedly raked in as much as a third of those advanced ticket sales. It makes sense that moviegoers would want to see this iconic flick on an IMAX screen. After all, this is a perfect fit for IMAX's large-format screens and advanced audio technology, as the Disney-backed Star Wars movie promises awe-inspiring special effects. Unlike other films opening around the holidays, Star Wars also comes with a loyal fan base that's been waiting more than a decade for another installment. This could cause many fans to pay to see the movie in theaters on multiple occasions .
As part of their ongoing arrangement, Disney is requiring IMAX and other multiplexes to play the film for at least a month straight -- that is two more weeks than typical arrangements between studios and movie theaters, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The Star Wars franchise is a big deal for IMAX, which is at the mercy of blockbuster hits in order to get viewers into its multiplexes. Shares of the specialty entertainment chain are down nearly 6% over the past six months. On top of this, as much as 18% of the outstanding shares are currently sold short; while that's not outrageous, it means plenty of investors are betting against the stock today.
If Star Wars: The Force Awakens is as big of a hit as many believe it will be, it would be a boon to IMAX's bottom line. The company takes a 10% to 15% cut of the gross box office sales, according to data from Morningstar. With a holiday film slate that includes the latest Hunger Games film, the most recent Bond installment, and the first Star Wars film to hit the big screen in 10 years, IMAX should have plenty of momentum heading into the New Year.
Don't under estimate the force of gaming GameStop (NYSE:GME) is another stock that's in need of a sales boost from the upcoming Star Wars bonanza. Shares of the video game retailer have been hit hard lately because of weak quarterly results and double-digit declines in the company's profitability. GameStop's stock has declined nearly 21% over the past six months, and currently trades around $33 a share.
GameStop spooked investors recently when it announced weak sales for Electronic Arts'(NASDAQ:EA) highly anticipated new Star Wars: Battlefront game. Shares of Electronic Arts fell more than 7% on the news last month. However, it is too early to tell how well these games will sell on a broader scale, particularly because the Star Wars movie hasn't even hit theaters yet.
Many analysts still expect big things from the sale of Star Wars video games. Commenting on Star Wars: Battlefront, Matt Titus, a portfolio manager at American Century Investment said the game had ""some of the strongest pre-orders in the history of gaming,"" according to Reuters. The upcoming release of the Star Wars film, together with the immense marketing efforts surrounding the Disney franchise, should undoubtedly boost sales of these video games.
This should help lift shares of both the world's largest videogame retailer and game publisher Electronic Arts in the quarters ahead. Electronic Arts is already projecting higher sales of its Battlefront title than it previous thought: the company now expects to move 13 million copies of the game through March of next year, up from its prior guidance for sales of nine million to 10 million units.
Not just a one-movie pony Importantly, these stocks shouldn't just get a one-time boost from Disney's Star Wars franchise, but could instead see years of seasonal gains. That's because Disney plans to release Star Wars-related films and character spin-off's annually for the next five or so years. This will give theaters, video game publishers, and gaming retailers plenty of Star Wars themed material to work with in the years to come.

With the holidays quickly approaching, savvy shoppers are looking for the best deals. Investors should be shopping now, too. After all, even with a strong rebound from late summer's market lows, the S&P 500 is still up only 4% in 2015 -- about half the historical rate of return. 
With that in mind, we asked five of our top contributors to give us their best stock ideas for December, and we got some compelling choices. The list includes well-known companies such as The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), little-known biotech Medivation (NASDAQ:MDVN), upstart car-buying service TrueCar (NASDAQ:TRUE), and a beaten-down former highflier in SolarCity Corp. (NASDAQ:SCTY). 
Does one of these stocks belong in your stocking? Keep reading to learn why our contributors think they should be on your list.
Jason Hall (SolarCity): SolarCity is an exciting business and a compelling stock to consider for those willing to take on some risk and a lot of volatility. Since peaking above $85 in late February 2014, the company's stock has fallen two-thirds, far more than two other big-name solar players, SunPower and First Solar:

SCTY data by YCharts.
However, the business has done incredible things. Since the end of Q1 2014, SolarCity has increased its contracted revenues from $2.5 billion to nearly $9 billion. That's stable, reliable cash flow that will be paid out over the next 20 years. Yes, the company has also increased its operating expenses significantly, but that's almost entirely a product of ramping up sales and marketing, and those investments -- as a percentage of sales measured in cost per watt -- are likely to decline sharply going forward. 
Here's the bottom line on what makes SolarCity a top stock to buy right now: Management has largely executed on the things they've committed to in the past, and they've made a commitment to moderate investment in growth to improve cash flows. The company is projecting to grow by 40% in 2016. That's a far cry from the 80%-plus growth we've come to expect, but it's still an enormous rate, and solar remains one of the most exciting growth industries out there. 
SolarCity isn't a risk-free stock. But with the risk, there is tremendous upside. The market has turned very negative on this growth stock, and now's a great time to buy for the long term. 
Steve Symington (Disney): I think investors would be wise to pick up shares of Disney this month. In particular, I know I'm not the only one excited by the financial promise of the Dec. 18 debut of Star Wars: Episode VII -- The Force Awakens. As the first cinematic fruit of Disney's $4.05 billion acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, Episode VII had already racked up more than $50 million in advance ticket sales by Nov. 19 -- double the previous $25 million record set by The Dark Knight Rises in 2012, and with almost one full month left for fans to claim their seat on opening night. And though Disney execs are unsurprisingly doing their best to temper expectations, it's no wonder some box-office pundits are speculating that Episode VII could ultimately eclipse Avatar's record as the highest-grossing movie of all time.

But investors also shouldn't forget to closely watch Disney's core Media Networks segment, consisting of its 80% stake in ESPN, 50% of A&E TV Networks, and full ownership of ABC Family and Disney's namesake channels. Last quarter, Media Networks represented 43.1% of Disney's total revenue, and 51.5% of total operating income, so it's clear that any miscues here could have an outsize negative influence on the company's overall results. At the same time, however, Disney specifically cited strength at ESPN for relative improvement in operating income during its fiscal-fourth-quarter report last month, largely silencing critics' concerns over cord-cutting as a primary antagonist in the near term.
In the end, if Disney can continue capitalizing on its enviable movie slate (which also includes upcoming blockbuster titles from Pixar, Marvel, and its namesake studios) while successfully navigating today's changing media landscape, I think investors who buy today will be handsomely rewarded in the process.
Brian Feroldi (Medivation): With 2015 coming to an end, I think it's a great time to scoop up shares of companies that are posting great quarterly results yet have only seen their stocks head lower. I think we have that exact situation happening right now with Medivation, a profitable biotech focused on treating cancer, which is why this company is my top idea for December.
Medivation's Xtandi has huge long-term potential. Source: Medivation.
Medivation stock has been on a tear for several years thanks to Xtandi, its treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Xtandi has been growing like gangbusters for years and shows no sign of slowing down; in the most recent quarter sales were up 73% in the U.S. and 116% in the rest of the world. These results allowed Medivation to show a strong quarterly profit, which is something that not many other biotechs can claim.
Xtandi is growing so quickly because it helps patients delay the need to start chemotherapy. In clinical trials, patients who used Xtandi went an extra 17 months before they needed to start treatment. Xtandi also lengthened patient survival by four months and meaningfully reduced the risk of death from the disease. Given that prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer, Xtandi appears to still have a long runway of growth ahead of it.
Despite all of its potential and stellar financials, shares of Medivation are down 38% from their springtime highs and shares are currently trading for about 23 times next year's earnings. I think that's simply too cheap for this high-quality company, so I think Medivation is a great stock to add to your December shopping list. 






Anders Bylund (Electronic Arts): In the summer, video-game veteran Electronic Arts seemed to have all the answers. In the capable hands of recently appointed CEO Andrew Wilson, the company hadn't missed an earnings estimate since the spring of 2013. Share prices doubled in 2014 and rose another 57% through the first seven months of 2015.

EA data by YCharts
And then the rocket fuel ran out.
EA shares have traded sideways since late July, despite beating two more earnings targets during this period. Investors seem to have painted the gaming industry with one huge brush, bundling outperformer EA into the same category as struggling game retailer GameStop. When GameStop fails (and that happens a lot these days), EA shares tend to struggle.
That's not at all fair, given that the same digital distribution trends that are undermining GameStop's traditional retail model also provide sales growth and wider margins for Electronic Arts. In short, EA's skyrocketing stock returns have taken a four-month break for all the wrong reasons.
The holiday season is already underway, and gaming business genius Andrew Wilson still runs this show. Chances are that EA's explosive growth will resume in January, when the final holiday-quarter numbers come in. Meanwhile, nobody knows whether the stock will continue to stall all the way into 2016.
For deal-hunting investors, there's no time like the present.
John Rosevear (TrueCar): I thought shares of online car-buying service TrueCar were a good buy back in September. But even though the company's share price has recovered somewhat since then, I think they might be an even better buy now. 
Here's the backstory: For TrueCar's business to work, it needs good relations with its car-dealer partners, but those relationships have been contentious for a long time. After a big public spat with giant dealer group AutoNation and a surprise second-quarter earnings miss, TrueCar's board lost patience. CEO Scott Painter, President John Krafcik, and top Vice President Larry Dominique all announced their departures. 
Krafcik and Dominique are respected auto-industry veterans. News that they would depart rattled investors: Were they fleeing a sinking ship? 

TRUE data by YCharts
But it's starting to look like TrueCar's board had a solid vision. The company's new CEO is Chip Perry, who built pioneering car-classifieds site AutoTrader from one employee into a strong, thriving business. Perry is well regarded among Silicon Valley investors, and -- importantly -- by car dealers.
Perry won't officially take over the role until Dec. 15, but he's already set out to begin mending TrueCar's relationships with dealers. He's promised dealers that TrueCar would ""earn back their trust"" and that he would improve the balance that TrueCar strikes between consumers' and dealers' needs. 
Perry says it's too early to share specifics on what he'll change at TrueCar. He'll need to draw a fine line between assuaging dealers and TrueCar's core mission, which is to improve the car-buying experience for customers. But his presence has already begun to stabilize this still-promising business, making it once again an intriguing investment.

            ","GameStop's (NYSE:GME) business model is broken, and the company has yet to find a solution.
Shares of the video game retailer plunged following the release of its third quarter earnings last week. New video game software sales -- GameStop's second-largest profit driver -- fell 9.3% on an annual basis. GameStop blamed a difficult comparison for the decline: last year's third quarter saw the release of Destiny, a much-hyped (though critically maligned) first-person shooter. The release of Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) Madden NFL 16, Metal Gear Solid 5, Halo 5, and Guitar Hero Live (among other games) were not enough to equal the demand for Destiny last year -- at least according to GameStop's management.
I've been a longtime GameStop bear and remain skeptical of the stock. The popularity of full-game downloads continues to increase, and GameStop's management is unable to address the threat.
Dodging the questionGameStop's business centers around the sale of video game discs, both new and used. Last quarter, 33.5% and 24.9% of GameStop's net sales came from new video games and used video games, respectively. GameStop sells new video game discs to consumers, and then buys them back later, only to resell them for a sizable profit. More than one-third of GameStop's total gross profit came from the sale of used games last quarter.
Source: GameStop third quarter earnings release
The continued shift toward digital downloads presents an existential threat to this model. If all (or most) video games are sold digitally in the form of a direct download, there's no disc for GameStop to sell (and then eventually resell).During GameStop's earnings call, Sterne Agee's Arvind Bhatia asked management what the company could do to crack into this market -- which, according to Electronic Arts, now represents about 20% of new game sales.
Bhatia: What do you think is your market share in digital downloads?...how do you become more of a destination place for digital downloads...?
GameStop CEO Paul Raines: I would say that, remember, that we are a player in digital downloads. I mean you don't do $228 million of digital receipts without having technologies, APIs, relationships, and all those things that you need to sell digital download...
GameStop COO Tony Bartel: Let me share some of that, Arvind. We don't give out specific market share of digital downloads or digital receipts, simply because it's really difficult to find that information. But let me give you some information from DFC...we find it to be one of the most credible source when we..look at digital share...According to DFC, in the third quarter, digital AAA sales for $60 game releases increased 6% over last year to 6% in total. And it represented only 9% of the total AAA sales mix. So that's coming from a source that we find very credible. So it grew 6% off of a very small base....
Raines: And you know the difficulty, of course, here is that digital is a complex animal and people, every publisher measures it in slightly different ways, et cetera... 
Bartel: ...And we anticipate that digital is going to continue to grow. And remember, that we grew 14% before [foreign-exchange], which is right in line with where the publishers grew. So we continue to see our digital continue to march forward at about the same rate that the publishers are seeing their digital growth.
In short: nothing. Rather than address Bhatia's question, GameStop's management stepped around it, offering no plan or strategy to capture demand for downloads. Instead, the company attempted to downplay the popularity of full-game downloads, and pointed to total digital receipts -- which is misleading. GameStop's digital business is composed of many different types of products, including pre-paid currency cards that can be used to purchase digital games through the various console storefronts, and Kongregate, its mobile game publishing platform.
The bulk of GameStop's digital business is likely coming from the sale of add-on (DLC) content. In recent years, major video game publishers have begun to supplement their games with additional downloadable content released several months after a game's debut. GameStop sells this content alongside physical game discs, encouraging customers who purchase a new game to pay for its DLC at the point of sale.
The issue is that these DLC sales are intrinsically linked to the demand for discs, and if gamers stop coming into GameStop's stores, there's no reason to believe this business will survive. I can't say for certain because GameStop won't disclose it, but I would assume it sells virtually no full-game downloads at all. There's simply no reason to purchase a full-game download through GameStop when you can just buy it through your Xbox or PlayStation console. To use an analogy, it would be the equivalent of going to Blockbuster to purchase a code for a digital movie you then redeem on iTunes -- an utterly nonsensical proposition.
Star Wars disappoints GameStop, but sets a digital recordEA's Star Wars: Battlefront wasn't included in GameStop's third quarter report, but will play a key role in its fourth quarter results. It made its debut earlier this month, and according to GameStop, suffered from soft sales. ""Battlefront fell short of expectations,"" said Bartel during the call.
But did it fall short of Electronic Arts' expectations? In a blog post released (perhaps not so coincidentally) shortly after GameStop's call, Electronic Arts wrote that the game was ""the largest digital launch in the history"" of the company. Rather than head to GameStop for their copy of Battlefront, gamers may have stayed home, purchasing it directly through their consoles.
GameStop is profitable, and pays a fairly sizable dividend (it currently yields more than 3.5%), but with so much of its sales and profit tied to video game discs, it remains immensely challenged.

            ","Brewer Constellation Brands was one favorite of this hedge-fund giant. Image source: Constellation Brands.
Many individual investors look to professional hedge-fund managers for ideas on smart stocks to buy. Lone Pine Capital has been a successful hedge fund for years, with Steve Mandel at the helm directing its investments. In its latest release of its holdings, Lone Pine revealed that it had made some big acquisitions, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). With Lone Pine having built up positions that were worth more than $1.9 billion at the end of September, individual investors can see evidence of Mandel's confidence in these three stocks. Let's look more closely at what Lone Pine did and whether these three stocks make sense for you.
Betting big on e-commerce Lone Pine's new position in Amazon.com is its biggest of the quarter, with the company building up a 1.94 million share position in the e-commerce giant. That made Lone Pine's stake in the company worth nearly $1 billion, making up more than 4% of its almost $25 billion portfolio of reportable holdings. Lone Pine has had investments in Amazon in the past, but they have tended to be opportunistic and short-term in nature.
Amazon has long been a controversial stock, as its revenue growth hasn't yet resulted in the level of profitability that many investors would prefer to see. Recently, Amazon has appeared to take steps to start remedying that situation, with the stock soaring more than 22% in October after the company reported more than half a billion dollars in operating income solely from its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing and web-hosting service. Investors have been willing to accept that Amazon's future promise justifies an ever-increasing share price even in the absence of more substantial profits, and Lone Pine appears to see the company as representative of the hedge fund's broader commitment to disruptive technology companies.
Brewing up big gains? Constellation Brands represents a more modest investment for Lone Pine, but the position that the hedge fund took involves a larger percentage of the beer and spirits-maker's market capitalization. Lone Pine bought more than 4.68 million shares of Constellation Brands, building up a 2.7% position that was worth more than $586 million at quarter-end. Unlike with Amazon, Lone Pine hasn't dabbled in Constellation stock in the past.
Constellation has moved aggressively toward building up its beer portfolio. After a major acquisition of brands Corona and Modelo in 2013, Constellation just announced the $1 billion buyout of craft-beer company Ballast Point Brewing. Ballast Point will add 40 beer brands to Constellation's lineup, including the well-regarded Sculpin India pale ale. Other major players have made big moves in the beer space lately, and Constellation hopes that greater exposure to craft beer will put it in better position to keep its competitive edge going forward.
Winning the game Lone Pine's investment in video game manufacturer Electronic Arts wasn't a new purchase, but the hedge fund dramatically increased its stake. Lone Pine's purchase of nearly 8 million shares during the quarter brought its total holdings to 8.78 million shares, and the shares that the hedge fund bought was worth about $541 million at the end of the quarter.
EA has profited greatly from long-running franchises like Madden NFL and other sports-related games, but a lot of the buzz surrounding the video game maker lately has come from its latest installment of its Battlefield series, which incorporates a licensing agreement that allowed it to take place in the Star Wars universe and was released in mid-November. Given the upcoming release of new movies in the Star Wars franchise, EA expected huge demand for the game, and many investors immediately concluded that Star Wars: Battlefield would become a multiyear success with plenty of potential for future sequels. The company is being smart about managing those expectations, but EA could nevertheless enjoy nice gains riding Star Wars coattails.
Lone Pine's buys are diverse and show the scope that Mandel and his team have in looking for good prospects. Each of these three stocks looks promising and could fit well in the stock portfolios of many individual investors.

            ","Shares of video game publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA)  fell after retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) reported weak third-quarter earnings on Nov 23. GameStop stock plunged as much as 16% that day, while EA stock slid about 6%. It might seem logical to dump a game publisher's stock after a major game retailer misses earnings expectations, but it doesn't really make much sense due to the differences between physical and digital distribution.

How bad was GameStop's quarter?Last quarter, GameStop's revenue fell 3.6% annually to $2.02 billion and missed estimates by $120 million. Net income fell 11.4% to $57 million, or $0.54 per share, which missed expectations by $0.05. Same-store sales declined 1.1% annually, compared to an increase of 8.1% in the second quarter.

At first glance, it looks like sales of consoles and video games are falling across the board. However, console sales were expected to slow down, since the PS4 and Xbox One have both been on the market for two years. Sales of physical software were also expected to fall, due to the growth of digital distribution channels. GameStop's digital games revenue also shouldn't be considered a bellwether for the digital market, since many gamers download games directly from the PlayStation Store, Xbox One Game Store, or Steam.
Simply put, customers buy consoles from GameStop, but they gradually lose touch with the retailer as the hardware ages. These customers then cut GameStop out of the sales loop by buying games through other digital distribution channels. GameStop is trying to counter this trend by offering more digital downloads and diversifying into consumer electronics, but those businesses still generate a small percentage of its overall revenue.
Why EA is differentUnlike GameStop, Electronic Arts has made a fairly smooth transition to the digital gaming model. Last quarter, non-GAAP packaged goods revenue (58% of sales) fell 13% to $666 million, but digital revenues (42% of sales) rose 6% annually to $480 million. Sixteen percent of those digital revenues came from full game downloads, 42% came from extra content like DLCs, 17% came from subscriptions and advertising, and 25% came from mobile games.
EA earned 74.5% of its revenues from consoles during the quarter. In addition to selling digital games through the PlayStation and Xbox One Stores, it recently partnered with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to deliver cloud-based games to TVs via its X1 set-top boxes. That partnership enables Xfinity subscribers to use a mobile device as a controller to play EA games streamed over the Internet. Last year, EA introduced EA Access, a subscription-based service which grants Xbox One gamers unlimited access to select titles. These initiatives will ensure that digital revenues flow from living rooms back to EA.

On PCs, EA sells its digital games through Origin, a Steam-like DRM platform which has over 50 million users. By keeping its games within this walled garden, EA maintains tighter control over pricing. It is also reportedly planning an EA Access-like subscription service for Origin. EA's PC/browser revenues accounted for 14.4% of its sales last quarter.
EA's total non-GAAP revenues fell 5.7% annually last quarter to $1.15 billion, which still beat estimates by $50 million. That slowdown wasn't surprising, due to currency headwinds and tough comparisons to last year, when The Sims 4 launched. But looking ahead, EA expects a strong holiday quarter thanks to the launch of Star Wars: Battlefront. For that quarter, EA expects non-GAAP EPS of $1.75 on revenue of $1.78 billion, which exceeds the consensus estimate for EPS of $1.73 on $1.75 billion in revenue.
Comparing apples to orangesGameStop and EA run on very different business models: Sluggish sales of new hardware and software at GameStop doesn't mean that sales of all games are sliding -- it just means that the distribution model is changing.
This doesn't necessarily mean that EA is an ideal investment at current prices. EA has high expectations for the holiday quarter, but the period could still be rough on margins due to steep discounts and the aggressive bundling of top games with new consoles. However, investors shouldn't sell EA simply because GameStop had a rough quarter.

            ","Video game giant Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) posted strong fiscal second quarter results, beating both its own guidance and analyst expectations. Yet shares fell following the release, as its outlook may not have been as optimistic as investors anticipated. During the subsequent earnings call, CEO Andrew Wilson, CFO Blake Jorgensen, and COO Peter Moore commented on a number of trends affecting the business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that discussion.
A different strategy for mobile gamesThe bulk of Electronic Arts' business continues to come from more traditional gaming platforms -- consoles and the PC. But Electronic Arts does have a respectable mobile business. Mobile games generated around 10% of its revenue on an adjusted basis last quarter. During the call, Wilson discussed a strategic shift the company made this quarter and how it affected one of its more popular mobile titles:
Madden NFL Mobile launched a full-game update this year instead of a new app download. The result was a seamless experience for players, which increased retention and resulted in game sessions up more than 300% over last year.
Demand for EA Access is risingLast July, Electronic Arts announced EA Access, a digital subscription service that gave Xbox One owners the ability to, for a flat monthly or annual fee, play a collection of older Electronic Arts titles. EA Access subscribers also get a discount on new releases and early access to upcoming games. However, Electronic Arts has not offered up exact subscriber figures, instead lumping it with its subscriptions and advertising revenue. That figure contracted slightly on an annual basis last quarter, from 91 million to 83 million on an adjusted basis, but EA Access may not have been responsible for that decline. During the call, Wilson commented on the service's growth in general:
EA Access is accelerating. The subscriber base more than doubled in the last two quarters. We've added five new games to The Vault this year, and we're excited about what we're learning as players engage through this service. These titles ... are giving us strong momentum moving into the holiday season.
On guidanceElectronic Arts raised its guidance for its full fiscal year, but its revenue outlook fell slightly short of analyst estimates. Mirror's Edge Catalyst was expected to debut in Electronic Arts' fiscal fourth quarter, but it has been delayed until May, shifting it out of the fiscal year. During the call, Jorgensen explained Electronic Arts' outlook:
Due to our continued strong performance, we are again increasing our full-year outlook. The open beta for Star Wars: Battlefront was exceptionally well received by players. Consequently, we're raising our unit forecast for sell-in during fiscal year 2016 to approximately 13 million units. This is partially offset by increased FX headwinds and our decision to move Mirror's Edge Catalyst into fiscal 2017.
The popularity of full-game downloads is increasing but not in every regionElectronic Arts' console games are its largest segment by revenue. Console games are still sold primarily on physical discs, but in the past, management has expressed its interest in eventually converting entirely to digital. Owners of modern consoles have the option to download games rather than buy a disc. During the call, Jorgensen commented on the trends the company is seeing in full-game downloads.
Our new titles in the quarter averaged around 20% full-game downloads with the exception of FIFA, which skewed lower [because of its European popularity]. ... In terms of the full-game downloads, a couple things to remember; we still sell [PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 games], and [gamers who own those consoles] are typically doing full-game downloads [less often]. ... Second, our [second-quarter] business, particularly FIFA, is skewed heavily toward Europe, and two factors bring down full-game downloads ... in Europe. One is bandwidth speeds in some countries. And two is many retailers in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, use FIFA as a way of driving traffic into the store, and they like a physical copy to help do that. We're seeing very strong full-game downloads continue in North America. ... [For PC games] we see full-game downloads there roughly 75%. ... We believe in the full-game download opportunity for us going forward.
Battlefront 2 in 2016?Electronic Arts will release Star Wars: Battlefront on Nov. 17. It should be one of the most popular games released this year. Could it become an annual franchise for Electronic Arts? During the call, Wilson commented on that possibility, suggesting that it probably wouldn't be the case but that the company's commitment to Star Wars is only just beginning.
Around Star Wars and annualization -- again, what we have talked about is we have a long-term partnership around the Star Wars license, and we expect that we will launch many titles as part of that long-term relationship. ... We still have 6 million people engaging regularly in both Battlefield 4 [released in 2013] and Battlefield Hardline [released earlier this year]. ... We think about our business not just as a launch business, but as a large service and relationship business that we factor in when it's appropriate to launch new things. ... Certainly, expect more Star Wars titles from us, but no decision made as to specific timing as yet.

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) shares were down 4% at 10:55 a.m. Friday following the release on Thursday of the video-game giant's fiscal-second-quarter earnings report. Electronic Arts earned an adjusted $0.65 per share on adjusted revenue of $1.146 billion.
Both figures handily beat analyst expectations. Wall Street had been expecting Electronic Arts to earn around $0.45 per share on sales of around $1.10 billion. Let's take a closer look at Electronic Arts' results.
Raising guidance -- againThe negative response to Electronic Arts' earnings report may have been predicated on the company's outlook. Although Electronic Arts raised its full-year outlook for the second time this year, it still fell slightly short of analyst estimates. For fiscal year 2016, which ends next March, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $3.00 per share on revenue of around $4.5 billion. Analysts had projected Electronic Arts to earn less (around $2.96 per share), but bring in more revenue -- around $4.53 billion.
Next quarter, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $1.75 per share on adjusted revenue of around $1.775 billion. Analysts had been anticipating earnings of around $1.74 on revenue of around $1.74 billion.
It's worth noting, however, that Electronic Arts' management has been particularly conservative in recent quarters, guiding to numbers that they seem to always handily beat. This quarter, in particular, Electronic Arts crushed its own estimates -- its adjusted earnings per share of $0.65 was well above its $0.40 guidance, while its adjusted net revenue of $1.146 billion was a bit more than its $1.075 billion forecast. Despite the decline, Electronic Arts' shares are up more than 200% in the last two years. Investors may have simply expected more from a company that's been firing on all cylinders.
Dominating the next generationIn the West, Electronic Arts has been the top publisher on both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One this year. Electronic Arts drew particular attention to its annual sports franchises to explain its success -- in particular, strong demand for FIFA and Madden NFL have benefited the company. This quarter, Electronic Arts released three sports titles -- NHL 16, FIFA 16, and Madden NFL 16 -- and monthly average players for the three titles rose 30% on an annual basis.
Revenue from the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 rose 48% on an annual basis, although demand for Electronic Arts' titles on older platforms saw a similar decline. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 revenue declined 43%, and those consoles now generate less than one-third as much adjusted revenue for Electronic Arts as their successors. Adjusted console revenue in total rose 5% on an annual basis.
Electronic Arts' PC revenue also notably declined, falling 38% on an adjusted basis. This was likely due to the release of the Sims 4 last September -- this year, Electronic Arts had no similar PC title, making a comparison difficult. Adjusted mobile revenue experienced a slight decline, falling 6%.
Digital takes a larger slice of the pieElectronic Arts' sales from digital channels -- as opposed to physical game discs by traditional retailers -- climbed to 42% of Electronic Arts' adjusted revenue, from 37% in the same quarter last year. Full-game downloads were flat, at 8%, but sales of extra DLC rose to 17% of adjusted revenue (from 13% last year), and packaged goods fell to 58% (from 63% in the same quarter last year). The move to digital is beneficial for the company's margins, and Electronic Arts executives have previously said they intend to eventually derive 100% of their revenue from digital channels.
Overall, it was a fairly boring quarter for the company -- not particularly phenomenal or discouraging. Next quarter, with the important holiday shopping season and the launch of Star Wars: Battlefront, should be more interesting.

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is about to release what could become the best-selling video game of the year.
Star Wars Battlefront is a first-person shooter from Electronic Arts' DICE studio, the longtime maker of the popular Battlefield franchise. It's slated to make its retail debut on Nov. 17, about one month before the release of next Star Wars film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Given the fervor currently surrounding all things Star Wars, Battlefront seems likely to smash Electronic Arts's expectations, which have been fairly modest.
Around 9 million or 10 million copiesTo date, management's guidance for Battlefront has been conservative. In May, CFO Blake Jorgensen said Electronic Arts expected to sell around 9 million to 10 million copies of the game, based on the relative success similar titles have had in the past.
Battlefield doesn't carry the Star Wars branding, but it offers a similar experience -- both games are team-based, first-person military shooters. Generally, those games sell around 15 million copies. Some Battlefield players could be turned off by the science fiction theme of Battlefront, but many longtime Battlefield players seem likely to convert.
The other game worth keeping in mind is the original Star Wars: Battlefront. That game was released in 2004, about eight months before the release of the film Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. It was made by a different game studio, released by LucasArts, and was a slightly different sort of game (a third-person shooter), but it does offer some hints as to what level of success can be expected from this new Battlefront. It sold 9 million copies.
In July, Electronic Arts raised its full-year guidance. Management said Battlefront played a key role in that shift, but declined to update its expectations in terms of unit sales. Notably, Battlefront will be exclusive to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC -- owners of the older Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles will not be able to play the game. Unfortunately, that may eliminate many potential buyers. But not too many.
Demand for Star Wars has been unprecedentedTwo years after their debuts, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have combined to sell perhaps 40 million units (the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 25 million; Xbox One sales have not been officially confirmed, but estimates peg the number at between 10 million and 15 million) and millions more may be sold this holiday shopping season. In March, Electronic Arts released the most recent installment in the Battlefield series, Battlefield: Hardline. According to the company, about 80% of the game's sales were for the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One platforms.
Star Wars mania has undeniably pervaded popular culture, and the game should benefit from the release of the latest film. Ticket sales for The Force Awakens have already smashed existing pre-sale records, and some analysts expect the film to eventually generate as much as $2 billion worldwide. Fans excited from watching the latest trailer could turn to Battlefront to satisfy their Star Wars itch in the weeks leading up to its launch.
There's other evidence to suggest Battlefront should perform exceptionally well. Earlier this month, Electronic Arts ran a test of the game's servers, allowing players to try the game for free. It wasn't meant to advertise, but rather ensure that Electronic Arts' online infrastructure could support it. Over 9.5 million players participated -- more than any other beta test in Electronic Arts' history -- with two-thirds achieving the max level cap (suggesting they had invested at least several hours). This was particularly impressive given that the game was only available to play for a few days.
Electronic Arts continues to reward shareholdersElectronic Arts shareholders could be rewarded for Battlefront's success before the game is even released. The video game publisher will report its quarterly earnings Thursday afternoon, and it could raise its guidance even further to reflect heightened excitement around Battlefront.
To be fair, Battlefront does face some tough competition this fall -- both Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and Halo 5 will offer first-person shooter fans strong alternatives -- but based on the excitement around the revival of the film franchise, there's every reason to expect the game to be a massively popular seller.

            ","Source: Activision Blizzard.
It's been five years since Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) hung up its stringless six-string, but it's never too late to start strumming again. Guitar Hero Live hits stores on Tuesday, and with that comes the hope that musical-timing games rock back into fashion. 
Activision Blizzard had a hit on its hands a decade ago. It was the publisher for the original Guitar Hero, developed by RedOctane and Harmonix in 2005. It liked what it saw, snapping up RedOctane two years later. Harmonix would go on to be acquired by MTV Games, turning to Activision Blizzard rival Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) to distribute its competing Rock Band franchise. 
Gamers ate up the niche, for a few years at least. Players took to guitars, microphones, and faux drum kits as controllers. Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts were the toast of the town. The genre breathed new life into the gaming market at a time when the Wii was already getting gamers to stand up and move. Small-box specialty retailers may have resisted at first. They had to give up shelf and storage space that was once dedicated to new and secondhand games to make room for bulky plastic guitars and drum kits. However, once the games started selling and crowds started to gather to watch folks play air guitar, it helped spark a retail revolution. 
By the time Activision Blizzard seemed to have milked the last bit of amp juice out of the franchise, it had spawned six generations of the game, as well as the short-lived DJ Hero and Band Hero spinoffs. Sales peaked in 2008, and by the time that the final entry rolled out in 2010 it was a fair bet that we would never be collecting guitar controllers again.
Well, that can all change on Tuesday. Guitar Hero Live is an evolutionary upgrade, offering an enhanced live concert experience. There are dozens of songs to cycle through, and folks can go online for roughly 200 more freely available tracks to play. If you're eyeing an opportunity to reconnect with all of the old Guitar Hero controllers collecting dust in your closet, you're out of luck. Guitar Hero Live features a totally new six-button fret interface. 
If this is a hit, we're talking about a lot of money spent on new hardware, and Activision Blizzard can certainly use that. Its revenue peaked in 2012. With once iconic franchises including Skylanders, World of Warcraft, and Guitar Hero sliding in popularity, it would be a real game changer if it's able to give its guitar-pecking series a second act. 
It's throwing plenty of marketing muscle behind the move. It's taking a page out of the Electronic Arts playbook by bringing in celebrities to pump up excitement. The promotional trailer stars Lenny Kravitz and James Franco in an amusing exchange. It's not the massive mini-movie effort that Electronic Arts used two months ago in trying to generate buzz for Madden 16, but it's a smart approach.
The game's coming. Now it's time to see if the encore is worthy of a standing ovation.

            ","Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) management had a lot to say on the company's first quarter earnings call.
CEO Andrew Wilson, CFO Blake Jorgensen, and COO Peter Moore commented on a variety of factors affecting Electronic Arts' business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that call.
More games are coming to the vaultLast year, Electronic Arts announced EA Access, a subscription-based digital service that gives Xbox One owners access to a variety of older Electronic Arts games for a relatively modest fee. Unfortunately, Electronic Arts does not break out the number of subscribers it has to the service, but during the call, Jorgensen highlighted the company's continued commitment.
""EA Access is delivering strong, sustained growth, and we continue to build its value to gamers as we add more games to the Vault. Titanfall is now in the Vault and Dragon Age: Inquisition will join it at the end of the summer, bringing the total titles to 13.""
Sims 4 and foreign exchangeElectronic Arts shares fell in after-hours trading on Thursday following the release of its first quarter results. Although they exceeded analyst expectations for the current quarter, its outlook fell short. During the call, Jorgensen offered up an explanation.
""Guidance for our second quarter is for [adjusted] net revenue to be $1.075 billion, 12% lower than last year's $1.22 billion. In this quarter, we're launching Madden NFL, FIFA, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, NHL and NBA Live. While last year's Q2 saw the launches of our major sports titles, it also included The Sims 4. In addition, FX presents a year on year impact of around $100 million to Q2 revenues.""
A strong slate of upcoming titlesAs a video game publisher, Electronic Arts' performance depends on the demand for its games. During the call, Wilson outlined several of the company's long-term projects.
""Looking further ahead, we're preparing more new games for our players. The reaction to a first look at Mass Effect: Andromeda at E3 was incredibly positive. We have a new Battlefield experience coming in Q3 FY 2017 and another new Star Wars project""
Star Wars will be a major part of EA's futureStars Wars: Battlefront could be the biggest game Electronic Arts releases this year. The first-person shooter is based on the long-running sci-fi series and is set to arrive in stores this November, ahead of the release of the next Star Wars film. But Electronic Arts' commitment to Star Wars involves much more than one game. During the call, Jorgensen hinted at additional titles.
""We don't have the timetable yet to announce those, but trust that you will see multiple Star Wars titles both on console and PC, as well as on mobile. We have at least one mobile title that's going to come out this year and we have more in the process as well. So lots to come on Star Wars, and you'll hear about that as we discuss our future guidance. We're very excited about the franchise and about our partnership.""
Free-to-play Titanfall probably won't be a big profit driverElectronic Arts released Titanfall for the Xbox One and PC in March of last year. An Xbox 360 version soon followed. Titanfall isn't a completely traditional first-person shooter, but it does adhere to traditional pricing -- if they wish to play it, gamers must pay to purchase it. But Electronic Arts will soon release a free-to-play version of Titanfall in Asia. When asked about this development, Moore made no sweeping promises. Instead, he characterized it as an experiment -- not a major new source of revenue.
""Think of this as a classic free-to-play game there, but do not think of this as being particularly material to revenue. It's an interesting experiment in looking at that type of game and whether it plays in a free-to-play environment. We'll be interested to see the results.""

            ","Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) cable box is now a video game console.
After months of speculation, the cable giant has officially unveiled its partnership with Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). Using a Comcast Internet connection and Xfinity X1 set-top box, customers can stream select gaming titles over the Internet to their televisions. Although the partnership may not disrupt the current console gaming landscape in the near-term, it represents an interesting new market and an opportunity -- both for Electronic Arts and for Comcast.

Comcast's cloud-based set-top box adds a new featureComcast's X1 set-top box is among the most advanced in the industry. Initially unveiled in 2012, the X1 supports voice commands, offers a cloud-based DVR and personalized recommendations, and can run third-party apps, including Pandora. Comcast's management has said it planned to improve the X1's features over time. Xfinity Games stands as the latest, and perhaps most significant, upgrade.
Players can choose from a catalog of select Electronic Arts titles, including Plants vs Zombies, FIFA 13, and NBA Jam. Games are played using tablets or smartphones connected over Wi-Fi rather than with standard controllers. Comcast's X1 isn't capable of actually running the games -- they're played on distant servers, then beamed over the Internet to subscribers' set-top boxes.
A way to stem subscriber losses?Currently, Comcast is offering the service for free to select participants in its beta test. That might eventually change to a model built around subscriptions.
Alternatively, Comcast could see additional revenue from increased data usage. On its Xfinity Games website, Comcast makes it clear that games streamed over its network count toward customers' Internet data caps. Comcast's cap varies based on region -- and it doesn't enforce a cap everywhere -- but where it is enforced, it charges an additional $10 per month for every 50GB used above the cap.
Xfinity Games could also serve as a way to keep Comcast's cable subscribers loyal. Earlier this month, Comcast revealed that it now has more Internet subscribers (22.6 million) than cable TV customers (22.3 million). Streaming video services and Internet-based, pay-TV alternatives have made living without cable an increasingly viable option. Those who want to take advantage of Xfinity Games, however, will need a Comcast set-top box and pay-TV subscription.
A new market for Electronic Arts' gamesFor Electronic Arts, Xfinity Games offers up a new avenue for revenue beyond its traditional console, PC, and mobile offerings. Electronic Arts has not disclosed how much Comcast is paying for the service, but may shed some light on the deal later this week when it turns in its quarterly earnings.
This service is not likely to affect Electronic Arts' results to a material degree in the near future, but if Xfinity Games proves popular, it could open up a new market. As it stands, Electronic Arts is limited in its ability to sell television-based games to those with relatively expensive game consoles. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 have sold tens of millions of units globally, but the majority of American households don't have either box. Some of those are undoubtedly Comcast TV subscribers who could be lured by the company's latest offering.
Last year, Electronic Arts launched EA Access, the first subscription-based game offering from a major publisher. Partnering with a cable provider to offer streaming games is another first for Electronic Arts and the industry in general. If nothing else, Xfinity Games demonstrates the increasing degree to which Electronic Arts' management is innovating.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) shares fell in after-hours trading on Thursday following the release of the company's fiscal-first-quarter earnings report. Although Electronic Arts beat analyst expectations for the current quarter, its outlook for the second quarter and full year proved disappointing. Let's dig in to Electronic Arts' report.
A strong quarter despite an empty release scheduleAs a video game publisher, Electronic Arts depends on the sale of its games to drive its financial performance. But the majority of Electronic Arts' titles are released in the fall and winter; in the first quarter, Electronic Arts published no new games of note.
Still, it earned an adjusted $0.15 per share on adjusted net revenue of $693 million. Analysts had expected Electronic Arts to earn just $0.03 on revenue of around $652 million. Management cited demand for games released in prior periods, as well as revenue related to its digital services.
Packaged goods -- physical CDs -- generated just 23% of Electronic Arts' adjusted net revenue in the first quarter, down from 38% in the same quarter last year. Full-game downloads rose to 12% from 9%, while DLC (downloadable content) grew to 37% from 27% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. Subscription-related revenue remained stable at 10%, and mobile revenue grew to 18% from 16% in the same quarter last year.
Given the lack of new titles in the first quarter, Electronic Arts focused on its upcoming slate. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in June, Electronic Arts' upcoming games won a combined 132 awards. Although these rewards mean little in terms of financial performance, they serve to underscore the relative strength of the company's pipeline.
But EA's outlook falls shortThursday's sell-off was likely fueled by Electronic Arts' outlook. Although it raised its full-year guidance, it still fell short of what analysts had been anticipating.
In fiscal year 2016, which ends in March 2016, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $2.85 per share on adjusted net revenue of $4.450 billion. Analysts had projected $2.87 per share on revenue of around $4.48 billion. More significant is Electronic Arts' second-quarter outlook. In that quarter, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $0.40 per share on adjusted net revenue of $1.075 billion. Analysts had expected quite a bit more -- $0.67 on revenue of $1.12 billion.
If recent history is any indication, Electronic Arts' guidance is likely extremely conservative. Electronic Arts' results exceeded management's expectations in every single quarter of its fiscal year 2015. In the fourth quarter, for example, Electronic Arts had guided for adjusted earnings of $0.22 per share on adjusted net revenue of $830 million. In reality, Electronic Arts earned an adjusted $0.39 on adjusted net revenue of $896 million. 
In recent quarters, Electronic Arts has been one of the best-performing tech stocks. Shares of the video game giant are up better than 100% in the last 12 months. The rally has been fueled by a steady stream of better-than-expected earnings reports -- in January, and again in May, shares surged following the release of quarterly results that exceeded expectations.

EA data by YCharts.
Demand for next-generation consoles has been strong, and Electronic Arts' multiple has risen along with its stock. With a trailing price-to-earnings ratio near 26, investors appear to be expecting strong growth.
The sell-off is a minor speed bump for longer-term shareholders, but not particularly surprising. Electronic Arts' business continues to perform, but given its valuation, any doubts about its future prospects will likely weigh on its shares.

5 Big Winners, data by YCharts.
The stock market is having a quiet year in 2015. The famed S&P 500 index is up a meager 2.3% since the New Year, and the Dow Jones Industrials index has lost 0.4%.
But there are always exceptions to the rule. We asked a panel of Motley Fool contributors to outline the five biggest surprises they've seen in 2015, and this is what they came up with.
Here, you'll find a few long-running turnaround stories such as video-game designer Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and casino operator Isle of Capri Casinos (NASDAQ:ISLE). Digital entertainment veteran Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), meanwhile, is going from strength to strength, and former bargain-bin shoe designer Skechers USA (NYSE:SKX) has become a powerhouse footwear brand in its own right. And what the heck is Natural Health Trends (NASDAQ:NHTC), other than a market-crushing titan in 2015? You'll soon find out.
These stocks have gained between 54% and 152% so far this year -- and that includes retreats from much loftier yearly highs in some cases. Dig into these juicy stock stories right here:
Image source: Netflix.
Brian Stoffel (Netflix): Let's consider where Netflix stood when it entered 2015. Although the company's stock had fallen 25% in the last three months of 2014, it still traded for a hefty valuation.
Shares were valued at 90 times trailing earnings, and Netflix hadn't produced positive free cash flow during the year. The company had just announced ambitious plans to expand to nearly every country on the map, and warned that it would take a while before its investments truly paid off.
Since then, the stock has more than doubled -- up an amazing 125% in just seven months' time. While it's still a mighty expensive holding -- now over 300 times trailing earnings -- the company's success at growing its subscriber base truly stands out.
Total global streaming subscriptions rose a whopping 30% to 65.5 million from the second quarter of 2014 to the same time frame this year. The biggest gains came outside the U.S. One year ago, there were 13.8 million international subscribers to Netflix services. That number has jumped almost 70% since then to 23.25 million. That kind of growth shows just how popular Netflix is with an international audience, and why the stock has done so well over such a short time frame.

Rich Duprey (Isle of Capri Casinos): For a casino operator that once seemed to be on its deathbed as the island gambling oasis of Macau off mainland China attracted betting and investment dollars, Isle of Capri Casinos has to be one of the most surprising turnaround stories -- not only of this year, but of the past few years.
The casino operator's recovery began last year, but has accelerated in earnest in 2015, with shares more than doubling since the start of the year.
Isle of Capri Casinos owns or operates 15 casinos in seven states, and strong performance has fueled its drive higher, with revenue and earnings topping analyst expectations. A continuously improving economy and more disposable cash in consumers' pockets have been big factors in helping the casino operator outpace even its thriving industry.
Unlike other bigger, more well-known players, Isle of Capri Casinos doesn't have exposure to Macau. Thus, when revenue there started to plummet last year after a crackdown on corruption, the U.S.-based operator, whose properties are mostly in secondary markets, was unfazed. This has helped its stock perform far better than its gaming peers.
There also doesn't appear to be any danger of the casino rolling snake eyes anytime soon, which makes Isle of Capri Casinos my most surprising stock of 2015.

Anders Bylund (Natural Health Trends): Did you know that Natural Health Trends shares have soared 150% higher so far in 2015? That the stock is up a massive 250% over the last year?
More to the point -- did you know that Natural Health Trends existed before clicking on this article?
Natural Health Trends is a multi-level marketing firm, relying on a network of customers-slash-contractors to sell the company's products. You could think of the company as the Tupperware of beauty products and nutritional supplements. If you've run across brands such as Valura, Skindulgence, Premium Noni Juice, or ReStor Vital, you've seen Natural Health Trends in action. You just didn't necessarily know it at the time.
So why is this no-name business storming up the charts in 2015?
Well, Natural Health Trends is enjoying a golden age in international markets. Specifically, sales in Hong Kong accounted for 92% of the company's revenue in the recently reported first quarter, on the back of an 80% year-over-year sales increase. Hong Kong is the company's gateway into China -- a local shipping center for customers and marketing partners in the Chinese mainland.
With China playing such a crucial role in Natural Health Trends' business results via that Hong Kong link, the company itself is pretty much a proxy for that particular Far Eastern market. Overall, first-quarter sales increased 76%, and net income more than doubled.
That being said, Natural Health Trends remains a micro-cap stock with a market cap of just over $300 million. In spite of the massive gains in the stock's rearview mirror, the share price has actually fallen about 45% from its 52-week high, with half of that decline coming in the past week and a half.
The Chinese consumer market isn't looking terribly healthy at the moment, and in America, networks of so-called independent contractors may soon be reclassified as taxable and benefits-laden employees.
Natural Health Trends is a risky stock with absolutely zero analyst coverage. I mean, the company issued a celebratory press release when it was selected for inclusion in the Russell 3000 and Russell Microcap indices, which is a far cry from joining the Dow or the S&P 500.
Long story short: If you're looking for stability and future promise, Natural Health Trends may not be for you. But the stock is hard to beat when it comes to momentum-driven rocket tickers at the moment.
That counts as a major surprise in my book.

Dan Caplinger (Electronic Arts): It wasn't so long ago that many had declared the era of traditional video games dead, with the potential competition from mobile devices and other newer options threatening the viability of console-based video gaming. Yet Electronic Arts has defied calls for its early demise, with the stock vaulting higher by 57% so far in 2015 after roughly doubling in 2014.
Electronic Arts' renaissance came largely thanks to new hardware from the major game-console makers, which gave EA a chance to showcase its game-making capabilities. With core franchises including Battlefield, Dragon Age, and sports must-haves like the Madden series of football video games, Electronic Arts has attracted gamers of all ages.
At the same time, EA has addressed some of the quality concerns that its customers had, with new games like Titanfall getting critical acclaim. EA's subscription service has also had early success. It offers gamers a chance to try older titles that they otherwise wouldn't buy, but at a price they're willing to pay, generating recurring revenue for the company.
Given how far it climbed in 2014, EA didn't have many investors thinking 2015 would be equally impressive. For now, though, Electronic Arts is executing flawlessly, and that bodes well for its future prospects.

Tamara Walsh (Skechers): In the past, when you wanted to buy a pair of knock-off sneakers, Skechers was your one-stop shop. Today, however, the retailer has evolved from a cheap purveyor of off-brand footwear into the number two brand share position in the U.S. athletic footwear market. As if that isn't surprising enough, the stock has gained an eye-popping 124% so far in 2015. Shares are now trading at an all-time high around $124 per share.
Skechers shocked Wall Street earlier this year after delivering blowout first-quarter results in which sales climbed a record 40% to $768 million. Earnings for the period also topped expectations, coming in at $1.10 per share. The strong fiscal 2015 first-quarter results came on the heels of an annual sales record of $2.4 billion in 2014.
It seems Skechers has a winning formula. The company isn't shy about using celebrity endorsements to move its products, including deals with world famous drummer Ringo Starr, recording artist Demi Lovato, and legendary quarterbacks Joe Montana and Joe Namath, to name a few. With the stock now trading near an all-time high, investors may want to remain on the sidelines for now. Nonetheless, it will be interesting to see if Skechers continues to surprise us in the quarters ahead.

            ","The leisure products industry includes companies across multiple sectors, including toys, video games, sports equipment, and recreational vehicles. These stocks often rise when the economy is healthy, unemployment is low, and disposable income is high. They fall out of favor when the opposite happens, since they aren't considered as essential as food and clothing.

Let's take a look at two top stocks investors should watch in this industry -- toymaker Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) and video game publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).
HasbroShares of Hasbro have risen 56% over the past 12 months, while shares of rival Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) have plunged 34%. Last quarter, Hasbro's sales rose 5% annually on a constant currency basis, while Mattel's slipped 1%. Hasbro's net income improved 25%, but Mattel posted a net loss.
The reason for that disparity is simple -- Hasbro licenses hot franchises based on blockbuster films, while a large portion of Mattel's revenue comes from Barbie, an aging franchise which has lost its appeal with young girls. Last quarter, Hasbro posted 1% annual sales growth at its boys category, which accounted for 43% of its top line, thanks to strong demand for Jurassic World, Marvel, and Star Wars toys. The Jurassic World effect also lifted sales of its preschool products by 14% to claim 15% of Hasbro's total sales.

The main sore spot for Hasbro was its girls' business, which accounted for 16% of its revenue. Sales slipped 22% annually due to lower demand for My Little Pony, Furby, and Nerf Rebelle products. 
Meanwhile, Mattel is more exposed than Hasbro to girls' brands. Last quarter, sales of Barbie and its ""other girls"" brands respectively declined 11% and 6% annually on a constant currency basis. Together, those two categories accounted for over half of its top line. Mattel's sole bright spot had been its exclusive right to manufacture Disney's (NYSE:DIS) popular Frozen dolls. Unfortunately, Hasbro was also granted the right to sell Disney princess dolls, including the Frozen characters, starting in 2016. 
Therefore, if you're looking for a toymaker which can profit from upcoming Marvel, Star Wars, and Disney films, Hasbro fits the bill perfectly.
Electronic ArtsMoving on from toys, let's check in on Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), one of the largest game publishers in the world. Last quarter, EA's revenue rose 5.5% annually as net income improved 7.6%. By comparison, rival Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) revenue rose 15% annually as net income climbed 34.5% last quarter. Activision looks like a better growth play, but EA is a more stable investment for three key reasons -- digital strength, diversification, and mobile growth.
52% of EA's revenue came from higher-margin digital platforms last quarter, versus 44% a year earlier. By comparison, 45% of Activision's revenue came from digital sales last quarter. EA's gaming portfolio is well-diversified across multiple genres, including sports games, shooters like Battlefield Hardline, RPGs like Dragon Age: Inquisition, licensed Star Wars games, and mobile titles. By comparison, Activision still relies heavily on three aging franchises -- World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Skylanders.

Looking ahead, EA's most eagerly anticipated game is Star Wars: Battlefront, an online role playing game which will launch in November to coincide with the Disney's release of Star Wars: Episode VII in December. If Battlefront is a hit, it could lure users away from other online RPGs like World of Warcraft.
On mobile devices, EA's revenue rose 18% annually to $136 million as monthly active users hit 165 million, thanks to the strong performance of games like Simpsons: Tapped Out. Activision's mobile revenues, which came from games like Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, only rose 4% annually to $86 million last quarter. This puts EA in a better position to capitalize on rising sales of mobile games, which could double from $17.5 billion in 2013 to $35.4 billion in 2017, according to research firms AppLift and Newzoo.
The verdictLeisure stocks like Hasbro and EA are ""sunny day stocks"" which will do well as long as consumer confidence remains high. However, that exuberance is also pushing both stocks to premium valuations -- Hasbro and EA now respectively trade at 26 and 28 times trailing earnings, compared to the S&P 500's P/E of 21. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on both stocks, but they should also realize that neither one is fundamentally cheap.

            ","Interest in 2015's E3 conference was massive. Streaming service Twitch said that the show attracted 21 million viewers to its site last month, up from 12 million in 2014. And the conference set records on social media as well, with 6 million Twitter posts and 8 million Instagram likes according to the Entertainment Software Association.
Taking E3's popularity as a proxy for video game demand gives us one more reason to believe publishers are in for a huge 2015. Here are a couple more: The release lineup is stacked, next-gen console installed bases are huge, and digital sales are boosting profit margins to the stratosphere. It's no wonder Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) stocks are both sitting at all-time highs. But which one is the better bet for investors right now?
Electronic Arts EA has momentum on its side. Its profitability leapt past 71% of sales this year, up from 63% in 2012. Operating cash flow has more than quadrupled since 2012 to $1 billion a year. 
But management thinks that's just the start. ""The digital transformation sweeping the whole industry is still in its infancy,"" Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen recently told investors. This tectonic shift provides a chance to ""grow margins by increasing the proportion of full game downloads, by providing extra content for games, and by taking our IP to mobile platforms,"" he predicted.

EA's upcoming release calendar is strong, and it starts with new entries in the blockbuster Madden, NHL, and FIFA franchises. But most of the excitement -- for gamers and investors -- centers around the Star Wars: Battlefront game set for release in November. This shooter attracted huge interest at E3, where executives stressed the game's fidelity to the epic Star Wars franchise. ""You can fly X-wings, TIE fighters, and the Millennium Falcon,"" producer Sigurlina Ingvarsdottir told the crowd. Battlefront could sell as many as 14 million copies, launching a bona fide new AAA franchise for EA in the process. 
Activision BlizzardIn contrast, Activision Blizzard is coming off a year in which two of its biggest brands, World of Warcraft and Call of Duty, registered sales declines. Yet the publisher made huge strides in diversifying its portfolio. With help from the likes of Hearthstone and Destiny, it now counts 10 leading franchises in its quiver, up from 5 last year.
And it's not as if Activision's business is struggling. Call of Duty's Advanced Warfare was yet again the top-selling video game of the year as Skylanders kicked in massive software and toy profits. The company booked record earnings last year as digital revenue pushed past 50% of sales.
The next year is all about expanding into new genres, business model, and markets for this publisher. Call of Duty Online is ramping up in China, while Guitar Hero will join Hearthstone to attack the massive market for casual gameplay on smartphones and tablets.

The most anticipated game in the lineup is of course Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. That title adds several innovations aimed at keeping the franchise fresh and on top of the sales charts as it enters its twelfth year. There's the zombie mode, for example, that promises to boost engagement and digital sales. 
ValuationThe two stock valuations have switched places lately, with EA's jumping to over 5 times sales from a low of 1 times sales just three years ago. In contrast, investors can snap up Activision for 4 times trailing revenue, a slight discount to last year's price.

Wall Street seems to be betting on a home run for EA with Star Wars. And the title's strong reception at E3, along with hefty preorder sales, suggests that's likely. But investors who prefer to own a more diversified software lineup at a cheaper price should consider Activision Blizzard.

It will be another four months before Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) releases its ""Star Wars: Battlefront"" game. But video game fans are already committing to the title in droves. The deluxe edition ranks No. 15 on Amazon's best-selling games list, ahead of currently available hits such as Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) ""Advanced Warfare"" or Ubisoft's ""Watch Dogs. Battlefront"" retails for a steep $70, which also happens to be the price of EA's shares at the moment.
But investors might want to buy the stock instead of the game if they have to pick only one. That purchase could earn them a tidy 14% profit.
The upgrade Despite a 100% rise over the last year, EA just won a new fan on Wall Street. UBS analyst Eric Sheridan upgraded the stock to ""buy"" this week while boosting his price target from $65 to $80. Sheridan's optimism centers around the ""Battlefront"" game, which he thinks will sell as many as 14 million copies, or 40% above management's forecast. 
After all, the title just cleaned up at this year's E3 conference, collecting hefty awards, including ""Best Action Game"" and ""Best Online Multiplayer."" Preorder sales through Amazon seem strong, and they'll likely receive heavy promotion by retailer GameStop this summer and fall.
And if ""Battlefront"" does meet strong gamer demand, investors can expect substantial profit growth to follow. That's mostly thanks to the positive role that digital sales are playing in EA's business right now. The channel has spiked to $2.2 billion annually, up from $1.7 billion just two years ago. The biggest piece of that growth is from consoles, where EA can market add-on content and full game downloads.
Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen recently explained to investors how that revenue supercharges EA's results:
The [add-on content] part of our business is growing dramatically. It not only extends the life of the game, but it also allows us to gain additional revenue on that life over time. And we find that what that also does is allows us to lower the cost of marketing to the next customer, because you're not paying a lot to reacquire someone; the customer is already playing.
Digital sales are the driving factor behind EA's huge profitability improvement. Gross profit is up to almost 70% of sales, pushing it past rival Activision Blizzard.

The payoff Those improving economics are why Sheridan thinks EA can book $3.01 per share in profit this year. That estimate is significantly higher than Wall Street's collective judgment: The 21 analysts who cover the stock see earnings coming in at $2.85 per share. EA's management, meanwhile, is targeting just $2.75 per share for the year. 

Source: Electronic Arts.
Still, UBS's stock price target seems reasonable. If the stock rose to $80 per share, it would be valued at 27 times that $3 profit figure. The current P/E valuation is 26 times, so we're not talking about a huge move. 
It's never a good idea to bet on one title changing the fortunes of a video game publisher. After all, Take-Two recently managed the single biggest sales result ever for an entertainment property launch with ""GTA V,"" yet the stock underperformed both EA and Activision. 
Also, it's possible that ""Battlefront"" will stumble out of the gate, especially given all the build-up. A lot depends on how the game works once it gets into players' hands. EA had to eat crow for some recent glitchy releases, including ""severely fumbling"" the launch of ""SimCity"" in 2013. That kind of slip-up could always happen again.
Still, I think the upcoming ""Battlefield"" launch is a great extra reason to like EA's business in addition to, say, the 9 percentage point gross profit margin improvement since 2012. For my money, though, I still like Activision Blizzard as the better video game stock value at the moment.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) made a number of notable announcements at E3 this year. The video game giant unveiled several new titles and showed off many of its upcoming releases. Below are three key takeaways from its press conference.
New games are comingAs a video game publisher, Electronic Arts' financial results depend entirely on its ability to release compelling new titles. The company spent most of E3 detailing its upcoming pipeline, the majority of which are slated to debut this year or in 2016.
Unsurprisingly, its sports franchises (FIFA, Madden, NBA Live, and NHL) will receive their regular annual installments this year with updated graphics and improved features. The company also plans to release an expansion pack to its massive multiplayer online game, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and a new entry in its racing series, Need for Speed. 
For 2016, Electronic Arts is scheduled to release a sequel to Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare, an online, team-based third-person shooter with a cartoon aesthetic. It will also release the fourth entry in its long-running sci-fi RPG series Mass Effect, along with a sequel to the 2008 action game Mirror's Edge. The company also plans to publish puzzle platformer, Unravel, what appears to be low-budget title, one unlikely to have much of an effect on earnings. However, it is a noticeable departure from Electronic Arts' traditional offerings.

Star Wars: Battlefront looks impressiveThe most important game in this lineup might be Star Wars: Battlefront. The Star Wars-themed first-person shooter is due to launch on Nov. 17th, just weeks before the release of the next feature film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Of all the upcoming titles, this seems most likely to provide a significant boost to the bottom line.
Electronic Arts announced the game several months ago but used E3 to show actual gameplay footage for the first time. Reviews for the game will not show up until just before its launch, but if the E3 presentation was any indication, the game looks spectacular.

Electronic Arts has said its current guidance is based on sales projections of nine million to 10 million copies. That estimate is based on previous Battlefront games (the last of which was released a decade ago) and Electronic Arts' long-running Battlefield series of first-person shooters. Battlefront is being developed by the same studio that produced Battlefield, and the similarities should be obvious to anyone who has played those games. Given the growing mania surrounding the reemergence of Star Wars (the first teaser trailer for Episode 7 has been viewed more than 69 million times on YouTube) management guidance could prove conservative.
Wading into the collectible card game genreElectronic Arts derives the majority of its sales from traditional gaming platforms -- consoles and  PCs -- but mobile gaming is growing rapidly, and Electronic Arts is an active participant. Last quarter, mobile brought in about 13% of adjusted net revenue. In time, it could be much more: Research firm eMarketer expects the market for mobile games in the U.S. to rise 16.5% in 2015.
The company did not spend much time discussing its mobile initiatives but did announce one new title -- Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, a collectible card game.
Without too many specifics, it is difficult to judge just how big Galaxy of Heroes could be. But it seems remarkably similar to Hearthstone, a collectible card game rival Activison Blizzard launched on mobile devices last year. Hearthstone has been something of a surprise success for Activision. As of May, Hearthstone, along with newcomer Destiny, had generated a combined $1 billion in adjusted revenue.
Gamers might not take to Galaxy of Heroes with the same enthusiasm, but if they do, it could become an unexpected source of upside in the quarters to come.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) continues its impressive run.
Shares of the video game publisher rose on Tuesday, after the company turned in a fiscal fourth quarter earnings report that greatly exceeded expectations. Electronic Arts' business appears to be firing on all cylinders, as demand for its games continues to surge in the face of strong next-generation console adoption.
During its subsequent earnings call, Electronic Arts' management, including CEO Andrew Wilson and CFO Blake Jorgensen, offered a number of key insights into the company's business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that call.
On Electronic Arts' upcoming slate of gamesAs a major video game publisher, Electronic Arts' business is entirely beholden to the popularity of its games. A major title can generate the bulk of its performance in a key quarter, while a disappointment could lead to an earnings miss. Early in the call, Wilson offered investors a quick rundown of Electronic Arts' plans for new games in the coming fiscal year.
In addition to Star Wars: Battlefront ... the latest releases of Rory McIlroy: PGA Tour, Madden NFL, FIFA, NHL, and NBA Live ... FY 2016 will see the return of Need for Speed as we introduce a new console experience as well as a new mobile game. Maxis will continue to deliver great new content for The Sims 4, including another expansion pack, multiple game packs, and additional game updates for the growing Sims 4 player community ... we will be returning to the Plants vs. Zombies universe with a bigger and bolder new console experience ... Minions Paradise ... will be one of at least five new EA Mobile titles this year. In spring 2016, Mirror's Edge is set to revolutionize the action-adventure genre with its stunning first-person gameplay.
Margins are improvingAs a business, Electronic Arts' underlying performance is improving. Two years ago, Electronic Arts' management made a commitment to double adjusted operating margins to 20%, but managed to surpass that guidance a year ahead of schedule. During the call, Jorgensen noted and explained Electronic Arts' rapid improvement.
When we first started talking about improving the performance of Electronic Arts, I suggested it would take three years to double our non-GAAP operating margins from 10% to 20%. We've exceeded that in two years. In fact, at nearly 25%, our fiscal 2015 operating margin is over 500 basis points above our guidance at the beginning of the year and at its highest point in over a decade. We've dramatically increased our efficiency. Non-GAAP operating expenses are down a full 10 percentage points, from 56% of net revenue in FY 2013 to just 46% in FY 2015.
The digital shift continuesElectronic Arts has been a vocal proponent of the ongoing shift toward digital distribution. While physical game discs still compose the bulk of games Electronic Arts sells on major consoles, it may not be that way for much longer. During the call, COO Peter Moore noted the trends Electronic Arts is seeing in its business.
Our full-game downloads that you're seeing, they do vary from title and by geography. But the latest data we've got shows us at a 20%+ for Battlefield Hardline, and that's up from about 13% to 15% this time last year for our AAA title releases. So we're seeing the growth.
Expectations for Star WarsAlthough Electronic Arts has many games scheduled for its upcoming fiscal year, in terms of importance, one title in particular is likely to stand above the rest. Star Wars: Battlefront, its upcoming first-person shooter, is scheduled to debut in November, just a month before the release of the next Star Wars film. During the call, Jorgensen gave Electronic Arts' expectations for the games, likening it to past Battlefront games and Electronic Arts' other first-person shooters.
We're thinking about [Battlefront] with two bookends. One bookend is the historical Battlefront, which did roughly 9 million units. The other bookend is our core first-person shooter franchise of Battlefield, which typically does around 15 million units. So I think in our guidance, we've roughly put in there roughly 9 million to 10 million units for the title, with we believe some upside obviously if things goes well. It is [Xbox One and PlayStation 4]-only and PC, and so that needs to get factored into people's thinking, but it is a very exciting title.
A possible delay?Electronic Arts has delayed several of its key games in recent months, including most recently, Battlefield: Hardline. The delays don't seem to have had much of an effect on Electronic Arts' performance, as the extra development time may have ensured a better product. But that likely won't be true for Star Wars: Battlefront. A key element to the game's success could be its timing in relation to the debut of Star Wars in theaters. If Battlefront is delayed -- perhaps pushed out to January or February of 2016 -- some of the buzz could die down, and sales could disappoint. During the call, Wilson touched on this topic, noting that anything is possible, but the company is currently very committed to launching Battlefront in November.
With that said, there are any number of things that might contribute to a miss or a need to move a date. As it relates to Star Wars: Battlefront, I would say as it stands right now, we feel very, very good about the trajectory and the velocity of the development team.

            ","Back in 2012, it was estimated that the U.S. video game industry grew four times faster than the U.S. economy from 2009 through 2012 by the Entertainment Software Association. Looking ahead, research firm DFC Intelligence estimates that worldwide game sales will soar from $63 billion in 2014 to $100 billion by 2018.

However, the video game industry can be tough for new investors to understand. Many gaming companies are overly dependent on blockbuster franchises. Accelerated release schedules cause studios to launch games before they're ready, resulting in franchise-killing flops. In-app purchases and downloadable content can turn some games into ""pay-to-win"" affairs. 
Therefore, let's take a look at two types of video game companies -- reliable core holdings and volatile mobile plays -- to see which types of gaming companies suit your investing style.
Core stocks: EA and Activision BlizzardGame publishing giants Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) are solid core holdings for any video game centered portfolio.
Electronic Arts had a rough run over the past few years. The Consumerist named EA the worst company in America in 2012 and 2013, following botched, bug-ridden launches of flagship games like SimCity and Battlefield 4. 

Battlefield 4 represented a low point in EA's history. Source: EA.
Under new CEO Andrew Wilson, who replaced John Riccitiello in 2013, EA delayed titles rather than rush them into a holiday release (such as Battlefield Hardline) and streamlined its mobile business. As a result, EA's non-GAAP revenue improved 6% annually in 2014 as net income more than doubled. Mobile revenue hit $460 million in 2014, up from $104 million in 2013, thanks to the success of its mobile sports games and tie-in games with console titles.
Activision Blizzard's top line is highly dependent on aging franchises like Call of Duty, Skylanders, and World of Warcraft. As a result, Activision's stock price is often weighed down by weakening Call of Duty sales or slumping World of Warcraft subscriber numbers. However, Activision has steadily diversified its top line with new IPs like Destiny. In 2014, Activision's non-GAAP revenues rose 11% as earnings rose higher than 50%. However, revenue at Activision's mobile unit, which accounted for 12% of its top line, fell 29% year-over-year as its mobile games failed to impress.
On a fundamental basis, Activision stock is cheaper at 20 times earnings, compared to EA's P/E of 22. However, EA stock also rallied 103% over the past 12 months, compared to Activision's 16% gain.
Speculative stocks: Zynga, King, and Glu MobileMobile gaming stocks are more speculative investments than heavyweight publishers like EA and Activision. Let's take a look at three such stocks: Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), King Digital Entertainment (NYSE:KING), and Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:GLUU).
Zynga's two top games are Farmville 2 and Zynga Poker, which together generated 43% of its revenue last quarter. 40% of Glu's revenue came from its chart-topping hit, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood last quarter. King's top franchise is Candy Crush Saga, which accounted for 45% of the company's ""gross bookings"" last quarter. 
Both Zynga and King often refer to gross bookings, or total purchases of virtual products (like energy packs), instead of revenue. Those purchases are initially reported as deferred revenue and recognized as bookings over the estimated time that it takes to ""consume"" the virtual product.

King's Candy Crush Saga could give your portfolio cavities.
There are a few notable problems with this business model. First, any slowdown in top grossing games will cause their stocks to slide. The companies must then develop and market new games to offset those losses, but doing so can cause operating expenses to spike. 
Most mobile game makers generate revenue from a ""freemium"" model. However, 60% of those revenues across the industry come from just 0.23% of all players, according to mobile marketing firm Swrve. This means that all three companies rely heavily on so-called ""whales"" to keep buying virtual goods as the majority of gamers play for free. As we can see from Zynga, King, and Glu's top and bottom line numbers for 2014, that top-heavy business model yields mixed results.

            ","This article was originally published April 20, 2015 and updated September 28, 2016.
Want to know what the best stocks are in the video gaming industry? You’re not alone. The gaming industry has delivered fantastic returns in recent years, and make no mistake, the trend toward widespread video game usage means the outlook for game stocks is still strong. Given this self-evident trend, you might be looking for game stocks to include in your portfolio. It's not easy but thorough analysis will always yield the best stocks to buy today as long as one has a long term perspective.

The video game industry has plenty of great stocks to offer. Image Source: Getty Images.
Investors looking to get exposure to this industry have a variety of options, but Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) are three of the best companies in the space.
Electronic Arts was one of the single best performing tech stocks in 2014. Shares of the publisher more than doubled, as sales of several of its key titles, including Titanfall and Dragon Age: Inquisition, exceeded expectations. That surge has given Electronic Arts a more aggressive valuation than some of its rivals, but the stock could continue to deliver in the quarters to come. 
Among video game publishers, Electronic Arts has what may be the most interesting game for 2015. In November the company will launch Star Wars: Battlefront, a multiplayer first person shooter set in the fictional Star Wars universe. On its own, the game already had the potential to be a top-selling title, but it could be catapulted up the rankings by the fervor surrounding the upcoming film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which will arrive in theaters roughly one month after Battlefront hits store shelves. Electronic Arts released a trailer for the game on Friday, and it looks -- to put it mildly -- stunning.

In addition, Electronic Arts also has its sports franchises (including Madden and FIFA), which continue to be consistent winners. Electronic Arts depends mostly on traditional consoles, but versions of its sports games designed for smartphones and tablets have helped propel its mobile revenue, which rose 26% year-over-year last quarter.
Activision Blizzard has fewer franchises than Electronic Arts, but the titles it does release are almost always massively successful. Activision has several billion-dollar franchises and household names under its belt, including World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Skylanders.
The latter two will receive new entries later this year, along with a new title in the Guitar Hero series. Destiny -- which is developed by Bungie but published by Activision -- will be supported with a series of digital expansions. Destiny was something of a drain on Activison shares last fall after reviewers panned the title, but it ultimately went on to become the best-selling game in a new series ever.
Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, has been expanding to new platforms in recent months. Last week, it arrived on Android and the iPhone for the first time. Hearthstone is a free-to-play mobile game, but it is aimed more at gaming enthusiasts than casual players. Since its release last year, Activision has continued to support the game with a series of expansions, and its revenue has grown from month to month. When Activision last reported earnings, it noted that Hearthstone set a record for monthly revenue in December.
Longer-term, Activision has two new titles planned, Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm, and could reap long-term financial rewards from Call of Duty: Online, a free-to-play version of its massively popular shooter currently exclusive to China.
Take-Two is a much smaller company than both Electronic Arts and Activision, but it has one of the largest franchises in gaming: Grand Theft Auto. The latest installment, Grand Theft Auto V, originally released in 2013, has become one of the best selling games in history, moving more than 45 million units as of the end of last quarter.
Unlike its competitors, Take-Two has been reluctant to turn Grand Theft Auto into an annual series, instead releasing a new entry every four to five years. But in the meantime, Take-Two has been able to monetize Grand Theft Auto through Grand Theft Auto Online, a separate, online version of the game that includes the ability to purchase in-game currency with real money.
Of course, Take-Two is more than just Grand Theft Auto. It has two sports series -- NBA2K and WWE -- that should receive entries this year. In addition, Red Dead Redemption, a game Take-Two released in 2010 to both great critical and commercial success, could be about to get a sequel. It is not confirmed, but the company has been hinting at its development.

            ","When it comes to your Roth IRA, a good strategy is to aim for holdings that will grow briskly. That's because the money earned in a Roth IRA can be withdrawn tax-free. Thus, it's smart to park at least some stocks in your Roth IRA that have the potential to be big long-term winners.
Here are three compelling candidates:
Image: Electronic Arts.
Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA)Electronic Arts is a powerhouse in the booming and profitable world of video games. It struggled in recent years, but CEO Andrew Wilson has been turning things around in a big way, with the stock more than doubling over the past year. And with its recent and forward-looking P/E ratios only in the low 20s, it's still not grossly overvalued.
Electronic Arts is generating about a billion dollars annually in free cash flow. Gross margins have been rising over the past few years, and net margins recently approached a hefty 20%. Part of the reason for the margin growth is a big push into subscription-based gaming, via its EA Access program, giving subscribers access to older titles. The industrywide move toward digital downloads of games is also boosting profits, as games no longer have to be printed, packaged, and stocked on shelves.
Other catalysts for the business include the relatively new Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles, which will boost demand for new games, and the company's push into mobile gaming, which is projected to generate $21 billion industrywide this year, with digital gamers spending a third of their dollars on mobile games. Mobile games are expected by some to hit $60 billion by 2017. Another promising catalyst is the upcoming Star Wars: Battlefront game, which will make its debut late in the year, along with the latest Star Wars movie.
Meanwhile, the company still has its strong franchises of Madden NFL, Battlefield, and FIFA -- and mobile successes with SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile, and FIFA Ultimate Team. For its third quarter, the company posted revenue up 39% year over year, and more than 160 million monthly active users for its mobile games. The company certainly seems to have more room to run.
Image: Priceline Group.
Priceline Group Inc. (NASDAQ:PCLN)Priceline Group Inc was once known for its name-your-own-price airfare deals, but it's grown into an online travel juggernaut, having gobbled up Booking.com, Kayak.com, and OpenTable, among other successful businesses. It now offers discounted booking for airfares, hotels, car rentals, and vacation packages -- and now bookings for restaurants, too. Another recent acquisition is Rocketmiles, which will give Priceline an appealing loyalty program, via the ability to offer airline miles as rewards with bookings, boosting its appeal and competitiveness.
Past performance doesn't guarantee future success, but based on past performance, Priceline seems poised to continue growing significantly in a Roth IRA. Over the past decade, its revenue and earnings, respectively, have averaged annual gains of 25% and 54%. Its gross margins have soared from about 28% to 90% over that span, while net margins have popped from 20% to nearly 29%. In its fourth quarter, gross bookings rose 17% year over year, with earnings per share rising 20%. International bookings grew by 27%, which bodes well for the company's prospects, as much of its growth potential lies abroad. It's also an impressive number considering recent weakness in Europe and China.
Priceline stock seems appealingly priced, too. It has averaged annual growth of 46.5% over the past decade, but is down a smidge over the past year. Its P/E ratio was recently only 26 for such a fast grower, and its forward-looking P/E just 16, well below its five-year average of 30. Management has deemed its stock price attractive enough to get a $3 billion stock buyback program approved, with which to reward shareholders. Priceline might be even more profitable today if it weren't plowing a lot of money into advertising and into its businesses such as OpenTable and BookingsSuite. But such investments today can pay off powerfully tomorrow.
Facebook stock has been on a bit of a tear since it debuted.
Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB)We all know that Facebook is a big growth story. Its revenue and earnings per share, respectively, have averaged annual gains of 50% and 37% over the past three years, while its stock has soared. Yet with a forward-looking P/E ratio near 33, the stock doesn't seem too pricey at recent levels.
To understand the company's great growth potential, you just have to review a few numbers. As of the end of 2014, it had 890 million active daily users -- nearly a billion people -- a level up 18% over the year before. Its mobile active daily users numbered nearly as much, 745 million, up 34% from the year before. Even more intriguing, more than 80% of its active daily users are outside the U.S. and Canada.
Once you appreciate its great reach, think about what Facebook knows about most of us users, and what it can do with that information. It's already making a lot of money from ads on its site -- remember, its service remains free for its billion-some users -- and it's moving into video ads. It can use its data gathered on users to target ads so that they're more likely to be effective. Facebook's advertising revenue soared 65% in 2014, to $11.5 billion, its number of active monthly advertisers hit a whopping 2 million, and it grabbed market share from titan Google. It's impressively effective in advertising, too, managing to significantly reduce its number of ads in 2014's fourth quarter while boosting their average price more than fourfold. Meanwhile, Facebook is even threatening eBay's PayPal unit, adding a payment feature to its Messenger App.
Facebook can also leverage its broad base in others ways, such as by trying to enter the professional networking arena. And with annual free cash flow topping $3.6 billion, it has the ability to buy plenty of promising technologies. It has bought Oculus VR, for example, which offers virtual-reality technology, and the popular WhatsApp app as well. Most recently, Facebook bought TheFind, a personalized e-commerce search service that can strengthen its ability to offer targeted advertising to its users. The company has been a savvy acquirer -- think of Instagram, bought for $1 billion a few years ago and recently worth $35 billion, with some 300 million monthly active users.
Whether you buy these or other companies for your Roth IRA, look for strong and healthy growers, as any exponential growth that occurs in your portfolio will be available to you tax-free in retirement.

            ","People are spending a lot of time playing video games these days. And I do mean a lot. 
Electronic Arts(NASDAQ:EA)saw gameplay hours for Madden NFL 15 jump 30% last quarter as compared to the prior year. And gamers spent an average of three hours per day playing Destiny in the first few months after launch, according to publisher Activision Blizzard(NASDAQ:ATVI).
Those banner engagement figures powered a massive profit spike at both gaming companies. EA managed an all-time high 68% profit margin last quarter, while Activision posted 51% higher earnings -- a record $1.42 per share. But whereas EA shares surged by over 100% in the past year, Activision stock has hardly budged.
So, does that make the owner of the Call of Duty and Skylanders franchises the obvious investment choice from here? Let's compare the two biggest publishers in the video game industry, starting with a few key statistics:
Revenue and sales growth are based on the last complete fiscal year. Profit margin is trailing 12 months. Source: Company filings
Broadly speaking, Activision looks like the cheaper investment. You can buy it at a discount to EA whether you are considering price-to-earnings or price-to-sales multiples. In fact, Activision has EA beat on all of the major metrics except one: profitability.
Electronic Arts is winning the digital warProfitability has been the main driver behind the amazing gains EA shares have enjoyed the past year. Gross profit margin is up from 58% of sales in 2011 to a projected 71% this year. The company even beat its larger rival on this key metric last quarter.

EA Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.
EA managed that feat through a few big wins, including its best yet Dragon Age game launch and solid improvements in the FIFA, Madden, and Sims franchises. But the biggest reason for the profit bounce has been its success with downloadable content sales. 
Digital revenue accounted for a record 49% of sales last quarter, up 35% from the prior year. And on a trailing 12 month basis, those highly profitable digital sales now represent more than half of EA revenue. The trend promises to keep lifting earnings higher in the next few years.
Source: Bungie
Activision Blizzard expands its portfolioActivision is also benefiting from that digital shift: The channel was responsible for 46% of sales in the past year, up 50% from 2013. That is particularly impressive when you consider how much revenue Activision gets from retail toy sales tied to its Skylanders kids franchise. 
But the best reason to like Activision Blizzard right now is its growing portfolio of AAA game brands. At the beginning of 2014, just three franchises, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Sklyanders, accounted for the vast majority of sales and profit. 
But with Destiny and Hearthstone added to the mix last year, and with Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, and Call of Duty Online slated for 2015, the portfolio will be packed with 10 blockbuster franchises by the end of this year.  
Foolish wrapWhile both businesses are performing well, I believe Activision Blizzard is the better investment. Yes, EA profitability should march higher, particularly as it rings the register on the recent Battlefield: Hardline release. However, those profit gains seem to be reflected in a stock that is now valued at 23 times trailing earnings, up from 17 times just three months ago.
The valuation gap alone suggests that Activision will outperform its smaller publishing rival over the next five years. Investors now have two great choices if they want diverse exposure to the surging video game market. But they can get that exposure at a comparative steal through Activision.

            ","It took George Lucas nearly thirty years to release six Star Wars films -- Disney could accomplish that feat in less than a decade.
Beginning this December with The Force Awakens, theater-goers are about to be inundated with a wave of Star Wars films -- not just mainline entries, but also side stories and spin-offs. Assuming they're as popular as the Star Wars movies that captivated audiences in years past, they should propel the shares of a wide variety of businesses beyond Disney (NYSE:DIS) itself.
Below are three less obvious stocks that could get a boost from Star Wars' return.
AMC should benefit from strong attendanceWith 348 locations and nearly 5,000 screens, AMC Holdings (NYSE:AMC) is one of the top movie theater chains in the United States. Its business is entirely dependent on the American public's interest in films -- and Star Wars should provide a nice jolt.
AMC has suffered from declining attendance figures in recent quarters -- an industrywide trend. To some extent, this may be to due to shifts in the broader competitive landscape: more appealing entertainment options and Internet streaming services have taken some of the allure out of theater attendance. But in its most recent earnings call, AMC blamed a weak film slate for its ticket sales, noting that it was the mercy of Hollywood to provide it with interesting films.
Star Wars should provide those films, drawing crowds of patrons to AMC's theaters in the years ahead. There are other publicly traded movie theater chains, but AMC may be the best bet, as its management has been able to persevere and even outperform the industry. Last quarter, AMC's admissions revenues per screen rose 13.8% -- much better than the 4.3% industrywide contraction.
Special effects best seen on an IMAX screenMany of those theater-goers could choose to see Star Wars on an IMAX (NYSE:IMAX) screen. If so, it should benefit that namesake company.
The high-end theater provider has been a frequent target of short-sellers in recent months: nearly one-fifth of its shares have been bet against. IMAX's business depends on the demand for its IMAX-branded screens, and with theater attendance in decline, the market for IMAX's systems could come under pressure.
IMAX has proven its critics wrong, rallying more than 20% over the last 12 months, but shares could rally further still as a wave of Star Wars films juices the demand for its systems. Star Wars films, perhaps more so than any other, depend on cutting-edge visuals and special effects, and watching them on an IMAX screen may offer a much better experience.
Electronic Arts' Star Wars-themed games should get more attentionVideo game giant Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) won't make any money from theater attendance -- at least not directly -- but consumers swept up in Star Wars mania could find themselves turning to Electronic Arts' upcoming slate of Star Wars-themed video games.
In 2013, Disney signed an exclusive pact with Electronic Arts to develop Star Wars games aimed at ""core audiences"" -- gamers that play on the Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. The first of these games, Star Wars: Battlefront, will debut later this year in conjunction with the release of The Force Awakens, and more should be forthcoming.
If the games are poorly made, they may not sell well, but the use of the Star Wars' intellectual property should at least attract the attention of gamers, many of whom are likely to be Star Wars fans.

            ","Gaming stocks have done very well over the past year. Third-party publishers have benefited from the introduction of new consoles from Sony and Microsoft as well as increasing digital sales, and these tailwinds helped every third-party console game publisher except for Ubisoft beat the market over the last 12 months. While Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive both posted solid gains, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) performed best of all, nearly doubling over the period.
The company's incredible stock gains have pushed its forward P/E ratio to roughly 28. Using this metric, EA stands as the priciest of the third-party games publishers. Yet, with a strong position in a growing industry and apparent improvement in the company's operations, Electronic Arts is also the most expensive stock worth buying in the realm of gaming companies.
Surveying the fieldElectronic Arts develops and publishes hit franchises like FIFA, Madden NFL, and Battlefield, and has ridden strong software performance to gains of roughly 93% over the last year. The company has also posted the best growth of any gaming company in the last five years, delivering gains of roughly 217% while the S&P 500 increased roughly 82%. Across the same stretch, Activision, Take Two, and Ubisoft made gains of 109%, 136%, and 46%, respectively. Surveying the competition: Activision Blizzard looks solid even as the Call of Duty series is losing some of its pull, Take Two seems to be building a stronger lineup on top of the megahit Grand Theft Auto series, while Ubisoft is looking a bit weak due to declining performance from its Assassin's Creed property.
EA is winning the digital distribution gameAlso key to Electronic Arts' growth is the advancement of its mobile presence and booming digital software sales. Selling games digitally rather than through retailers like GameStop is enabling the company to improve its margins and drive revenues through direct-to-consumer promotions. This has helped the company deliver results for its last four quarters that were significantly better than the average analyst estimate, and each earnings release prompted a significant stock bump. For the company's fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014, roughly 45% of the company's revenue came from digital sales. This impressive figure was partially propelled by a 47% year-over-year increase in the sale of downloadable content for games.
EA looks to have room to further improve its margins as digital distribution continues to make gains at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailers. The company's EA Access program functions as a year-long subscription to previously released games from some of its big series at a relatively low price of $30, and the company has indicated that the package has been quite successful. These types of direct-to-consumer promotions help the publisher to absorb revenue that might have otherwise been generated from used copies of its games.
Big franchises, mobile growth, and beyondElectronic Arts seems primed for more strong performance in the year to come, with new installments in some of the company's biggest franchises set to release, as well as the revival of the Star Wars: Battlefont series. The company should continue to benefit from the expanding user base for the new gaming consoles, as well as the ongoing growth in digital sales. It also has a major growth opportunity in mobile.
Research firm Digi-Capital estimates that mobile gaming will grow at a 23% compound aggregate growth rate, and hit $60 billion in sales by 2017, with the total gaming industry being worth $100 billion. Electronic Arts has a solid stable of franchises that it can use to ride this wave, a crucial asset because recognizable brands are often necessary to stand out in the crowded mobile software landscape. The company recently scored mobile hits with SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile, and FIFA Ultimate Team, and it looks like these properties are primed for continued gains.
With strong footing in console and mobile gaming, and great momentum in digital content distribution, EA is well-diversified across its industry. There has even been talk that the games publisher will team with Comcast to stream games through the cable-provider's X1 cable box. Even though Electronic Arts is priced for growth, there's plenty of evidence it can deliver. EA stands as the most expensive stock making games worth buying.

            ","Apple stock has been on an incredible run over the last year. Shares have increased roughly 67% in a 12-month span, with total returns coming in at a fantastic 70%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has gained roughly 12% over the period.
Apple stock currently trades near all-time highs, and the company has set a new record for highest market cap in history. But as great as the iPhone maker's performance has been, it isn't the only stock that's been crushing the market. We asked three Fool contributors to spotlight a company that has delivered even greater returns than Apple within the last year. Read on to learn about these massive market beaters.
Dan Caplinger (Skyworks Solutions): Apple has been a huge performer over the past year, but the company has grown so large that it's hard for even its massive results quarter after quarter to move the needle as much as smaller companies can experience. One great example of that phenomenon comes from Apple supplier Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), which has ridden the coattails of various tech giants to its own great success.
It's true that Skyworks owes some of its success to Apple. But the nearly 150% returns that the stock has posted in the past year aren't due entirely to the Cupertino-based tech giant. Indeed, one of the areas that Skyworks believes could help it grow the fastest involves the rising popularity of wireless communication generally. For high-end operations, Skyworks hopes to help support high-bandwidth uses like streaming video and music through its customized signal-filtering and tuning solutions. Meanwhile, other uses like navigation and power-management offer different but equally promising chances for Skyworks to broaden its business reach. With the rise of the Internet of Things, mobile payments, and on-demand entertainment, Skyworks doesn't have to labor entirely in Apple's shadow, and with plenty of runway left ahead, Skyworks could easily keep outpacing Apple's returns in 2015 and beyond.
Joe Tenebruso (Electronic Arts): Few large-cap companies have outperformed Apple over the last year. Yet surprisingly, what was once deemed ""The Worst Company in America"" has done just that.
After struggling for years with stagnating game franchises and a poor reputation among gamers, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) appears to have righted the ship. The long-beleaguered video game maker turned in an impressive 2014 and has risen more than 90% in the last 12 months, compared to Apple's nearly 70% returns.
Fueled by the launch of new game consoles like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, EA's trailing-12-month revenue surged 22% over the prior-year period. And thanks in part to a major shift toward higher-margin digital revenue -- which now comprises more than half of EA's total revenue-- adjusted earnings rose an even more impressive 51% during that time.
New CEO Andrew Wilson is taking steps to restore Electronics Arts' image among gamers by delivering high-quality new games such as the critically acclaimed Dragon Age: Inquisition, as well as popular new services such as EA Access, where gamers can subscribe to digital access to EA's older titles. These initiatives, along with consistently strong operational performance throughout 2014, have even led my Foolish colleague Sam Mattera to name Wilson the best tech CEO of 2014.
Keith Noonan (Ambarella): Growing demand for wearables and security cameras has propelled chipmaker Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) to incredible gains over the last year. The company is a small-cap stock with a market cap of around $2 billion, and its stock is prone to big swings, but shares have gained roughly 85% over the last 12 months and it looks like the company is poised to continue delivering wins for investors. Ambarella supplies image and video processing chips for devices such as GoPro cameras, and recently delivered great results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year. Sales for the annual term were up 38.5% over the prior year, and earnings per diluted share grew nearly 85%.
With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 40, Ambarella is priced for sustained growth and well above Apple's forward P/E of roughly 15, but the semiconductor company appears to be in shape to deliver. It anticipates that annual revenue will increase between 27% and 30% this year, along with improved operating margins, and there are reasons to believe the chipmaker's growth story is just getting started. Business is picking up in China and South Korea, and Ambarella is diversifying its customer base with wins in Xiaomi's upcoming low-cost action camera and the emerging drone market.
Security and automotive cameras also look poised for growth, and Ambarella's expertise in low-power, high-performance video chips will enable it to benefit from the rise of the Internet of Things. The stock could be a great pick for investors who are looking to capitalize on momentum in cameras but find individual camera makers like GoPro too risky.

            ","2014 was a solid year for the markets: the S&P 500 finished with an 11% gain. But a few tech stocks turned in even better performances. In particular, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) trounced the market, soaring in 2014.
Is it time to take profits in these tech stock winners? Or should investors in these stocks consider holding? Below, three Motley Fool contributors offer their takes on some of last year's best performers.
Bob Ciura (Facebook): Facebook continued to be a huge winner for investors last year. The stock gained more than 40% in 2014, which handily beat the broader market yet again. This continued a longer-term trend of strong outperformance since Facebook's initial public offering. Facebook's share price has doubled since its May 2012 IPO, as its key metrics -- revenue, active users, and profits -- have all racked up strong growth. Indeed, last year Facebook grew revenue and earnings per share by 58% and 83%, respectively, as monthly active users reached 1.39 billion.
But at some point, investors need to consider Facebook's valuation. The stock trades for 70 times 2014 GAAP diluted earnings, which is a significant concern. So far, investors seem too willing to brush aside Facebook's valuation, but that can be dangerous thinking. When discussing valuation as it pertains to social media stocks, some argue that valuation doesn't really matter for growth stocks. Instead, these companies will grow fast enough to justify their lofty valuations. And many times, that's absolutely true. However, there comes a point Facebook can't keep growing at accelerating rates.
Facebook is now a $214 billion company by market capitalization. This is an enormous company. Investors buying in at these levels are at risk of poor future returns, if and when Facebook's tantalizing growth finally begins to slow down. Even great companies can be bad investments in cases of overvaluation. Investors may want to take some of their Facebook profits off the table.
Tamara Walsh (Apple): The tech giant was a high flyer last year, with its stock gaining nearly 79% compared to just a 14% gain by the S&P 500 over the same period. Apple has enjoyed such a momentous run, in fact, that it is now worth more than the entire S&P 600 small-cap index. And with a market cap north of $755 billion today, Apple is not only the most valuable company in history, but it is also worth more than double any other publicly traded company on the market today.
Nevertheless, with shares of Apple currently trading near record highs at around $130 apiece, many investors worry there could be a correction on the horizon. For starters, there's a lot of pressure building around the tech titan's upcoming Apple Watch launch, which is set to hit the market in April. The company is planning a media event on March 9 that many speculate is related to the anticipated debut of its first truly wearable device. Yet, if Apple's upcoming iWatch isn't a hit with consumers it could bolster concerns that Apple is losing its innovative edge -- a reality that would likely crush the stock in its wake.
However, the stock's stratospheric surge and future execution risks are hardy reason enough to sell this tech stock superstar. Even if Apple's iWatch is a flop, the company has enough liquid assets and cash on hand to offset any related losses. Not to mention, Apple will continue to reward current shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Apple, for example, spent more than $56 billion last year on dividends and share repurchases, and analysts at Credit Suisse believe Apple will raise its capital return plan to $202 billion by 2017, according to the Financial Times.
Therefore, even at all time highs, Apple is one tech stock winner that investors should own for many more years to come.
Sam Mattera (Electronic Arts): Video game publisher Electronic Arts was one of the single best performing stocks in the market last year. Boosted by the launch of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, Electronic Arts shares doubled in 2014, and have continued to rally in 2015.
Electronic Arts isn't the bargain it was a year ago, but it may not be time to take profits just yet. The console cycle that benefited Electronic Arts remains in its infancy -- the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 have been on the market only a fraction as long as their predecessors. As more gamers adopt these platforms, Electronic Arts will gain more potential customers for its upcoming titles. Electronic Arts faces a lot of competition, but may be the most innovative major publisher. Last July, it launched EA Access, a first of its kind subscription service that allows it to monetize older content.
Led by its new CEO, Andrew Wilson, Electronic Arts is slowly turning around its poor image, and releasing higher quality games. Later this month, it will launch Battlefield: Hardline, and in December, it will benefit from the return of Star Wars with Star Wars: Battlefront.

            ","Star Wars: The Force Awakens will open in theaters on Dec 18.
Sometime around then -- perhaps a week or two before -- Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) will launch Star Wars: Battlefront, a first-person shooter video game set in the Star Wars universe. Battlefront is being developed by Electronic Arts' DICE studio, known primarily for its work on the popular Battlefield franchise.
Battlefield has long stood as the chief rival to Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) Call of Duty series. Despite facing tough competition from Electronic Arts over the years, Activision's titles have continued to generate billions in sales.
Yet, Star Wars: Battlefront represents a unique challenge, one that should not be discounted by shareholders.
Riding a wave of Star Wars hypeElectronic Arts' management has said it plans to promote Star Wars: Battlefront aggressively, leveraging the power of the Star Wars cultural phenomenon to drive sales.
By the time Episode 7 debuts in theaters, it will have been more than a decade since the release of a Star Wars film. Anticipation should be high -- Disney paid $4 billion for a reason -- and it could be contagious, particularly among avid video game players.
Star Wars has served as inspiration for dozens of video games over the years, and many of them have proven to be quite popular. Star Wars: Battlefront is itself a reboot of a game originally released in 2004, one that sold roughly 3 million copies and earned a sequel.
If nothing else, the latest incarnation of Battlefront should benefit from a general interest in Star Wars sparked by the release of the film. It's also quite likely, however, that the game will be well-received: As a studio, DICE has a strong track record, with several critically acclaimed games under its belt, including Mirror's Edge and Battlefield 4.
Call of Duty may be facing franchise fatigueIt's entirely possible that gamers could purchase both, but Activision's next Call of Duty could lose some sales to Battlefront. Released around the same time, and in the same genre, the games are likely to compete for the same sort of gamers.
Already, Call of Duty is showing some signs of franchise fatigue. The latest installment -- Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare -- was 2014's single-best selling game, but demand for the series appears to have peaked. Yet, Activision has a plan to reinvigorate the series: Treyarch.  
Although all Call of Duty installments bear a similarity, Activision uses three different studios to create the series. Treyarch is making 2015's installment, which could result in a quality entry. Treyarch's past Call of Duty games -- particularly Black Ops and Black Ops II -- have been among the game's best received. The studio should additionally benefit from a three-year development cycle -- only the second Call of Duty game to do so.
Activision has other games to fall back onBut even if Treyarch's magic can't propel Call of Duty in 2015, Activision has other games to fall back on. World of Warcraft and Skylanders remain reliable cash cows, while Hearthstone and Destiny provide potential upside.
As an Activision shareholder with a long-term perspective, Star Wars: Battlefront doesn't frighten me enough to sell. That said, Activision investors should be aware of the threat, and perhaps be willing to ride out a bumpy winter if Battlefront, does, indeed, steal Call of Duty sales.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) shares have been on fire as of late: Shares of the video game publisher are up more than 130% in the last year alone. That gain comes on a series of strong earnings reports. Most recently, Electronic Arts exceeded analyst expectations for the third quarter, posting better-than-expected revenue and earnings.
In its subsequent earnings call, Electronic Arts management touched on a number of positive trends that are supporting its business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that call.
Electronic Arts is seeing strong demand for nearly all of its gamesAs a publisher of video games, Electronic Arts' performance depends entirely on the success of its titles. Within the industry, Electronic Arts is well-diversified, with franchises in most genres, and games on most platforms, including mobile.
On the call, its CEO Andrew Wilson noted that the business appears to be strong on all fronts, with demand for its titles up across the board.
""Dragon Age: Inquisition was named to more than 200 Game of the Year lists ... More than 6 million people on average were playing FIFA games every week ... Madden NFL Mobile had its biggest day in franchise history on Christmas Day, reaching number four on the top grossing charts in the U.S. Apple App Store. And we finished the calendar year as the world's leading console ... publisher.""
The Ultimate Team initiative is paying offElectronic Arts' sports franchises (Madden, FIFA, NHL, UFC etc) benefit from yearly refreshes, but have suffered from a degree of cyclicality in the past, with interest waning in between annual releases.
But Electronic Arts has found a way to drive engagement year-round: Ultimate Team. Pioneered with its FIFA franchise, Ultimate Team has come to the majority of Electronic Arts sports titles, including Madden. With Ultimate Team, players build fantasy squads of elite players. Ultimate Team gives players a reason to play their favorite Electronic Arts sports title months after release, and benefits Electronic Arts through additional digital revenue. Wilson noted that engagement in Ultimate Team continues to be on the rise.
""Ultimate Team ... engagement is deeper than ever. The total number of players entering Ultimate Team across FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15 and NHL 15 has increased nearly 45% year-over-year.""
Electronic Arts should benefit from Episode 7Electronic Arts will release the next installment in its popular Battlefield franchise in March, but its 2015 marquee title is likely to be Star Wars: Battlefront.
Unfortunately, Electronic Arts hasn't given an exact release date for the game, but it's likely to debut sometime in November or December. Electronic Arts' management believes the game will be a blockbuster, as it should benefit from the release of Star Wars: Episode 7 (slated to open in theaters Dec. 18).
""We've got a ... Star Wars title coming in before Christmas next year, aligned with the Star Wars movie ... We're extremely excited about that and we think there is huge potential for that title ... you should consider that a very large activity for us next year and very large focus, similar to how we thought about Battlefield [games] in the past.""
Be wary of NPD dataResearch firm NPD tracks monthly U.S. video game sales, and its data is commonly seen as a strong indicator of the overall strength of the industry. Recent NPD data has been weak, with demand for video games seemingly declining on an annual basis for most of the last year.
However, Electronic Arts' CFO, Blake Jorgensen, warned investors to be cautious when considering NPD's data, as the firm does not track digital or international sales. With a growing number of Electronic Arts' games sold digitally, NPD is becoming increasingly irrelevant.
""Be really careful using NPD data, it's becoming less and less valuable, as more and more of the business is going digital ... both in volume and in pricing, it can be sometimes a very large distraction. And then when you add in that there is no international piece to it -- it really underestimates the strength of our business.""
More capital returns could be forthcomingElectronic Arts has nearly $3 billion of cash on its balance sheet, as of the end of last quarter. The company doesn't pay a dividend, but has been willing to return cash to shareholders via share repurchases.
When prompted, Jorgensen reiterated Electronic Arts' commitment to return cash to shareholders whenever possible.
""We're very committed to continuing to buyback stock. We are on track to be able to complete the $750 million two-year buyback, and as we generate more cash we'll consider greater buybacks ... I think we just have a simple model, which is saying how do we get [the cash] back to shareholders.""

            ","In December, I named Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) CEO Andrew Wilson the greatest tech CEO of 2014. Wilson's efforts to transform the video game publisher produced strong returns for investors, as Electronic Arts shares doubled in 2014.
The rally continues: In after-hours trading on Tuesday, Electronic Arts shares rose more than 4% following the release of its third-quarter results. Electronic Arts continues to perform at a high level, as gamers eagerly snap up its titles.
Digital continues to accelerateOn an adjusted basis, Electronic Arts generated $1.428 billion in the third quarter -- more than the $1.275 billion it had previously projected, and more than the $1.29 billion consensus analyst estimate. Nearly half of that amount -- $693 million -- was from digitally distributed content (rather than physical discs). On a trailing-12-month basis, more than 50% of Electronic Arts' revenue is now coming from digital sales.
The bulk of that digital revenue is from the sale of extra content -- primarily DLC add-ons, which give gamers additional levels, weapons, and other content for their existing games. Sales of that extra content rose 47% on an annual basis.
Sales of full-game downloads (which replace physical discs entirely) also continue to ramp up, rising 22% on an annual basis to account for about one-fifth of Electronic Arts' digital revenue. Electronic Arts' other digital sources -- mobile and subscriptions -- had less of an impact on a percentage basis but also rose, up 13% and 52%, respectively.
The strong demand for Electronic Arts' games and digital services translated into better-than-expected earnings: In the third quarter, Electronic Arts earned an adjusted $1.22 -- better than the $0.90 it had previously guided, and more than $0.92 consensus analyst estimate.
Dragon Age: Inquisition breaks recordsDragon Age: Inquisition was Electronic Arts' premier title in the fourth quarter. The role-playing game doesn't have the sort of broad-based appeal of Electronic Arts' popular Madden and Battlefield franchises, but it still managed to set records for Electronic Arts' BioWare studio. It also earned numerous Game of the Year Awards for 2014, increasing Electronic Arts' cache among core gamers.
Mobile games are seeing increased engagementElectronic Arts is the leader in sports-based video games, with several core franchises including NHL, Madden, UFC, and FIFA. Although these franchises primarily serve console gamers, Electronic Arts has released some of them for mobile platforms.
Those mobile sports games are seeing increasing popularity: In the third quarter, monthly active players for Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team rose 45% on an annual basis. In total, Electronic Arts' mobile games averaged 160 million monthly active users in the third quarter.
In addition to its sports franchises, Electronic Arts has brought several of its other franchises to mobile. In December, it launched SimCity BuildIt -- a mobile adaptation of its long-running PC franchise, SimCity.
Benefiting from the new console cycle and a digital shiftOverall, the third quarter was strong for Electronic Arts, and its near-term prospects appear quite bullish. In calendar year 2014, Electronic Arts was the top publisher on both next-generation consoles -- PlayStation 4 and Xbox One -- and that could continue for some time. In March, Electronic Arts will release the next installment in its Battlefield series, and later in the year, it will launch Star Wars: Battlefront in concert with the debut of Star Wars: Episode 7.
The past 12 months have been great for Electronic Arts' shareholders, and as the current console cycle continues to ramp up, the video game publisher could continue to reward investors.

            ","The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) market index gained 12% in 2014. That's pretty much in line with the market's 12% to 13% annual returns over the long term. As always, some stocks ran ahead of the pack, raising the market's average returns.
Here are three of last year's biggest winners in the tech sector, including a couple of unexpected surprises. Video game publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) more than doubled in price, while high-tech materials maker Corning (NYSE:GLW) and social networking giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) crushed the market in a kinder, gentler way.
 Source: King of Hearts, via Wikimedia Commons.
The college of market-beating arts and sciencesStarting at the top, Electronic Arts delivered a shocking 105% gain in 2014 -- right on the heels of a 66% return in 2013.
This is largely an industrywide trend, as video game designers ride the support of recently updated consoles. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) nearly doubled over these two years, and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) gained an even stronger 160%.
But of course, none of them can hold a candle to Electronic Arts' sector-leading 242% gains, including the 105% last-year surge mentioned above.
Fellow Fool Sam Mattera pinpoints the company's fantastic performance to the hiring of CEO Andrew Wilson in the fall of 2013. Wilson has turned around a terrible public image with the help of a smart sales and marketing revamp, latching on to digital distribution methods in a big way.
Thanks to Wilson's sharp thinking and execution, Electronic Arts is delivering consistent earnings and sharply rising cash flows, underpinning the big market move with solid fundamentals.
If you saw this market-crushing year coming when Wilson took the CEO job -- an unheralded internal promotion, and not even the most likely Electronic Arts veteran for the post -- your crystal ball is way better than mine. Now, the stock looks poised to continue beating the market, fueled by Wilson's new-age strategy and starting from reasonable share prices of just 14 times trailing free cash flows.
How much longer will this be the social network?If Electronic Arts flew under the radar to get to the top, Facebook followed more of an open path. The social network beat back skeptics like yours truly by making large strides in mobile ad sales and delivering increasingly solid profits. Facebook's stock followed suit with a solid 43% gain.
Facebook is becoming a must-have advertising platform and a peerless viral marketing vehicle. My Foolish peers think it's just the beginning of a lasting trend, too.
Tim Brugger believes the stock can soar even higher in 2015, driven by efforts to make money from its splashy $2.7 billion Instagram buyout.
Brian Stoffel goes even further, calling Facebook a market-beater for the next decade. Why? Because founder and leader Mark Zuckerberg has a knack for finding the next big trend before the rest of us got tired of the last one. Instagram is just one example of this deep vision; Oculus Rift might be the next big winner.
This being the Motley Fool, I don't have to agree with my colleagues. My thumbs-down rating on Facebook is currently the biggest loser in my CAPS portfolio, but I have no plans to turn that frown upside down.
I'm impressed by Zuckerberg's success in 2014, but not convinced that he can keep the good times rolling. The social media market has a history of sudden, violent upheavals, and the younger generation is already showing signs of getting bored with current leader Facebook. If and when they move on to the next global water cooler, turning Facebook into the next MySpace (Ouch!) or Friendster (Who? Exactly!), I'd hate to have that stock in my retirement portfolio.
Facebook may make it through 2015 without hitting that brutal event. But for every year Facebook continues to lead its core market of social networking, I'm more convinced that it might be the last one. Don't back up the truck to this stock -- make sure you can afford to lose whatever you put into it.
Flat-out speedRounding out this market-beating rally, Corning turned a corner in 2014 with a 32% return on your investment.
Its mobile screen-cover dominance was threatened by up-and-coming sapphire alternatives, until that threat literally fell apart. Meanwhile, Corning presented even thinner and stronger Gorilla Glass products for mobile applications and made a play for large-screen television screens. That timing of that last move could prove prophetic if consumers around the world start upgrading their TV sets to next-generation 4K screens in 2015, as they very well might.
Until then, Corning investors can revel in a hockey-stick growth curve for the glassware veteran's cash flows. Despite Corning's huge share price gains in 2014, the market might still not have factored in all of its refreshed cash-making proficiency, not to mention the growth drivers already discussed:

GLW Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts.
Corning has close ties to the unstoppable mobile computing market, but it doesn't live and die by that industry alone. If you're looking for a proven veteran with diverse end-user markets and a rocket plume of momentum at its back, Corning might be worth a second look today.

            ","GameStop's (NYSE:GME) business model is broken, and the company has yet to find a solution.
Shares of the video game retailer plunged following the release of its third quarter earnings last week. New video game software sales -- GameStop's second-largest profit driver -- fell 9.3% on an annual basis. GameStop blamed a difficult comparison for the decline: last year's third quarter saw the release of Destiny, a much-hyped (though critically maligned) first-person shooter. The release of Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) Madden NFL 16, Metal Gear Solid 5, Halo 5, and Guitar Hero Live (among other games) were not enough to equal the demand for Destiny last year -- at least according to GameStop's management.
I've been a longtime GameStop bear and remain skeptical of the stock. The popularity of full-game downloads continues to increase, and GameStop's management is unable to address the threat.
Dodging the questionGameStop's business centers around the sale of video game discs, both new and used. Last quarter, 33.5% and 24.9% of GameStop's net sales came from new video games and used video games, respectively. GameStop sells new video game discs to consumers, and then buys them back later, only to resell them for a sizable profit. More than one-third of GameStop's total gross profit came from the sale of used games last quarter.
Source: GameStop third quarter earnings release
The continued shift toward digital downloads presents an existential threat to this model. If all (or most) video games are sold digitally in the form of a direct download, there's no disc for GameStop to sell (and then eventually resell).During GameStop's earnings call, Sterne Agee's Arvind Bhatia asked management what the company could do to crack into this market -- which, according to Electronic Arts, now represents about 20% of new game sales.
Bhatia: What do you think is your market share in digital downloads?...how do you become more of a destination place for digital downloads...?
GameStop CEO Paul Raines: I would say that, remember, that we are a player in digital downloads. I mean you don't do $228 million of digital receipts without having technologies, APIs, relationships, and all those things that you need to sell digital download...
GameStop COO Tony Bartel: Let me share some of that, Arvind. We don't give out specific market share of digital downloads or digital receipts, simply because it's really difficult to find that information. But let me give you some information from DFC...we find it to be one of the most credible source when we..look at digital share...According to DFC, in the third quarter, digital AAA sales for $60 game releases increased 6% over last year to 6% in total. And it represented only 9% of the total AAA sales mix. So that's coming from a source that we find very credible. So it grew 6% off of a very small base....
Raines: And you know the difficulty, of course, here is that digital is a complex animal and people, every publisher measures it in slightly different ways, et cetera... 
Bartel: ...And we anticipate that digital is going to continue to grow. And remember, that we grew 14% before [foreign-exchange], which is right in line with where the publishers grew. So we continue to see our digital continue to march forward at about the same rate that the publishers are seeing their digital growth.
In short: nothing. Rather than address Bhatia's question, GameStop's management stepped around it, offering no plan or strategy to capture demand for downloads. Instead, the company attempted to downplay the popularity of full-game downloads, and pointed to total digital receipts -- which is misleading. GameStop's digital business is composed of many different types of products, including pre-paid currency cards that can be used to purchase digital games through the various console storefronts, and Kongregate, its mobile game publishing platform.
The bulk of GameStop's digital business is likely coming from the sale of add-on (DLC) content. In recent years, major video game publishers have begun to supplement their games with additional downloadable content released several months after a game's debut. GameStop sells this content alongside physical game discs, encouraging customers who purchase a new game to pay for its DLC at the point of sale.
The issue is that these DLC sales are intrinsically linked to the demand for discs, and if gamers stop coming into GameStop's stores, there's no reason to believe this business will survive. I can't say for certain because GameStop won't disclose it, but I would assume it sells virtually no full-game downloads at all. There's simply no reason to purchase a full-game download through GameStop when you can just buy it through your Xbox or PlayStation console. To use an analogy, it would be the equivalent of going to Blockbuster to purchase a code for a digital movie you then redeem on iTunes -- an utterly nonsensical proposition.
Star Wars disappoints GameStop, but sets a digital recordEA's Star Wars: Battlefront wasn't included in GameStop's third quarter report, but will play a key role in its fourth quarter results. It made its debut earlier this month, and according to GameStop, suffered from soft sales. ""Battlefront fell short of expectations,"" said Bartel during the call.
But did it fall short of Electronic Arts' expectations? In a blog post released (perhaps not so coincidentally) shortly after GameStop's call, Electronic Arts wrote that the game was ""the largest digital launch in the history"" of the company. Rather than head to GameStop for their copy of Battlefront, gamers may have stayed home, purchasing it directly through their consoles.
GameStop is profitable, and pays a fairly sizable dividend (it currently yields more than 3.5%), but with so much of its sales and profit tied to video game discs, it remains immensely challenged.

            ","Brewer Constellation Brands was one favorite of this hedge-fund giant. Image source: Constellation Brands.
Many individual investors look to professional hedge-fund managers for ideas on smart stocks to buy. Lone Pine Capital has been a successful hedge fund for years, with Steve Mandel at the helm directing its investments. In its latest release of its holdings, Lone Pine revealed that it had made some big acquisitions, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). With Lone Pine having built up positions that were worth more than $1.9 billion at the end of September, individual investors can see evidence of Mandel's confidence in these three stocks. Let's look more closely at what Lone Pine did and whether these three stocks make sense for you.
Betting big on e-commerce Lone Pine's new position in Amazon.com is its biggest of the quarter, with the company building up a 1.94 million share position in the e-commerce giant. That made Lone Pine's stake in the company worth nearly $1 billion, making up more than 4% of its almost $25 billion portfolio of reportable holdings. Lone Pine has had investments in Amazon in the past, but they have tended to be opportunistic and short-term in nature.
Amazon has long been a controversial stock, as its revenue growth hasn't yet resulted in the level of profitability that many investors would prefer to see. Recently, Amazon has appeared to take steps to start remedying that situation, with the stock soaring more than 22% in October after the company reported more than half a billion dollars in operating income solely from its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing and web-hosting service. Investors have been willing to accept that Amazon's future promise justifies an ever-increasing share price even in the absence of more substantial profits, and Lone Pine appears to see the company as representative of the hedge fund's broader commitment to disruptive technology companies.
Brewing up big gains? Constellation Brands represents a more modest investment for Lone Pine, but the position that the hedge fund took involves a larger percentage of the beer and spirits-maker's market capitalization. Lone Pine bought more than 4.68 million shares of Constellation Brands, building up a 2.7% position that was worth more than $586 million at quarter-end. Unlike with Amazon, Lone Pine hasn't dabbled in Constellation stock in the past.
Constellation has moved aggressively toward building up its beer portfolio. After a major acquisition of brands Corona and Modelo in 2013, Constellation just announced the $1 billion buyout of craft-beer company Ballast Point Brewing. Ballast Point will add 40 beer brands to Constellation's lineup, including the well-regarded Sculpin India pale ale. Other major players have made big moves in the beer space lately, and Constellation hopes that greater exposure to craft beer will put it in better position to keep its competitive edge going forward.
Winning the game Lone Pine's investment in video game manufacturer Electronic Arts wasn't a new purchase, but the hedge fund dramatically increased its stake. Lone Pine's purchase of nearly 8 million shares during the quarter brought its total holdings to 8.78 million shares, and the shares that the hedge fund bought was worth about $541 million at the end of the quarter.
EA has profited greatly from long-running franchises like Madden NFL and other sports-related games, but a lot of the buzz surrounding the video game maker lately has come from its latest installment of its Battlefield series, which incorporates a licensing agreement that allowed it to take place in the Star Wars universe and was released in mid-November. Given the upcoming release of new movies in the Star Wars franchise, EA expected huge demand for the game, and many investors immediately concluded that Star Wars: Battlefield would become a multiyear success with plenty of potential for future sequels. The company is being smart about managing those expectations, but EA could nevertheless enjoy nice gains riding Star Wars coattails.
Lone Pine's buys are diverse and show the scope that Mandel and his team have in looking for good prospects. Each of these three stocks looks promising and could fit well in the stock portfolios of many individual investors.

            ","Shares of video game publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA)  fell after retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) reported weak third-quarter earnings on Nov 23. GameStop stock plunged as much as 16% that day, while EA stock slid about 6%. It might seem logical to dump a game publisher's stock after a major game retailer misses earnings expectations, but it doesn't really make much sense due to the differences between physical and digital distribution.

How bad was GameStop's quarter?Last quarter, GameStop's revenue fell 3.6% annually to $2.02 billion and missed estimates by $120 million. Net income fell 11.4% to $57 million, or $0.54 per share, which missed expectations by $0.05. Same-store sales declined 1.1% annually, compared to an increase of 8.1% in the second quarter.

At first glance, it looks like sales of consoles and video games are falling across the board. However, console sales were expected to slow down, since the PS4 and Xbox One have both been on the market for two years. Sales of physical software were also expected to fall, due to the growth of digital distribution channels. GameStop's digital games revenue also shouldn't be considered a bellwether for the digital market, since many gamers download games directly from the PlayStation Store, Xbox One Game Store, or Steam.
Simply put, customers buy consoles from GameStop, but they gradually lose touch with the retailer as the hardware ages. These customers then cut GameStop out of the sales loop by buying games through other digital distribution channels. GameStop is trying to counter this trend by offering more digital downloads and diversifying into consumer electronics, but those businesses still generate a small percentage of its overall revenue.
Why EA is differentUnlike GameStop, Electronic Arts has made a fairly smooth transition to the digital gaming model. Last quarter, non-GAAP packaged goods revenue (58% of sales) fell 13% to $666 million, but digital revenues (42% of sales) rose 6% annually to $480 million. Sixteen percent of those digital revenues came from full game downloads, 42% came from extra content like DLCs, 17% came from subscriptions and advertising, and 25% came from mobile games.
EA earned 74.5% of its revenues from consoles during the quarter. In addition to selling digital games through the PlayStation and Xbox One Stores, it recently partnered with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to deliver cloud-based games to TVs via its X1 set-top boxes. That partnership enables Xfinity subscribers to use a mobile device as a controller to play EA games streamed over the Internet. Last year, EA introduced EA Access, a subscription-based service which grants Xbox One gamers unlimited access to select titles. These initiatives will ensure that digital revenues flow from living rooms back to EA.

EA Access. Source: EA.
On PCs, EA sells its digital games through Origin, a Steam-like DRM platform which has over 50 million users. By keeping its games within this walled garden, EA maintains tighter control over pricing. It is also reportedly planning an EA Access-like subscription service for Origin. EA's PC/browser revenues accounted for 14.4% of its sales last quarter.
EA's total non-GAAP revenues fell 5.7% annually last quarter to $1.15 billion, which still beat estimates by $50 million. That slowdown wasn't surprising, due to currency headwinds and tough comparisons to last year, when The Sims 4 launched. But looking ahead, EA expects a strong holiday quarter thanks to the launch of Star Wars: Battlefront. For that quarter, EA expects non-GAAP EPS of $1.75 on revenue of $1.78 billion, which exceeds the consensus estimate for EPS of $1.73 on $1.75 billion in revenue.
Comparing apples to orangesGameStop and EA run on very different business models: Sluggish sales of new hardware and software at GameStop doesn't mean that sales of all games are sliding -- it just means that the distribution model is changing.
This doesn't necessarily mean that EA is an ideal investment at current prices. EA has high expectations for the holiday quarter, but the period could still be rough on margins due to steep discounts and the aggressive bundling of top games with new consoles. However, investors shouldn't sell EA simply because GameStop had a rough quarter.

            ","Video game giant Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) posted strong fiscal second quarter results, beating both its own guidance and analyst expectations. Yet shares fell following the release, as its outlook may not have been as optimistic as investors anticipated. During the subsequent earnings call, CEO Andrew Wilson, CFO Blake Jorgensen, and COO Peter Moore commented on a number of trends affecting the business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that discussion.
A different strategy for mobile gamesThe bulk of Electronic Arts' business continues to come from more traditional gaming platforms -- consoles and the PC. But Electronic Arts does have a respectable mobile business. Mobile games generated around 10% of its revenue on an adjusted basis last quarter. During the call, Wilson discussed a strategic shift the company made this quarter and how it affected one of its more popular mobile titles:
Madden NFL Mobile launched a full-game update this year instead of a new app download. The result was a seamless experience for players, which increased retention and resulted in game sessions up more than 300% over last year.
Demand for EA Access is risingLast July, Electronic Arts announced EA Access, a digital subscription service that gave Xbox One owners the ability to, for a flat monthly or annual fee, play a collection of older Electronic Arts titles. EA Access subscribers also get a discount on new releases and early access to upcoming games. However, Electronic Arts has not offered up exact subscriber figures, instead lumping it with its subscriptions and advertising revenue. That figure contracted slightly on an annual basis last quarter, from 91 million to 83 million on an adjusted basis, but EA Access may not have been responsible for that decline. During the call, Wilson commented on the service's growth in general:
EA Access is accelerating. The subscriber base more than doubled in the last two quarters. We've added five new games to The Vault this year, and we're excited about what we're learning as players engage through this service. These titles ... are giving us strong momentum moving into the holiday season.
On guidanceElectronic Arts raised its guidance for its full fiscal year, but its revenue outlook fell slightly short of analyst estimates. Mirror's Edge Catalyst was expected to debut in Electronic Arts' fiscal fourth quarter, but it has been delayed until May, shifting it out of the fiscal year. During the call, Jorgensen explained Electronic Arts' outlook:
Due to our continued strong performance, we are again increasing our full-year outlook. The open beta for Star Wars: Battlefront was exceptionally well received by players. Consequently, we're raising our unit forecast for sell-in during fiscal year 2016 to approximately 13 million units. This is partially offset by increased FX headwinds and our decision to move Mirror's Edge Catalyst into fiscal 2017.
The popularity of full-game downloads is increasing but not in every regionElectronic Arts' console games are its largest segment by revenue. Console games are still sold primarily on physical discs, but in the past, management has expressed its interest in eventually converting entirely to digital. Owners of modern consoles have the option to download games rather than buy a disc. During the call, Jorgensen commented on the trends the company is seeing in full-game downloads.
Our new titles in the quarter averaged around 20% full-game downloads with the exception of FIFA, which skewed lower [because of its European popularity]. ... In terms of the full-game downloads, a couple things to remember; we still sell [PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 games], and [gamers who own those consoles] are typically doing full-game downloads [less often]. ... Second, our [second-quarter] business, particularly FIFA, is skewed heavily toward Europe, and two factors bring down full-game downloads ... in Europe. One is bandwidth speeds in some countries. And two is many retailers in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, use FIFA as a way of driving traffic into the store, and they like a physical copy to help do that. We're seeing very strong full-game downloads continue in North America. ... [For PC games] we see full-game downloads there roughly 75%. ... We believe in the full-game download opportunity for us going forward.
Battlefront 2 in 2016?Electronic Arts will release Star Wars: Battlefront on Nov. 17. It should be one of the most popular games released this year. Could it become an annual franchise for Electronic Arts? During the call, Wilson commented on that possibility, suggesting that it probably wouldn't be the case but that the company's commitment to Star Wars is only just beginning.
Around Star Wars and annualization -- again, what we have talked about is we have a long-term partnership around the Star Wars license, and we expect that we will launch many titles as part of that long-term relationship. ... We still have 6 million people engaging regularly in both Battlefield 4 [released in 2013] and Battlefield Hardline [released earlier this year]. ... We think about our business not just as a launch business, but as a large service and relationship business that we factor in when it's appropriate to launch new things. ... Certainly, expect more Star Wars titles from us, but no decision made as to specific timing as yet.

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) shares were down 4% at 10:55 a.m. Friday following the release on Thursday of the video-game giant's fiscal-second-quarter earnings report. Electronic Arts earned an adjusted $0.65 per share on adjusted revenue of $1.146 billion.
Both figures handily beat analyst expectations. Wall Street had been expecting Electronic Arts to earn around $0.45 per share on sales of around $1.10 billion. Let's take a closer look at Electronic Arts' results.
Raising guidance -- againThe negative response to Electronic Arts' earnings report may have been predicated on the company's outlook. Although Electronic Arts raised its full-year outlook for the second time this year, it still fell slightly short of analyst estimates. For fiscal year 2016, which ends next March, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $3.00 per share on revenue of around $4.5 billion. Analysts had projected Electronic Arts to earn less (around $2.96 per share), but bring in more revenue -- around $4.53 billion.
Next quarter, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $1.75 per share on adjusted revenue of around $1.775 billion. Analysts had been anticipating earnings of around $1.74 on revenue of around $1.74 billion.
It's worth noting, however, that Electronic Arts' management has been particularly conservative in recent quarters, guiding to numbers that they seem to always handily beat. This quarter, in particular, Electronic Arts crushed its own estimates -- its adjusted earnings per share of $0.65 was well above its $0.40 guidance, while its adjusted net revenue of $1.146 billion was a bit more than its $1.075 billion forecast. Despite the decline, Electronic Arts' shares are up more than 200% in the last two years. Investors may have simply expected more from a company that's been firing on all cylinders.
Dominating the next generationIn the West, Electronic Arts has been the top publisher on both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One this year. Electronic Arts drew particular attention to its annual sports franchises to explain its success -- in particular, strong demand for FIFA and Madden NFL have benefited the company. This quarter, Electronic Arts released three sports titles -- NHL 16, FIFA 16, and Madden NFL 16 -- and monthly average players for the three titles rose 30% on an annual basis.
Revenue from the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 rose 48% on an annual basis, although demand for Electronic Arts' titles on older platforms saw a similar decline. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 revenue declined 43%, and those consoles now generate less than one-third as much adjusted revenue for Electronic Arts as their successors. Adjusted console revenue in total rose 5% on an annual basis.
Electronic Arts' PC revenue also notably declined, falling 38% on an adjusted basis. This was likely due to the release of the Sims 4 last September -- this year, Electronic Arts had no similar PC title, making a comparison difficult. Adjusted mobile revenue experienced a slight decline, falling 6%.
Digital takes a larger slice of the pieElectronic Arts' sales from digital channels -- as opposed to physical game discs by traditional retailers -- climbed to 42% of Electronic Arts' adjusted revenue, from 37% in the same quarter last year. Full-game downloads were flat, at 8%, but sales of extra DLC rose to 17% of adjusted revenue (from 13% last year), and packaged goods fell to 58% (from 63% in the same quarter last year). The move to digital is beneficial for the company's margins, and Electronic Arts executives have previously said they intend to eventually derive 100% of their revenue from digital channels.
Overall, it was a fairly boring quarter for the company -- not particularly phenomenal or discouraging. Next quarter, with the important holiday shopping season and the launch of Star Wars: Battlefront, should be more interesting.

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is about to release what could become the best-selling video game of the year.
Star Wars Battlefront is a first-person shooter from Electronic Arts' DICE studio, the longtime maker of the popular Battlefield franchise. It's slated to make its retail debut on Nov. 17, about one month before the release of next Star Wars film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Given the fervor currently surrounding all things Star Wars, Battlefront seems likely to smash Electronic Arts's expectations, which have been fairly modest.
Around 9 million or 10 million copiesTo date, management's guidance for Battlefront has been conservative. In May, CFO Blake Jorgensen said Electronic Arts expected to sell around 9 million to 10 million copies of the game, based on the relative success similar titles have had in the past.
Battlefield doesn't carry the Star Wars branding, but it offers a similar experience -- both games are team-based, first-person military shooters. Generally, those games sell around 15 million copies. Some Battlefield players could be turned off by the science fiction theme of Battlefront, but many longtime Battlefield players seem likely to convert.
The other game worth keeping in mind is the original Star Wars: Battlefront. That game was released in 2004, about eight months before the release of the film Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. It was made by a different game studio, released by LucasArts, and was a slightly different sort of game (a third-person shooter), but it does offer some hints as to what level of success can be expected from this new Battlefront. It sold 9 million copies.
In July, Electronic Arts raised its full-year guidance. Management said Battlefront played a key role in that shift, but declined to update its expectations in terms of unit sales. Notably, Battlefront will be exclusive to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC -- owners of the older Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles will not be able to play the game. Unfortunately, that may eliminate many potential buyers. But not too many.
Demand for Star Wars has been unprecedentedTwo years after their debuts, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have combined to sell perhaps 40 million units (the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 25 million; Xbox One sales have not been officially confirmed, but estimates peg the number at between 10 million and 15 million) and millions more may be sold this holiday shopping season. In March, Electronic Arts released the most recent installment in the Battlefield series, Battlefield: Hardline. According to the company, about 80% of the game's sales were for the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One platforms.
Star Wars mania has undeniably pervaded popular culture, and the game should benefit from the release of the latest film. Ticket sales for The Force Awakens have already smashed existing pre-sale records, and some analysts expect the film to eventually generate as much as $2 billion worldwide. Fans excited from watching the latest trailer could turn to Battlefront to satisfy their Star Wars itch in the weeks leading up to its launch.
There's other evidence to suggest Battlefront should perform exceptionally well. Earlier this month, Electronic Arts ran a test of the game's servers, allowing players to try the game for free. It wasn't meant to advertise, but rather ensure that Electronic Arts' online infrastructure could support it. Over 9.5 million players participated -- more than any other beta test in Electronic Arts' history -- with two-thirds achieving the max level cap (suggesting they had invested at least several hours). This was particularly impressive given that the game was only available to play for a few days.
Electronic Arts continues to reward shareholdersElectronic Arts shareholders could be rewarded for Battlefront's success before the game is even released. The video game publisher will report its quarterly earnings Thursday afternoon, and it could raise its guidance even further to reflect heightened excitement around Battlefront.
To be fair, Battlefront does face some tough competition this fall -- both Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and Halo 5 will offer first-person shooter fans strong alternatives -- but based on the excitement around the revival of the film franchise, there's every reason to expect the game to be a massively popular seller.

It's been five years since Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) hung up its stringless six-string, but it's never too late to start strumming again. Guitar Hero Live hits stores on Tuesday, and with that comes the hope that musical-timing games rock back into fashion. 
Activision Blizzard had a hit on its hands a decade ago. It was the publisher for the original Guitar Hero, developed by RedOctane and Harmonix in 2005. It liked what it saw, snapping up RedOctane two years later. Harmonix would go on to be acquired by MTV Games, turning to Activision Blizzard rival Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) to distribute its competing Rock Band franchise. 
Gamers ate up the niche, for a few years at least. Players took to guitars, microphones, and faux drum kits as controllers. Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts were the toast of the town. The genre breathed new life into the gaming market at a time when the Wii was already getting gamers to stand up and move. Small-box specialty retailers may have resisted at first. They had to give up shelf and storage space that was once dedicated to new and secondhand games to make room for bulky plastic guitars and drum kits. However, once the games started selling and crowds started to gather to watch folks play air guitar, it helped spark a retail revolution. 
By the time Activision Blizzard seemed to have milked the last bit of amp juice out of the franchise, it had spawned six generations of the game, as well as the short-lived DJ Hero and Band Hero spinoffs. Sales peaked in 2008, and by the time that the final entry rolled out in 2010 it was a fair bet that we would never be collecting guitar controllers again.
Well, that can all change on Tuesday. Guitar Hero Live is an evolutionary upgrade, offering an enhanced live concert experience. There are dozens of songs to cycle through, and folks can go online for roughly 200 more freely available tracks to play. If you're eyeing an opportunity to reconnect with all of the old Guitar Hero controllers collecting dust in your closet, you're out of luck. Guitar Hero Live features a totally new six-button fret interface. 
If this is a hit, we're talking about a lot of money spent on new hardware, and Activision Blizzard can certainly use that. Its revenue peaked in 2012. With once iconic franchises including Skylanders, World of Warcraft, and Guitar Hero sliding in popularity, it would be a real game changer if it's able to give its guitar-pecking series a second act. 
It's throwing plenty of marketing muscle behind the move. It's taking a page out of the Electronic Arts playbook by bringing in celebrities to pump up excitement. The promotional trailer stars Lenny Kravitz and James Franco in an amusing exchange. It's not the massive mini-movie effort that Electronic Arts used two months ago in trying to generate buzz for Madden 16, but it's a smart approach.
The game's coming. Now it's time to see if the encore is worthy of a standing ovation.

            ","Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) management had a lot to say on the company's first quarter earnings call.
CEO Andrew Wilson, CFO Blake Jorgensen, and COO Peter Moore commented on a variety of factors affecting Electronic Arts' business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that call.
More games are coming to the vaultLast year, Electronic Arts announced EA Access, a subscription-based digital service that gives Xbox One owners access to a variety of older Electronic Arts games for a relatively modest fee. Unfortunately, Electronic Arts does not break out the number of subscribers it has to the service, but during the call, Jorgensen highlighted the company's continued commitment.
""EA Access is delivering strong, sustained growth, and we continue to build its value to gamers as we add more games to the Vault. Titanfall is now in the Vault and Dragon Age: Inquisition will join it at the end of the summer, bringing the total titles to 13.""
Sims 4 and foreign exchangeElectronic Arts shares fell in after-hours trading on Thursday following the release of its first quarter results. Although they exceeded analyst expectations for the current quarter, its outlook fell short. During the call, Jorgensen offered up an explanation.
""Guidance for our second quarter is for [adjusted] net revenue to be $1.075 billion, 12% lower than last year's $1.22 billion. In this quarter, we're launching Madden NFL, FIFA, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, NHL and NBA Live. While last year's Q2 saw the launches of our major sports titles, it also included The Sims 4. In addition, FX presents a year on year impact of around $100 million to Q2 revenues.""
A strong slate of upcoming titlesAs a video game publisher, Electronic Arts' performance depends on the demand for its games. During the call, Wilson outlined several of the company's long-term projects.
""Looking further ahead, we're preparing more new games for our players. The reaction to a first look at Mass Effect: Andromeda at E3 was incredibly positive. We have a new Battlefield experience coming in Q3 FY 2017 and another new Star Wars project""
Star Wars will be a major part of EA's futureStars Wars: Battlefront could be the biggest game Electronic Arts releases this year. The first-person shooter is based on the long-running sci-fi series and is set to arrive in stores this November, ahead of the release of the next Star Wars film. But Electronic Arts' commitment to Star Wars involves much more than one game. During the call, Jorgensen hinted at additional titles.
""We don't have the timetable yet to announce those, but trust that you will see multiple Star Wars titles both on console and PC, as well as on mobile. We have at least one mobile title that's going to come out this year and we have more in the process as well. So lots to come on Star Wars, and you'll hear about that as we discuss our future guidance. We're very excited about the franchise and about our partnership.""
Free-to-play Titanfall probably won't be a big profit driverElectronic Arts released Titanfall for the Xbox One and PC in March of last year. An Xbox 360 version soon followed. Titanfall isn't a completely traditional first-person shooter, but it does adhere to traditional pricing -- if they wish to play it, gamers must pay to purchase it. But Electronic Arts will soon release a free-to-play version of Titanfall in Asia. When asked about this development, Moore made no sweeping promises. Instead, he characterized it as an experiment -- not a major new source of revenue.
""Think of this as a classic free-to-play game there, but do not think of this as being particularly material to revenue. It's an interesting experiment in looking at that type of game and whether it plays in a free-to-play environment. We'll be interested to see the results.""

            ","Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) cable box is now a video game console.
After months of speculation, the cable giant has officially unveiled its partnership with Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). Using a Comcast Internet connection and Xfinity X1 set-top box, customers can stream select gaming titles over the Internet to their televisions. Although the partnership may not disrupt the current console gaming landscape in the near-term, it represents an interesting new market and an opportunity -- both for Electronic Arts and for Comcast.

Comcast's cloud-based set-top box adds a new featureComcast's X1 set-top box is among the most advanced in the industry. Initially unveiled in 2012, the X1 supports voice commands, offers a cloud-based DVR and personalized recommendations, and can run third-party apps, including Pandora. Comcast's management has said it planned to improve the X1's features over time. Xfinity Games stands as the latest, and perhaps most significant, upgrade.
Players can choose from a catalog of select Electronic Arts titles, including Plants vs Zombies, FIFA 13, and NBA Jam. Games are played using tablets or smartphones connected over Wi-Fi rather than with standard controllers. Comcast's X1 isn't capable of actually running the games -- they're played on distant servers, then beamed over the Internet to subscribers' set-top boxes.
A way to stem subscriber losses?Currently, Comcast is offering the service for free to select participants in its beta test. That might eventually change to a model built around subscriptions.
Alternatively, Comcast could see additional revenue from increased data usage. On its Xfinity Games website, Comcast makes it clear that games streamed over its network count toward customers' Internet data caps. Comcast's cap varies based on region -- and it doesn't enforce a cap everywhere -- but where it is enforced, it charges an additional $10 per month for every 50GB used above the cap.
Xfinity Games could also serve as a way to keep Comcast's cable subscribers loyal. Earlier this month, Comcast revealed that it now has more Internet subscribers (22.6 million) than cable TV customers (22.3 million). Streaming video services and Internet-based, pay-TV alternatives have made living without cable an increasingly viable option. Those who want to take advantage of Xfinity Games, however, will need a Comcast set-top box and pay-TV subscription.
A new market for Electronic Arts' gamesFor Electronic Arts, Xfinity Games offers up a new avenue for revenue beyond its traditional console, PC, and mobile offerings. Electronic Arts has not disclosed how much Comcast is paying for the service, but may shed some light on the deal later this week when it turns in its quarterly earnings.
This service is not likely to affect Electronic Arts' results to a material degree in the near future, but if Xfinity Games proves popular, it could open up a new market. As it stands, Electronic Arts is limited in its ability to sell television-based games to those with relatively expensive game consoles. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 have sold tens of millions of units globally, but the majority of American households don't have either box. Some of those are undoubtedly Comcast TV subscribers who could be lured by the company's latest offering.
Last year, Electronic Arts launched EA Access, the first subscription-based game offering from a major publisher. Partnering with a cable provider to offer streaming games is another first for Electronic Arts and the industry in general. If nothing else, Xfinity Games demonstrates the increasing degree to which Electronic Arts' management is innovating.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) shares fell in after-hours trading on Thursday following the release of the company's fiscal-first-quarter earnings report. Although Electronic Arts beat analyst expectations for the current quarter, its outlook for the second quarter and full year proved disappointing. Let's dig in to Electronic Arts' report.
A strong quarter despite an empty release scheduleAs a video game publisher, Electronic Arts depends on the sale of its games to drive its financial performance. But the majority of Electronic Arts' titles are released in the fall and winter; in the first quarter, Electronic Arts published no new games of note.
Still, it earned an adjusted $0.15 per share on adjusted net revenue of $693 million. Analysts had expected Electronic Arts to earn just $0.03 on revenue of around $652 million. Management cited demand for games released in prior periods, as well as revenue related to its digital services.
Packaged goods -- physical CDs -- generated just 23% of Electronic Arts' adjusted net revenue in the first quarter, down from 38% in the same quarter last year. Full-game downloads rose to 12% from 9%, while DLC (downloadable content) grew to 37% from 27% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. Subscription-related revenue remained stable at 10%, and mobile revenue grew to 18% from 16% in the same quarter last year.
Given the lack of new titles in the first quarter, Electronic Arts focused on its upcoming slate. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in June, Electronic Arts' upcoming games won a combined 132 awards. Although these rewards mean little in terms of financial performance, they serve to underscore the relative strength of the company's pipeline.
But EA's outlook falls shortThursday's sell-off was likely fueled by Electronic Arts' outlook. Although it raised its full-year guidance, it still fell short of what analysts had been anticipating.
In fiscal year 2016, which ends in March 2016, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $2.85 per share on adjusted net revenue of $4.450 billion. Analysts had projected $2.87 per share on revenue of around $4.48 billion. More significant is Electronic Arts' second-quarter outlook. In that quarter, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $0.40 per share on adjusted net revenue of $1.075 billion. Analysts had expected quite a bit more -- $0.67 on revenue of $1.12 billion.
If recent history is any indication, Electronic Arts' guidance is likely extremely conservative. Electronic Arts' results exceeded management's expectations in every single quarter of its fiscal year 2015. In the fourth quarter, for example, Electronic Arts had guided for adjusted earnings of $0.22 per share on adjusted net revenue of $830 million. In reality, Electronic Arts earned an adjusted $0.39 on adjusted net revenue of $896 million. 
In recent quarters, Electronic Arts has been one of the best-performing tech stocks. Shares of the video game giant are up better than 100% in the last 12 months. The rally has been fueled by a steady stream of better-than-expected earnings reports -- in January, and again in May, shares surged following the release of quarterly results that exceeded expectations.

EA data by YCharts.
Demand for next-generation consoles has been strong, and Electronic Arts' multiple has risen along with its stock. With a trailing price-to-earnings ratio near 26, investors appear to be expecting strong growth.
The sell-off is a minor speed bump for longer-term shareholders, but not particularly surprising. Electronic Arts' business continues to perform, but given its valuation, any doubts about its future prospects will likely weigh on its shares.

5 Big Winners, data by YCharts.
The stock market is having a quiet year in 2015. The famed S&P 500 index is up a meager 2.3% since the New Year, and the Dow Jones Industrials index has lost 0.4%.
But there are always exceptions to the rule. We asked a panel of Motley Fool contributors to outline the five biggest surprises they've seen in 2015, and this is what they came up with.
Here, you'll find a few long-running turnaround stories such as video-game designer Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and casino operator Isle of Capri Casinos (NASDAQ:ISLE). Digital entertainment veteran Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), meanwhile, is going from strength to strength, and former bargain-bin shoe designer Skechers USA (NYSE:SKX) has become a powerhouse footwear brand in its own right. And what the heck is Natural Health Trends (NASDAQ:NHTC), other than a market-crushing titan in 2015? You'll soon find out.
These stocks have gained between 54% and 152% so far this year -- and that includes retreats from much loftier yearly highs in some cases. Dig into these juicy stock stories right here:
Image source: Netflix.
Brian Stoffel (Netflix): Let's consider where Netflix stood when it entered 2015. Although the company's stock had fallen 25% in the last three months of 2014, it still traded for a hefty valuation.
Shares were valued at 90 times trailing earnings, and Netflix hadn't produced positive free cash flow during the year. The company had just announced ambitious plans to expand to nearly every country on the map, and warned that it would take a while before its investments truly paid off.
Since then, the stock has more than doubled -- up an amazing 125% in just seven months' time. While it's still a mighty expensive holding -- now over 300 times trailing earnings -- the company's success at growing its subscriber base truly stands out.
Total global streaming subscriptions rose a whopping 30% to 65.5 million from the second quarter of 2014 to the same time frame this year. The biggest gains came outside the U.S. One year ago, there were 13.8 million international subscribers to Netflix services. That number has jumped almost 70% since then to 23.25 million. That kind of growth shows just how popular Netflix is with an international audience, and why the stock has done so well over such a short time frame.

Rich Duprey (Isle of Capri Casinos): For a casino operator that once seemed to be on its deathbed as the island gambling oasis of Macau off mainland China attracted betting and investment dollars, Isle of Capri Casinos has to be one of the most surprising turnaround stories -- not only of this year, but of the past few years.
The casino operator's recovery began last year, but has accelerated in earnest in 2015, with shares more than doubling since the start of the year.
Isle of Capri Casinos owns or operates 15 casinos in seven states, and strong performance has fueled its drive higher, with revenue and earnings topping analyst expectations. A continuously improving economy and more disposable cash in consumers' pockets have been big factors in helping the casino operator outpace even its thriving industry.
Unlike other bigger, more well-known players, Isle of Capri Casinos doesn't have exposure to Macau. Thus, when revenue there started to plummet last year after a crackdown on corruption, the U.S.-based operator, whose properties are mostly in secondary markets, was unfazed. This has helped its stock perform far better than its gaming peers.
There also doesn't appear to be any danger of the casino rolling snake eyes anytime soon, which makes Isle of Capri Casinos my most surprising stock of 2015.
ReStor Vital is one of Natural Health Trends' core brands. Image source: Natural Health Trends.
Anders Bylund (Natural Health Trends): Did you know that Natural Health Trends shares have soared 150% higher so far in 2015? That the stock is up a massive 250% over the last year?
More to the point -- did you know that Natural Health Trends existed before clicking on this article?
Natural Health Trends is a multi-level marketing firm, relying on a network of customers-slash-contractors to sell the company's products. You could think of the company as the Tupperware of beauty products and nutritional supplements. If you've run across brands such as Valura, Skindulgence, Premium Noni Juice, or ReStor Vital, you've seen Natural Health Trends in action. You just didn't necessarily know it at the time.
So why is this no-name business storming up the charts in 2015?
Well, Natural Health Trends is enjoying a golden age in international markets. Specifically, sales in Hong Kong accounted for 92% of the company's revenue in the recently reported first quarter, on the back of an 80% year-over-year sales increase. Hong Kong is the company's gateway into China -- a local shipping center for customers and marketing partners in the Chinese mainland.
With China playing such a crucial role in Natural Health Trends' business results via that Hong Kong link, the company itself is pretty much a proxy for that particular Far Eastern market. Overall, first-quarter sales increased 76%, and net income more than doubled.
That being said, Natural Health Trends remains a micro-cap stock with a market cap of just over $300 million. In spite of the massive gains in the stock's rearview mirror, the share price has actually fallen about 45% from its 52-week high, with half of that decline coming in the past week and a half.
The Chinese consumer market isn't looking terribly healthy at the moment, and in America, networks of so-called independent contractors may soon be reclassified as taxable and benefits-laden employees.
Natural Health Trends is a risky stock with absolutely zero analyst coverage. I mean, the company issued a celebratory press release when it was selected for inclusion in the Russell 3000 and Russell Microcap indices, which is a far cry from joining the Dow or the S&P 500.
Long story short: If you're looking for stability and future promise, Natural Health Trends may not be for you. But the stock is hard to beat when it comes to momentum-driven rocket tickers at the moment.
That counts as a major surprise in my book.

Dan Caplinger (Electronic Arts): It wasn't so long ago that many had declared the era of traditional video games dead, with the potential competition from mobile devices and other newer options threatening the viability of console-based video gaming. Yet Electronic Arts has defied calls for its early demise, with the stock vaulting higher by 57% so far in 2015 after roughly doubling in 2014.
Electronic Arts' renaissance came largely thanks to new hardware from the major game-console makers, which gave EA a chance to showcase its game-making capabilities. With core franchises including Battlefield, Dragon Age, and sports must-haves like the Madden series of football video games, Electronic Arts has attracted gamers of all ages.
At the same time, EA has addressed some of the quality concerns that its customers had, with new games like Titanfall getting critical acclaim. EA's subscription service has also had early success. It offers gamers a chance to try older titles that they otherwise wouldn't buy, but at a price they're willing to pay, generating recurring revenue for the company.
Given how far it climbed in 2014, EA didn't have many investors thinking 2015 would be equally impressive. For now, though, Electronic Arts is executing flawlessly, and that bodes well for its future prospects.

Tamara Walsh (Skechers): In the past, when you wanted to buy a pair of knock-off sneakers, Skechers was your one-stop shop. Today, however, the retailer has evolved from a cheap purveyor of off-brand footwear into the number two brand share position in the U.S. athletic footwear market. As if that isn't surprising enough, the stock has gained an eye-popping 124% so far in 2015. Shares are now trading at an all-time high around $124 per share.
Skechers shocked Wall Street earlier this year after delivering blowout first-quarter results in which sales climbed a record 40% to $768 million. Earnings for the period also topped expectations, coming in at $1.10 per share. The strong fiscal 2015 first-quarter results came on the heels of an annual sales record of $2.4 billion in 2014.
It seems Skechers has a winning formula. The company isn't shy about using celebrity endorsements to move its products, including deals with world famous drummer Ringo Starr, recording artist Demi Lovato, and legendary quarterbacks Joe Montana and Joe Namath, to name a few. With the stock now trading near an all-time high, investors may want to remain on the sidelines for now. Nonetheless, it will be interesting to see if Skechers continues to surprise us in the quarters ahead.

            ","The leisure products industry includes companies across multiple sectors, including toys, video games, sports equipment, and recreational vehicles. These stocks often rise when the economy is healthy, unemployment is low, and disposable income is high. They fall out of favor when the opposite happens, since they aren't considered as essential as food and clothing.

Let's take a look at two top stocks investors should watch in this industry -- toymaker Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) and video game publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).
HasbroShares of Hasbro have risen 56% over the past 12 months, while shares of rival Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) have plunged 34%. Last quarter, Hasbro's sales rose 5% annually on a constant currency basis, while Mattel's slipped 1%. Hasbro's net income improved 25%, but Mattel posted a net loss.
The reason for that disparity is simple -- Hasbro licenses hot franchises based on blockbuster films, while a large portion of Mattel's revenue comes from Barbie, an aging franchise which has lost its appeal with young girls. Last quarter, Hasbro posted 1% annual sales growth at its boys category, which accounted for 43% of its top line, thanks to strong demand for Jurassic World, Marvel, and Star Wars toys. The Jurassic World effect also lifted sales of its preschool products by 14% to claim 15% of Hasbro's total sales.

The main sore spot for Hasbro was its girls' business, which accounted for 16% of its revenue. Sales slipped 22% annually due to lower demand for My Little Pony, Furby, and Nerf Rebelle products. 
Meanwhile, Mattel is more exposed than Hasbro to girls' brands. Last quarter, sales of Barbie and its ""other girls"" brands respectively declined 11% and 6% annually on a constant currency basis. Together, those two categories accounted for over half of its top line. Mattel's sole bright spot had been its exclusive right to manufacture Disney's (NYSE:DIS) popular Frozen dolls. Unfortunately, Hasbro was also granted the right to sell Disney princess dolls, including the Frozen characters, starting in 2016. 
Therefore, if you're looking for a toymaker which can profit from upcoming Marvel, Star Wars, and Disney films, Hasbro fits the bill perfectly.
Electronic ArtsMoving on from toys, let's check in on Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), one of the largest game publishers in the world. Last quarter, EA's revenue rose 5.5% annually as net income improved 7.6%. By comparison, rival Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) revenue rose 15% annually as net income climbed 34.5% last quarter. Activision looks like a better growth play, but EA is a more stable investment for three key reasons -- digital strength, diversification, and mobile growth.
52% of EA's revenue came from higher-margin digital platforms last quarter, versus 44% a year earlier. By comparison, 45% of Activision's revenue came from digital sales last quarter. EA's gaming portfolio is well-diversified across multiple genres, including sports games, shooters like Battlefield Hardline, RPGs like Dragon Age: Inquisition, licensed Star Wars games, and mobile titles. By comparison, Activision still relies heavily on three aging franchises -- World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Skylanders.

Looking ahead, EA's most eagerly anticipated game is Star Wars: Battlefront, an online role playing game which will launch in November to coincide with the Disney's release of Star Wars: Episode VII in December. If Battlefront is a hit, it could lure users away from other online RPGs like World of Warcraft.
On mobile devices, EA's revenue rose 18% annually to $136 million as monthly active users hit 165 million, thanks to the strong performance of games like Simpsons: Tapped Out. Activision's mobile revenues, which came from games like Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, only rose 4% annually to $86 million last quarter. This puts EA in a better position to capitalize on rising sales of mobile games, which could double from $17.5 billion in 2013 to $35.4 billion in 2017, according to research firms AppLift and Newzoo.
The verdictLeisure stocks like Hasbro and EA are ""sunny day stocks"" which will do well as long as consumer confidence remains high. However, that exuberance is also pushing both stocks to premium valuations -- Hasbro and EA now respectively trade at 26 and 28 times trailing earnings, compared to the S&P 500's P/E of 21. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on both stocks, but they should also realize that neither one is fundamentally cheap.

            ","Interest in 2015's E3 conference was massive. Streaming service Twitch said that the show attracted 21 million viewers to its site last month, up from 12 million in 2014. And the conference set records on social media as well, with 6 million Twitter posts and 8 million Instagram likes according to the Entertainment Software Association.
Taking E3's popularity as a proxy for video game demand gives us one more reason to believe publishers are in for a huge 2015. Here are a couple more: The release lineup is stacked, next-gen console installed bases are huge, and digital sales are boosting profit margins to the stratosphere. It's no wonder Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) stocks are both sitting at all-time highs. But which one is the better bet for investors right now?
Electronic Arts EA has momentum on its side. Its profitability leapt past 71% of sales this year, up from 63% in 2012. Operating cash flow has more than quadrupled since 2012 to $1 billion a year. 
But management thinks that's just the start. ""The digital transformation sweeping the whole industry is still in its infancy,"" Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen recently told investors. This tectonic shift provides a chance to ""grow margins by increasing the proportion of full game downloads, by providing extra content for games, and by taking our IP to mobile platforms,"" he predicted.

EA's upcoming release calendar is strong, and it starts with new entries in the blockbuster Madden, NHL, and FIFA franchises. But most of the excitement -- for gamers and investors -- centers around the Star Wars: Battlefront game set for release in November. This shooter attracted huge interest at E3, where executives stressed the game's fidelity to the epic Star Wars franchise. ""You can fly X-wings, TIE fighters, and the Millennium Falcon,"" producer Sigurlina Ingvarsdottir told the crowd. Battlefront could sell as many as 14 million copies, launching a bona fide new AAA franchise for EA in the process. 
Activision BlizzardIn contrast, Activision Blizzard is coming off a year in which two of its biggest brands, World of Warcraft and Call of Duty, registered sales declines. Yet the publisher made huge strides in diversifying its portfolio. With help from the likes of Hearthstone and Destiny, it now counts 10 leading franchises in its quiver, up from 5 last year.
And it's not as if Activision's business is struggling. Call of Duty's Advanced Warfare was yet again the top-selling video game of the year as Skylanders kicked in massive software and toy profits. The company booked record earnings last year as digital revenue pushed past 50% of sales.
The next year is all about expanding into new genres, business model, and markets for this publisher. Call of Duty Online is ramping up in China, while Guitar Hero will join Hearthstone to attack the massive market for casual gameplay on smartphones and tablets.

The most anticipated game in the lineup is of course Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. That title adds several innovations aimed at keeping the franchise fresh and on top of the sales charts as it enters its twelfth year. There's the zombie mode, for example, that promises to boost engagement and digital sales. 
ValuationThe two stock valuations have switched places lately, with EA's jumping to over 5 times sales from a low of 1 times sales just three years ago. In contrast, investors can snap up Activision for 4 times trailing revenue, a slight discount to last year's price.

Wall Street seems to be betting on a home run for EA with Star Wars. And the title's strong reception at E3, along with hefty preorder sales, suggests that's likely. But investors who prefer to own a more diversified software lineup at a cheaper price should consider Activision Blizzard.

It will be another four months before Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) releases its ""Star Wars: Battlefront"" game. But video game fans are already committing to the title in droves. The deluxe edition ranks No. 15 on Amazon's best-selling games list, ahead of currently available hits such as Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) ""Advanced Warfare"" or Ubisoft's ""Watch Dogs. Battlefront"" retails for a steep $70, which also happens to be the price of EA's shares at the moment.
But investors might want to buy the stock instead of the game if they have to pick only one. That purchase could earn them a tidy 14% profit.
The upgrade Despite a 100% rise over the last year, EA just won a new fan on Wall Street. UBS analyst Eric Sheridan upgraded the stock to ""buy"" this week while boosting his price target from $65 to $80. Sheridan's optimism centers around the ""Battlefront"" game, which he thinks will sell as many as 14 million copies, or 40% above management's forecast. 
After all, the title just cleaned up at this year's E3 conference, collecting hefty awards, including ""Best Action Game"" and ""Best Online Multiplayer."" Preorder sales through Amazon seem strong, and they'll likely receive heavy promotion by retailer GameStop this summer and fall.
And if ""Battlefront"" does meet strong gamer demand, investors can expect substantial profit growth to follow. That's mostly thanks to the positive role that digital sales are playing in EA's business right now. The channel has spiked to $2.2 billion annually, up from $1.7 billion just two years ago. The biggest piece of that growth is from consoles, where EA can market add-on content and full game downloads.
Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen recently explained to investors how that revenue supercharges EA's results:
The [add-on content] part of our business is growing dramatically. It not only extends the life of the game, but it also allows us to gain additional revenue on that life over time. And we find that what that also does is allows us to lower the cost of marketing to the next customer, because you're not paying a lot to reacquire someone; the customer is already playing.
Digital sales are the driving factor behind EA's huge profitability improvement. Gross profit is up to almost 70% of sales, pushing it past rival Activision Blizzard.

EA Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.
The payoff Those improving economics are why Sheridan thinks EA can book $3.01 per share in profit this year. That estimate is significantly higher than Wall Street's collective judgment: The 21 analysts who cover the stock see earnings coming in at $2.85 per share. EA's management, meanwhile, is targeting just $2.75 per share for the year.

Still, UBS's stock price target seems reasonable. If the stock rose to $80 per share, it would be valued at 27 times that $3 profit figure. The current P/E valuation is 26 times, so we're not talking about a huge move. 
It's never a good idea to bet on one title changing the fortunes of a video game publisher. After all, Take-Two recently managed the single biggest sales result ever for an entertainment property launch with ""GTA V,"" yet the stock underperformed both EA and Activision. 
Also, it's possible that ""Battlefront"" will stumble out of the gate, especially given all the build-up. A lot depends on how the game works once it gets into players' hands. EA had to eat crow for some recent glitchy releases, including ""severely fumbling"" the launch of ""SimCity"" in 2013. That kind of slip-up could always happen again.
Still, I think the upcoming ""Battlefield"" launch is a great extra reason to like EA's business in addition to, say, the 9 percentage point gross profit margin improvement since 2012. For my money, though, I still like Activision Blizzard as the better video game stock value at the moment.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) made a number of notable announcements at E3 this year. The video game giant unveiled several new titles and showed off many of its upcoming releases. Below are three key takeaways from its press conference.
New games are comingAs a video game publisher, Electronic Arts' financial results depend entirely on its ability to release compelling new titles. The company spent most of E3 detailing its upcoming pipeline, the majority of which are slated to debut this year or in 2016.
Unsurprisingly, its sports franchises (FIFA, Madden, NBA Live, and NHL) will receive their regular annual installments this year with updated graphics and improved features. The company also plans to release an expansion pack to its massive multiplayer online game, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and a new entry in its racing series, Need for Speed. 
For 2016, Electronic Arts is scheduled to release a sequel to Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare, an online, team-based third-person shooter with a cartoon aesthetic. It will also release the fourth entry in its long-running sci-fi RPG series Mass Effect, along with a sequel to the 2008 action game Mirror's Edge. The company also plans to publish puzzle platformer, Unravel, what appears to be low-budget title, one unlikely to have much of an effect on earnings. However, it is a noticeable departure from Electronic Arts' traditional offerings.

Star Wars: Battlefront looks impressiveThe most important game in this lineup might be Star Wars: Battlefront. The Star Wars-themed first-person shooter is due to launch on Nov. 17th, just weeks before the release of the next feature film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Of all the upcoming titles, this seems most likely to provide a significant boost to the bottom line.
Electronic Arts announced the game several months ago but used E3 to show actual gameplay footage for the first time. Reviews for the game will not show up until just before its launch, but if the E3 presentation was any indication, the game looks spectacular.

Electronic Arts has said its current guidance is based on sales projections of nine million to 10 million copies. That estimate is based on previous Battlefront games (the last of which was released a decade ago) and Electronic Arts' long-running Battlefield series of first-person shooters. Battlefront is being developed by the same studio that produced Battlefield, and the similarities should be obvious to anyone who has played those games. Given the growing mania surrounding the reemergence of Star Wars (the first teaser trailer for Episode 7 has been viewed more than 69 million times on YouTube) management guidance could prove conservative.
Wading into the collectible card game genreElectronic Arts derives the majority of its sales from traditional gaming platforms -- consoles and  PCs -- but mobile gaming is growing rapidly, and Electronic Arts is an active participant. Last quarter, mobile brought in about 13% of adjusted net revenue. In time, it could be much more: Research firm eMarketer expects the market for mobile games in the U.S. to rise 16.5% in 2015.
The company did not spend much time discussing its mobile initiatives but did announce one new title -- Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, a collectible card game.
Without too many specifics, it is difficult to judge just how big Galaxy of Heroes could be. But it seems remarkably similar to Hearthstone, a collectible card game rival Activison Blizzard launched on mobile devices last year. Hearthstone has been something of a surprise success for Activision. As of May, Hearthstone, along with newcomer Destiny, had generated a combined $1 billion in adjusted revenue.
Gamers might not take to Galaxy of Heroes with the same enthusiasm, but if they do, it could become an unexpected source of upside in the quarters to come.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) continues its impressive run.
Shares of the video game publisher rose on Tuesday, after the company turned in a fiscal fourth quarter earnings report that greatly exceeded expectations. Electronic Arts' business appears to be firing on all cylinders, as demand for its games continues to surge in the face of strong next-generation console adoption.
During its subsequent earnings call, Electronic Arts' management, including CEO Andrew Wilson and CFO Blake Jorgensen, offered a number of key insights into the company's business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that call.
On Electronic Arts' upcoming slate of gamesAs a major video game publisher, Electronic Arts' business is entirely beholden to the popularity of its games. A major title can generate the bulk of its performance in a key quarter, while a disappointment could lead to an earnings miss. Early in the call, Wilson offered investors a quick rundown of Electronic Arts' plans for new games in the coming fiscal year.
In addition to Star Wars: Battlefront ... the latest releases of Rory McIlroy: PGA Tour, Madden NFL, FIFA, NHL, and NBA Live ... FY 2016 will see the return of Need for Speed as we introduce a new console experience as well as a new mobile game. Maxis will continue to deliver great new content for The Sims 4, including another expansion pack, multiple game packs, and additional game updates for the growing Sims 4 player community ... we will be returning to the Plants vs. Zombies universe with a bigger and bolder new console experience ... Minions Paradise ... will be one of at least five new EA Mobile titles this year. In spring 2016, Mirror's Edge is set to revolutionize the action-adventure genre with its stunning first-person gameplay.
Margins are improvingAs a business, Electronic Arts' underlying performance is improving. Two years ago, Electronic Arts' management made a commitment to double adjusted operating margins to 20%, but managed to surpass that guidance a year ahead of schedule. During the call, Jorgensen noted and explained Electronic Arts' rapid improvement.
When we first started talking about improving the performance of Electronic Arts, I suggested it would take three years to double our non-GAAP operating margins from 10% to 20%. We've exceeded that in two years. In fact, at nearly 25%, our fiscal 2015 operating margin is over 500 basis points above our guidance at the beginning of the year and at its highest point in over a decade. We've dramatically increased our efficiency. Non-GAAP operating expenses are down a full 10 percentage points, from 56% of net revenue in FY 2013 to just 46% in FY 2015.
The digital shift continuesElectronic Arts has been a vocal proponent of the ongoing shift toward digital distribution. While physical game discs still compose the bulk of games Electronic Arts sells on major consoles, it may not be that way for much longer. During the call, COO Peter Moore noted the trends Electronic Arts is seeing in its business.
Our full-game downloads that you're seeing, they do vary from title and by geography. But the latest data we've got shows us at a 20%+ for Battlefield Hardline, and that's up from about 13% to 15% this time last year for our AAA title releases. So we're seeing the growth.
Expectations for Star WarsAlthough Electronic Arts has many games scheduled for its upcoming fiscal year, in terms of importance, one title in particular is likely to stand above the rest. Star Wars: Battlefront, its upcoming first-person shooter, is scheduled to debut in November, just a month before the release of the next Star Wars film. During the call, Jorgensen gave Electronic Arts' expectations for the games, likening it to past Battlefront games and Electronic Arts' other first-person shooters.
We're thinking about [Battlefront] with two bookends. One bookend is the historical Battlefront, which did roughly 9 million units. The other bookend is our core first-person shooter franchise of Battlefield, which typically does around 15 million units. So I think in our guidance, we've roughly put in there roughly 9 million to 10 million units for the title, with we believe some upside obviously if things goes well. It is [Xbox One and PlayStation 4]-only and PC, and so that needs to get factored into people's thinking, but it is a very exciting title.
A possible delay?Electronic Arts has delayed several of its key games in recent months, including most recently, Battlefield: Hardline. The delays don't seem to have had much of an effect on Electronic Arts' performance, as the extra development time may have ensured a better product. But that likely won't be true for Star Wars: Battlefront. A key element to the game's success could be its timing in relation to the debut of Star Wars in theaters. If Battlefront is delayed -- perhaps pushed out to January or February of 2016 -- some of the buzz could die down, and sales could disappoint. During the call, Wilson touched on this topic, noting that anything is possible, but the company is currently very committed to launching Battlefront in November.
With that said, there are any number of things that might contribute to a miss or a need to move a date. As it relates to Star Wars: Battlefront, I would say as it stands right now, we feel very, very good about the trajectory and the velocity of the development team.

            ","Back in 2012, it was estimated that the U.S. video game industry grew four times faster than the U.S. economy from 2009 through 2012 by the Entertainment Software Association. Looking ahead, research firm DFC Intelligence estimates that worldwide game sales will soar from $63 billion in 2014 to $100 billion by 2018.

However, the video game industry can be tough for new investors to understand. Many gaming companies are overly dependent on blockbuster franchises. Accelerated release schedules cause studios to launch games before they're ready, resulting in franchise-killing flops. In-app purchases and downloadable content can turn some games into ""pay-to-win"" affairs. 
Therefore, let's take a look at two types of video game companies -- reliable core holdings and volatile mobile plays -- to see which types of gaming companies suit your investing style.
Core stocks: EA and Activision BlizzardGame publishing giants Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) are solid core holdings for any video game centered portfolio.
Electronic Arts had a rough run over the past few years. The Consumerist named EA the worst company in America in 2012 and 2013, following botched, bug-ridden launches of flagship games like SimCity and Battlefield 4. 

Battlefield 4 represented a low point in EA's history. Source: EA.
Under new CEO Andrew Wilson, who replaced John Riccitiello in 2013, EA delayed titles rather than rush them into a holiday release (such as Battlefield Hardline) and streamlined its mobile business. As a result, EA's non-GAAP revenue improved 6% annually in 2014 as net income more than doubled. Mobile revenue hit $460 million in 2014, up from $104 million in 2013, thanks to the success of its mobile sports games and tie-in games with console titles.
Activision Blizzard's top line is highly dependent on aging franchises like Call of Duty, Skylanders, and World of Warcraft. As a result, Activision's stock price is often weighed down by weakening Call of Duty sales or slumping World of Warcraft subscriber numbers. However, Activision has steadily diversified its top line with new IPs like Destiny. In 2014, Activision's non-GAAP revenues rose 11% as earnings rose higher than 50%. However, revenue at Activision's mobile unit, which accounted for 12% of its top line, fell 29% year-over-year as its mobile games failed to impress.
On a fundamental basis, Activision stock is cheaper at 20 times earnings, compared to EA's P/E of 22. However, EA stock also rallied 103% over the past 12 months, compared to Activision's 16% gain.
Speculative stocks: Zynga, King, and Glu MobileMobile gaming stocks are more speculative investments than heavyweight publishers like EA and Activision. Let's take a look at three such stocks: Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), King Digital Entertainment (NYSE:KING), and Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:GLUU).
Zynga's two top games are Farmville 2 and Zynga Poker, which together generated 43% of its revenue last quarter. 40% of Glu's revenue came from its chart-topping hit, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood last quarter. King's top franchise is Candy Crush Saga, which accounted for 45% of the company's ""gross bookings"" last quarter. 
Both Zynga and King often refer to gross bookings, or total purchases of virtual products (like energy packs), instead of revenue. Those purchases are initially reported as deferred revenue and recognized as bookings over the estimated time that it takes to ""consume"" the virtual product.

King's Candy Crush Saga could give your portfolio cavities.
There are a few notable problems with this business model. First, any slowdown in top grossing games will cause their stocks to slide. The companies must then develop and market new games to offset those losses, but doing so can cause operating expenses to spike. 
Most mobile game makers generate revenue from a ""freemium"" model. However, 60% of those revenues across the industry come from just 0.23% of all players, according to mobile marketing firm Swrve. This means that all three companies rely heavily on so-called ""whales"" to keep buying virtual goods as the majority of gamers play for free. As we can see from Zynga, King, and Glu's top and bottom line numbers for 2014, that top-heavy business model yields mixed results.

Do your due diligence, dear investor ...We've merely covered the basics of investing in video games in this article, but investors should first understand the difference between time-tested gaming stocks like EA and Activision and speculative plays like King. Moreover, investors should do their due diligence and understand the weight of various franchises on these companies' top lines, and which upcoming games will serve as catalysts for the stock.

Investors looking to get exposure to this industry have a variety of options, but Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) are three of the best companies in the space.
Electronic Arts was one of the single best performing tech stocks in 2014. Shares of the publisher more than doubled, as sales of several of its key titles, including Titanfall and Dragon Age: Inquisition, exceeded expectations. That surge has given Electronic Arts a more aggressive valuation than some of its rivals, but the stock could continue to deliver in the quarters to come. 
Among video game publishers, Electronic Arts has what may be the most interesting game for 2015. In November the company will launch Star Wars: Battlefront, a multiplayer first person shooter set in the fictional Star Wars universe. On its own, the game already had the potential to be a top-selling title, but it could be catapulted up the rankings by the fervor surrounding the upcoming film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which will arrive in theaters roughly one month after Battlefront hits store shelves. Electronic Arts released a trailer for the game on Friday, and it looks -- to put it mildly -- stunning.

In addition, Electronic Arts also has its sports franchises (including Madden and FIFA), which continue to be consistent winners. Electronic Arts depends mostly on traditional consoles, but versions of its sports games designed for smartphones and tablets have helped propel its mobile revenue, which rose 26% year-over-year last quarter.
Activision Blizzard has fewer franchises than Electronic Arts, but the titles it does release are almost always massively successful. Activision has several billion-dollar franchises and household names under its belt, including World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Skylanders.
The latter two will receive new entries later this year, along with a new title in the Guitar Hero series. Destiny -- which is developed by Bungie but published by Activision -- will be supported with a series of digital expansions. Destiny was something of a drain on Activison shares last fall after reviewers panned the title, but it ultimately went on to become the best-selling game in a new series ever.
Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, has been expanding to new platforms in recent months. Last week, it arrived on Android and the iPhone for the first time. Hearthstone is a free-to-play mobile game, but it is aimed more at gaming enthusiasts than casual players. Since its release last year, Activision has continued to support the game with a series of expansions, and its revenue has grown from month to month. When Activision last reported earnings, it noted that Hearthstone set a record for monthly revenue in December.
Longer-term, Activision has two new titles planned, Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm, and could reap long-term financial rewards from Call of Duty: Online, a free-to-play version of its massively popular shooter currently exclusive to China.
Take-Two is a much smaller company than both Electronic Arts and Activision, but it has one of the largest franchises in gaming: Grand Theft Auto. The latest installment, Grand Theft Auto V, originally released in 2013, has become one of the best selling games in history, moving more than 45 million units as of the end of last quarter.
Unlike its competitors, Take-Two has been reluctant to turn Grand Theft Auto into an annual series, instead releasing a new entry every four to five years. But in the meantime, Take-Two has been able to monetize Grand Theft Auto through Grand Theft Auto Online, a separate, online version of the game that includes the ability to purchase in-game currency with real money.
Of course, Take-Two is more than just Grand Theft Auto. It has two sports series -- NBA2K and WWE -- that should receive entries this year. In addition, Red Dead Redemption, a game Take-Two released in 2010 to both great critical and commercial success, could be about to get a sequel. It is not confirmed, but the company has been hinting at its development.

            ","When it comes to your Roth IRA, a good strategy is to aim for holdings that will grow briskly. That's because the money earned in a Roth IRA can be withdrawn tax-free. Thus, it's smart to park at least some stocks in your Roth IRA that have the potential to be big long-term winners.
Here are three compelling candidates:
Image: Electronic Arts.
Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA)Electronic Arts is a powerhouse in the booming and profitable world of video games. It struggled in recent years, but CEO Andrew Wilson has been turning things around in a big way, with the stock more than doubling over the past year. And with its recent and forward-looking P/E ratios only in the low 20s, it's still not grossly overvalued.
Electronic Arts is generating about a billion dollars annually in free cash flow. Gross margins have been rising over the past few years, and net margins recently approached a hefty 20%. Part of the reason for the margin growth is a big push into subscription-based gaming, via its EA Access program, giving subscribers access to older titles. The industrywide move toward digital downloads of games is also boosting profits, as games no longer have to be printed, packaged, and stocked on shelves.
Other catalysts for the business include the relatively new Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles, which will boost demand for new games, and the company's push into mobile gaming, which is projected to generate $21 billion industrywide this year, with digital gamers spending a third of their dollars on mobile games. Mobile games are expected by some to hit $60 billion by 2017. Another promising catalyst is the upcoming Star Wars: Battlefront game, which will make its debut late in the year, along with the latest Star Wars movie.
Meanwhile, the company still has its strong franchises of Madden NFL, Battlefield, and FIFA -- and mobile successes with SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile, and FIFA Ultimate Team. For its third quarter, the company posted revenue up 39% year over year, and more than 160 million monthly active users for its mobile games. The company certainly seems to have more room to run.
Image: Priceline Group.
Priceline Group Inc. (NASDAQ:PCLN)Priceline Group Inc was once known for its name-your-own-price airfare deals, but it's grown into an online travel juggernaut, having gobbled up Booking.com, Kayak.com, and OpenTable, among other successful businesses. It now offers discounted booking for airfares, hotels, car rentals, and vacation packages -- and now bookings for restaurants, too. Another recent acquisition is Rocketmiles, which will give Priceline an appealing loyalty program, via the ability to offer airline miles as rewards with bookings, boosting its appeal and competitiveness.
Past performance doesn't guarantee future success, but based on past performance, Priceline seems poised to continue growing significantly in a Roth IRA. Over the past decade, its revenue and earnings, respectively, have averaged annual gains of 25% and 54%. Its gross margins have soared from about 28% to 90% over that span, while net margins have popped from 20% to nearly 29%. In its fourth quarter, gross bookings rose 17% year over year, with earnings per share rising 20%. International bookings grew by 27%, which bodes well for the company's prospects, as much of its growth potential lies abroad. It's also an impressive number considering recent weakness in Europe and China.
Priceline stock seems appealingly priced, too. It has averaged annual growth of 46.5% over the past decade, but is down a smidge over the past year. Its P/E ratio was recently only 26 for such a fast grower, and its forward-looking P/E just 16, well below its five-year average of 30. Management has deemed its stock price attractive enough to get a $3 billion stock buyback program approved, with which to reward shareholders. Priceline might be even more profitable today if it weren't plowing a lot of money into advertising and into its businesses such as OpenTable and BookingsSuite. But such investments today can pay off powerfully tomorrow.
Facebook stock has been on a bit of a tear since it debuted.
Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB)We all know that Facebook is a big growth story. Its revenue and earnings per share, respectively, have averaged annual gains of 50% and 37% over the past three years, while its stock has soared. Yet with a forward-looking P/E ratio near 33, the stock doesn't seem too pricey at recent levels.
To understand the company's great growth potential, you just have to review a few numbers. As of the end of 2014, it had 890 million active daily users -- nearly a billion people -- a level up 18% over the year before. Its mobile active daily users numbered nearly as much, 745 million, up 34% from the year before. Even more intriguing, more than 80% of its active daily users are outside the U.S. and Canada.
Once you appreciate its great reach, think about what Facebook knows about most of us users, and what it can do with that information. It's already making a lot of money from ads on its site -- remember, its service remains free for its billion-some users -- and it's moving into video ads. It can use its data gathered on users to target ads so that they're more likely to be effective. Facebook's advertising revenue soared 65% in 2014, to $11.5 billion, its number of active monthly advertisers hit a whopping 2 million, and it grabbed market share from titan Google. It's impressively effective in advertising, too, managing to significantly reduce its number of ads in 2014's fourth quarter while boosting their average price more than fourfold. Meanwhile, Facebook is even threatening eBay's PayPal unit, adding a payment feature to its Messenger App.
Facebook can also leverage its broad base in others ways, such as by trying to enter the professional networking arena. And with annual free cash flow topping $3.6 billion, it has the ability to buy plenty of promising technologies. It has bought Oculus VR, for example, which offers virtual-reality technology, and the popular WhatsApp app as well. Most recently, Facebook bought TheFind, a personalized e-commerce search service that can strengthen its ability to offer targeted advertising to its users. The company has been a savvy acquirer -- think of Instagram, bought for $1 billion a few years ago and recently worth $35 billion, with some 300 million monthly active users.
Whether you buy these or other companies for your Roth IRA, look for strong and healthy growers, as any exponential growth that occurs in your portfolio will be available to you tax-free in retirement.

            ","People are spending a lot of time playing video games these days. And I do mean a lot. 
Electronic Arts(NASDAQ:EA)saw gameplay hours for Madden NFL 15 jump 30% last quarter as compared to the prior year. And gamers spent an average of three hours per day playing Destiny in the first few months after launch, according to publisher Activision Blizzard(NASDAQ:ATVI).
Those banner engagement figures powered a massive profit spike at both gaming companies. EA managed an all-time high 68% profit margin last quarter, while Activision posted 51% higher earnings -- a record $1.42 per share. But whereas EA shares surged by over 100% in the past year, Activision stock has hardly budged.
So, does that make the owner of the Call of Duty and Skylanders franchises the obvious investment choice from here? Let's compare the two biggest publishers in the video game industry, starting with a few key statistics:
Revenue and sales growth are based on the last complete fiscal year. Profit margin is trailing 12 months. Source: Company filings
Broadly speaking, Activision looks like the cheaper investment. You can buy it at a discount to EA whether you are considering price-to-earnings or price-to-sales multiples. In fact, Activision has EA beat on all of the major metrics except one: profitability.
Electronic Arts is winning the digital warProfitability has been the main driver behind the amazing gains EA shares have enjoyed the past year. Gross profit margin is up from 58% of sales in 2011 to a projected 71% this year. The company even beat its larger rival on this key metric last quarter.

EA Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.
EA managed that feat through a few big wins, including its best yet Dragon Age game launch and solid improvements in the FIFA, Madden, and Sims franchises. But the biggest reason for the profit bounce has been its success with downloadable content sales. 
Digital revenue accounted for a record 49% of sales last quarter, up 35% from the prior year. And on a trailing 12 month basis, those highly profitable digital sales now represent more than half of EA revenue. The trend promises to keep lifting earnings higher in the next few years.
Source: Bungie
Activision Blizzard expands its portfolioActivision is also benefiting from that digital shift: The channel was responsible for 46% of sales in the past year, up 50% from 2013. That is particularly impressive when you consider how much revenue Activision gets from retail toy sales tied to its Skylanders kids franchise. 
But the best reason to like Activision Blizzard right now is its growing portfolio of AAA game brands. At the beginning of 2014, just three franchises, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Sklyanders, accounted for the vast majority of sales and profit. 
But with Destiny and Hearthstone added to the mix last year, and with Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, and Call of Duty Online slated for 2015, the portfolio will be packed with 10 blockbuster franchises by the end of this year.  
Foolish wrapWhile both businesses are performing well, I believe Activision Blizzard is the better investment. Yes, EA profitability should march higher, particularly as it rings the register on the recent Battlefield: Hardline release. However, those profit gains seem to be reflected in a stock that is now valued at 23 times trailing earnings, up from 17 times just three months ago.
The valuation gap alone suggests that Activision will outperform its smaller publishing rival over the next five years. Investors now have two great choices if they want diverse exposure to the surging video game market. But they can get that exposure at a comparative steal through Activision.

            ","It took George Lucas nearly thirty years to release six Star Wars films -- Disney could accomplish that feat in less than a decade.
Beginning this December with The Force Awakens, theater-goers are about to be inundated with a wave of Star Wars films -- not just mainline entries, but also side stories and spin-offs. Assuming they're as popular as the Star Wars movies that captivated audiences in years past, they should propel the shares of a wide variety of businesses beyond Disney (NYSE:DIS) itself.
Below are three less obvious stocks that could get a boost from Star Wars' return.
AMC should benefit from strong attendanceWith 348 locations and nearly 5,000 screens, AMC Holdings (NYSE:AMC) is one of the top movie theater chains in the United States. Its business is entirely dependent on the American public's interest in films -- and Star Wars should provide a nice jolt.
AMC has suffered from declining attendance figures in recent quarters -- an industrywide trend. To some extent, this may be to due to shifts in the broader competitive landscape: more appealing entertainment options and Internet streaming services have taken some of the allure out of theater attendance. But in its most recent earnings call, AMC blamed a weak film slate for its ticket sales, noting that it was the mercy of Hollywood to provide it with interesting films.
Star Wars should provide those films, drawing crowds of patrons to AMC's theaters in the years ahead. There are other publicly traded movie theater chains, but AMC may be the best bet, as its management has been able to persevere and even outperform the industry. Last quarter, AMC's admissions revenues per screen rose 13.8% -- much better than the 4.3% industrywide contraction.
Special effects best seen on an IMAX screenMany of those theater-goers could choose to see Star Wars on an IMAX (NYSE:IMAX) screen. If so, it should benefit that namesake company.
The high-end theater provider has been a frequent target of short-sellers in recent months: nearly one-fifth of its shares have been bet against. IMAX's business depends on the demand for its IMAX-branded screens, and with theater attendance in decline, the market for IMAX's systems could come under pressure.
IMAX has proven its critics wrong, rallying more than 20% over the last 12 months, but shares could rally further still as a wave of Star Wars films juices the demand for its systems. Star Wars films, perhaps more so than any other, depend on cutting-edge visuals and special effects, and watching them on an IMAX screen may offer a much better experience.
Electronic Arts' Star Wars-themed games should get more attentionVideo game giant Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) won't make any money from theater attendance -- at least not directly -- but consumers swept up in Star Wars mania could find themselves turning to Electronic Arts' upcoming slate of Star Wars-themed video games.
In 2013, Disney signed an exclusive pact with Electronic Arts to develop Star Wars games aimed at ""core audiences"" -- gamers that play on the Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. The first of these games, Star Wars: Battlefront, will debut later this year in conjunction with the release of The Force Awakens, and more should be forthcoming.
If the games are poorly made, they may not sell well, but the use of the Star Wars' intellectual property should at least attract the attention of gamers, many of whom are likely to be Star Wars fans.

            ","Gaming stocks have done very well over the past year. Third-party publishers have benefited from the introduction of new consoles from Sony and Microsoft as well as increasing digital sales, and these tailwinds helped every third-party console game publisher except for Ubisoft beat the market over the last 12 months. While Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive both posted solid gains, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) performed best of all, nearly doubling over the period.
The company's incredible stock gains have pushed its forward P/E ratio to roughly 28. Using this metric, EA stands as the priciest of the third-party games publishers. Yet, with a strong position in a growing industry and apparent improvement in the company's operations, Electronic Arts is also the most expensive stock worth buying in the realm of gaming companies.
Surveying the fieldElectronic Arts develops and publishes hit franchises like FIFA, Madden NFL, and Battlefield, and has ridden strong software performance to gains of roughly 93% over the last year. The company has also posted the best growth of any gaming company in the last five years, delivering gains of roughly 217% while the S&P 500 increased roughly 82%. Across the same stretch, Activision, Take Two, and Ubisoft made gains of 109%, 136%, and 46%, respectively. Surveying the competition: Activision Blizzard looks solid even as the Call of Duty series is losing some of its pull, Take Two seems to be building a stronger lineup on top of the megahit Grand Theft Auto series, while Ubisoft is looking a bit weak due to declining performance from its Assassin's Creed property.
EA is winning the digital distribution gameAlso key to Electronic Arts' growth is the advancement of its mobile presence and booming digital software sales. Selling games digitally rather than through retailers like GameStop is enabling the company to improve its margins and drive revenues through direct-to-consumer promotions. This has helped the company deliver results for its last four quarters that were significantly better than the average analyst estimate, and each earnings release prompted a significant stock bump. For the company's fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014, roughly 45% of the company's revenue came from digital sales. This impressive figure was partially propelled by a 47% year-over-year increase in the sale of downloadable content for games.
EA looks to have room to further improve its margins as digital distribution continues to make gains at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailers. The company's EA Access program functions as a year-long subscription to previously released games from some of its big series at a relatively low price of $30, and the company has indicated that the package has been quite successful. These types of direct-to-consumer promotions help the publisher to absorb revenue that might have otherwise been generated from used copies of its games.
Big franchises, mobile growth, and beyondElectronic Arts seems primed for more strong performance in the year to come, with new installments in some of the company's biggest franchises set to release, as well as the revival of the Star Wars: Battlefont series. The company should continue to benefit from the expanding user base for the new gaming consoles, as well as the ongoing growth in digital sales. It also has a major growth opportunity in mobile.
Research firm Digi-Capital estimates that mobile gaming will grow at a 23% compound aggregate growth rate, and hit $60 billion in sales by 2017, with the total gaming industry being worth $100 billion. Electronic Arts has a solid stable of franchises that it can use to ride this wave, a crucial asset because recognizable brands are often necessary to stand out in the crowded mobile software landscape. The company recently scored mobile hits with SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile, and FIFA Ultimate Team, and it looks like these properties are primed for continued gains.
With strong footing in console and mobile gaming, and great momentum in digital content distribution, EA is well-diversified across its industry. There has even been talk that the games publisher will team with Comcast to stream games through the cable-provider's X1 cable box. Even though Electronic Arts is priced for growth, there's plenty of evidence it can deliver. EA stands as the most expensive stock making games worth buying.

            ","Apple stock has been on an incredible run over the last year. Shares have increased roughly 67% in a 12-month span, with total returns coming in at a fantastic 70%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has gained roughly 12% over the period.
Apple stock currently trades near all-time highs, and the company has set a new record for highest market cap in history. But as great as the iPhone maker's performance has been, it isn't the only stock that's been crushing the market. We asked three Fool contributors to spotlight a company that has delivered even greater returns than Apple within the last year. Read on to learn about these massive market beaters.
Dan Caplinger (Skyworks Solutions): Apple has been a huge performer over the past year, but the company has grown so large that it's hard for even its massive results quarter after quarter to move the needle as much as smaller companies can experience. One great example of that phenomenon comes from Apple supplier Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), which has ridden the coattails of various tech giants to its own great success.
It's true that Skyworks owes some of its success to Apple. But the nearly 150% returns that the stock has posted in the past year aren't due entirely to the Cupertino-based tech giant. Indeed, one of the areas that Skyworks believes could help it grow the fastest involves the rising popularity of wireless communication generally. For high-end operations, Skyworks hopes to help support high-bandwidth uses like streaming video and music through its customized signal-filtering and tuning solutions. Meanwhile, other uses like navigation and power-management offer different but equally promising chances for Skyworks to broaden its business reach. With the rise of the Internet of Things, mobile payments, and on-demand entertainment, Skyworks doesn't have to labor entirely in Apple's shadow, and with plenty of runway left ahead, Skyworks could easily keep outpacing Apple's returns in 2015 and beyond.
Joe Tenebruso (Electronic Arts): Few large-cap companies have outperformed Apple over the last year. Yet surprisingly, what was once deemed ""The Worst Company in America"" has done just that.
After struggling for years with stagnating game franchises and a poor reputation among gamers, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) appears to have righted the ship. The long-beleaguered video game maker turned in an impressive 2014 and has risen more than 90% in the last 12 months, compared to Apple's nearly 70% returns.
Fueled by the launch of new game consoles like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, EA's trailing-12-month revenue surged 22% over the prior-year period. And thanks in part to a major shift toward higher-margin digital revenue -- which now comprises more than half of EA's total revenue-- adjusted earnings rose an even more impressive 51% during that time.
New CEO Andrew Wilson is taking steps to restore Electronics Arts' image among gamers by delivering high-quality new games such as the critically acclaimed Dragon Age: Inquisition, as well as popular new services such as EA Access, where gamers can subscribe to digital access to EA's older titles. These initiatives, along with consistently strong operational performance throughout 2014, have even led my Foolish colleague Sam Mattera to name Wilson the best tech CEO of 2014.
Keith Noonan (Ambarella): Growing demand for wearables and security cameras has propelled chipmaker Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) to incredible gains over the last year. The company is a small-cap stock with a market cap of around $2 billion, and its stock is prone to big swings, but shares have gained roughly 85% over the last 12 months and it looks like the company is poised to continue delivering wins for investors. Ambarella supplies image and video processing chips for devices such as GoPro cameras, and recently delivered great results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year. Sales for the annual term were up 38.5% over the prior year, and earnings per diluted share grew nearly 85%.
With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 40, Ambarella is priced for sustained growth and well above Apple's forward P/E of roughly 15, but the semiconductor company appears to be in shape to deliver. It anticipates that annual revenue will increase between 27% and 30% this year, along with improved operating margins, and there are reasons to believe the chipmaker's growth story is just getting started. Business is picking up in China and South Korea, and Ambarella is diversifying its customer base with wins in Xiaomi's upcoming low-cost action camera and the emerging drone market.
Security and automotive cameras also look poised for growth, and Ambarella's expertise in low-power, high-performance video chips will enable it to benefit from the rise of the Internet of Things. The stock could be a great pick for investors who are looking to capitalize on momentum in cameras but find individual camera makers like GoPro too risky.

            ","2014 was a solid year for the markets: the S&P 500 finished with an 11% gain. But a few tech stocks turned in even better performances. In particular, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) trounced the market, soaring in 2014.
Is it time to take profits in these tech stock winners? Or should investors in these stocks consider holding? Below, three Motley Fool contributors offer their takes on some of last year's best performers.
Bob Ciura (Facebook): Facebook continued to be a huge winner for investors last year. The stock gained more than 40% in 2014, which handily beat the broader market yet again. This continued a longer-term trend of strong outperformance since Facebook's initial public offering. Facebook's share price has doubled since its May 2012 IPO, as its key metrics -- revenue, active users, and profits -- have all racked up strong growth. Indeed, last year Facebook grew revenue and earnings per share by 58% and 83%, respectively, as monthly active users reached 1.39 billion.
But at some point, investors need to consider Facebook's valuation. The stock trades for 70 times 2014 GAAP diluted earnings, which is a significant concern. So far, investors seem too willing to brush aside Facebook's valuation, but that can be dangerous thinking. When discussing valuation as it pertains to social media stocks, some argue that valuation doesn't really matter for growth stocks. Instead, these companies will grow fast enough to justify their lofty valuations. And many times, that's absolutely true. However, there comes a point Facebook can't keep growing at accelerating rates.
Facebook is now a $214 billion company by market capitalization. This is an enormous company. Investors buying in at these levels are at risk of poor future returns, if and when Facebook's tantalizing growth finally begins to slow down. Even great companies can be bad investments in cases of overvaluation. Investors may want to take some of their Facebook profits off the table.
Tamara Walsh (Apple): The tech giant was a high flyer last year, with its stock gaining nearly 79% compared to just a 14% gain by the S&P 500 over the same period. Apple has enjoyed such a momentous run, in fact, that it is now worth more than the entire S&P 600 small-cap index. And with a market cap north of $755 billion today, Apple is not only the most valuable company in history, but it is also worth more than double any other publicly traded company on the market today.
Nevertheless, with shares of Apple currently trading near record highs at around $130 apiece, many investors worry there could be a correction on the horizon. For starters, there's a lot of pressure building around the tech titan's upcoming Apple Watch launch, which is set to hit the market in April. The company is planning a media event on March 9 that many speculate is related to the anticipated debut of its first truly wearable device. Yet, if Apple's upcoming iWatch isn't a hit with consumers it could bolster concerns that Apple is losing its innovative edge -- a reality that would likely crush the stock in its wake.
However, the stock's stratospheric surge and future execution risks are hardy reason enough to sell this tech stock superstar. Even if Apple's iWatch is a flop, the company has enough liquid assets and cash on hand to offset any related losses. Not to mention, Apple will continue to reward current shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Apple, for example, spent more than $56 billion last year on dividends and share repurchases, and analysts at Credit Suisse believe Apple will raise its capital return plan to $202 billion by 2017, according to the Financial Times.
Therefore, even at all time highs, Apple is one tech stock winner that investors should own for many more years to come.
Sam Mattera (Electronic Arts): Video game publisher Electronic Arts was one of the single best performing stocks in the market last year. Boosted by the launch of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, Electronic Arts shares doubled in 2014, and have continued to rally in 2015.
Electronic Arts isn't the bargain it was a year ago, but it may not be time to take profits just yet. The console cycle that benefited Electronic Arts remains in its infancy -- the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 have been on the market only a fraction as long as their predecessors. As more gamers adopt these platforms, Electronic Arts will gain more potential customers for its upcoming titles. Electronic Arts faces a lot of competition, but may be the most innovative major publisher. Last July, it launched EA Access, a first of its kind subscription service that allows it to monetize older content.
Led by its new CEO, Andrew Wilson, Electronic Arts is slowly turning around its poor image, and releasing higher quality games. Later this month, it will launch Battlefield: Hardline, and in December, it will benefit from the return of Star Wars with Star Wars: Battlefront.

            ","Star Wars: The Force Awakens will open in theaters on Dec 18.
Sometime around then -- perhaps a week or two before -- Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) will launch Star Wars: Battlefront, a first-person shooter video game set in the Star Wars universe. Battlefront is being developed by Electronic Arts' DICE studio, known primarily for its work on the popular Battlefield franchise.
Battlefield has long stood as the chief rival to Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) Call of Duty series. Despite facing tough competition from Electronic Arts over the years, Activision's titles have continued to generate billions in sales.
Yet, Star Wars: Battlefront represents a unique challenge, one that should not be discounted by shareholders.
Riding a wave of Star Wars hypeElectronic Arts' management has said it plans to promote Star Wars: Battlefront aggressively, leveraging the power of the Star Wars cultural phenomenon to drive sales.
By the time Episode 7 debuts in theaters, it will have been more than a decade since the release of a Star Wars film. Anticipation should be high -- Disney paid $4 billion for a reason -- and it could be contagious, particularly among avid video game players.
Star Wars has served as inspiration for dozens of video games over the years, and many of them have proven to be quite popular. Star Wars: Battlefront is itself a reboot of a game originally released in 2004, one that sold roughly 3 million copies and earned a sequel.
If nothing else, the latest incarnation of Battlefront should benefit from a general interest in Star Wars sparked by the release of the film. It's also quite likely, however, that the game will be well-received: As a studio, DICE has a strong track record, with several critically acclaimed games under its belt, including Mirror's Edge and Battlefield 4.
Call of Duty may be facing franchise fatigueIt's entirely possible that gamers could purchase both, but Activision's next Call of Duty could lose some sales to Battlefront. Released around the same time, and in the same genre, the games are likely to compete for the same sort of gamers.
Already, Call of Duty is showing some signs of franchise fatigue. The latest installment -- Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare -- was 2014's single-best selling game, but demand for the series appears to have peaked. Yet, Activision has a plan to reinvigorate the series: Treyarch.  
Although all Call of Duty installments bear a similarity, Activision uses three different studios to create the series. Treyarch is making 2015's installment, which could result in a quality entry. Treyarch's past Call of Duty games -- particularly Black Ops and Black Ops II -- have been among the game's best received. The studio should additionally benefit from a three-year development cycle -- only the second Call of Duty game to do so.
Activision has other games to fall back onBut even if Treyarch's magic can't propel Call of Duty in 2015, Activision has other games to fall back on. World of Warcraft and Skylanders remain reliable cash cows, while Hearthstone and Destiny provide potential upside.
As an Activision shareholder with a long-term perspective, Star Wars: Battlefront doesn't frighten me enough to sell. That said, Activision investors should be aware of the threat, and perhaps be willing to ride out a bumpy winter if Battlefront, does, indeed, steal Call of Duty sales.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) shares have been on fire as of late: Shares of the video game publisher are up more than 130% in the last year alone. That gain comes on a series of strong earnings reports. Most recently, Electronic Arts exceeded analyst expectations for the third quarter, posting better-than-expected revenue and earnings.
In its subsequent earnings call, Electronic Arts management touched on a number of positive trends that are supporting its business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that call.
Electronic Arts is seeing strong demand for nearly all of its gamesAs a publisher of video games, Electronic Arts' performance depends entirely on the success of its titles. Within the industry, Electronic Arts is well-diversified, with franchises in most genres, and games on most platforms, including mobile.
On the call, its CEO Andrew Wilson noted that the business appears to be strong on all fronts, with demand for its titles up across the board.
""Dragon Age: Inquisition was named to more than 200 Game of the Year lists ... More than 6 million people on average were playing FIFA games every week ... Madden NFL Mobile had its biggest day in franchise history on Christmas Day, reaching number four on the top grossing charts in the U.S. Apple App Store. And we finished the calendar year as the world's leading console ... publisher.""
The Ultimate Team initiative is paying offElectronic Arts' sports franchises (Madden, FIFA, NHL, UFC etc) benefit from yearly refreshes, but have suffered from a degree of cyclicality in the past, with interest waning in between annual releases.
But Electronic Arts has found a way to drive engagement year-round: Ultimate Team. Pioneered with its FIFA franchise, Ultimate Team has come to the majority of Electronic Arts sports titles, including Madden. With Ultimate Team, players build fantasy squads of elite players. Ultimate Team gives players a reason to play their favorite Electronic Arts sports title months after release, and benefits Electronic Arts through additional digital revenue. Wilson noted that engagement in Ultimate Team continues to be on the rise.
""Ultimate Team ... engagement is deeper than ever. The total number of players entering Ultimate Team across FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15 and NHL 15 has increased nearly 45% year-over-year.""
Electronic Arts should benefit from Episode 7Electronic Arts will release the next installment in its popular Battlefield franchise in March, but its 2015 marquee title is likely to be Star Wars: Battlefront.
Unfortunately, Electronic Arts hasn't given an exact release date for the game, but it's likely to debut sometime in November or December. Electronic Arts' management believes the game will be a blockbuster, as it should benefit from the release of Star Wars: Episode 7 (slated to open in theaters Dec. 18).
""We've got a ... Star Wars title coming in before Christmas next year, aligned with the Star Wars movie ... We're extremely excited about that and we think there is huge potential for that title ... you should consider that a very large activity for us next year and very large focus, similar to how we thought about Battlefield [games] in the past.""
Be wary of NPD dataResearch firm NPD tracks monthly U.S. video game sales, and its data is commonly seen as a strong indicator of the overall strength of the industry. Recent NPD data has been weak, with demand for video games seemingly declining on an annual basis for most of the last year.
However, Electronic Arts' CFO, Blake Jorgensen, warned investors to be cautious when considering NPD's data, as the firm does not track digital or international sales. With a growing number of Electronic Arts' games sold digitally, NPD is becoming increasingly irrelevant.
""Be really careful using NPD data, it's becoming less and less valuable, as more and more of the business is going digital ... both in volume and in pricing, it can be sometimes a very large distraction. And then when you add in that there is no international piece to it -- it really underestimates the strength of our business.""
More capital returns could be forthcomingElectronic Arts has nearly $3 billion of cash on its balance sheet, as of the end of last quarter. The company doesn't pay a dividend, but has been willing to return cash to shareholders via share repurchases.
When prompted, Jorgensen reiterated Electronic Arts' commitment to return cash to shareholders whenever possible.
""We're very committed to continuing to buyback stock. We are on track to be able to complete the $750 million two-year buyback, and as we generate more cash we'll consider greater buybacks ... I think we just have a simple model, which is saying how do we get [the cash] back to shareholders.""

            ","In December, I named Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) CEO Andrew Wilson the greatest tech CEO of 2014. Wilson's efforts to transform the video game publisher produced strong returns for investors, as Electronic Arts shares doubled in 2014.
The rally continues: In after-hours trading on Tuesday, Electronic Arts shares rose more than 4% following the release of its third-quarter results. Electronic Arts continues to perform at a high level, as gamers eagerly snap up its titles.
Digital continues to accelerateOn an adjusted basis, Electronic Arts generated $1.428 billion in the third quarter -- more than the $1.275 billion it had previously projected, and more than the $1.29 billion consensus analyst estimate. Nearly half of that amount -- $693 million -- was from digitally distributed content (rather than physical discs). On a trailing-12-month basis, more than 50% of Electronic Arts' revenue is now coming from digital sales.
The bulk of that digital revenue is from the sale of extra content -- primarily DLC add-ons, which give gamers additional levels, weapons, and other content for their existing games. Sales of that extra content rose 47% on an annual basis.
Sales of full-game downloads (which replace physical discs entirely) also continue to ramp up, rising 22% on an annual basis to account for about one-fifth of Electronic Arts' digital revenue. Electronic Arts' other digital sources -- mobile and subscriptions -- had less of an impact on a percentage basis but also rose, up 13% and 52%, respectively.
The strong demand for Electronic Arts' games and digital services translated into better-than-expected earnings: In the third quarter, Electronic Arts earned an adjusted $1.22 -- better than the $0.90 it had previously guided, and more than $0.92 consensus analyst estimate.
Dragon Age: Inquisition breaks recordsDragon Age: Inquisition was Electronic Arts' premier title in the fourth quarter. The role-playing game doesn't have the sort of broad-based appeal of Electronic Arts' popular Madden and Battlefield franchises, but it still managed to set records for Electronic Arts' BioWare studio. It also earned numerous Game of the Year Awards for 2014, increasing Electronic Arts' cache among core gamers.
Mobile games are seeing increased engagementElectronic Arts is the leader in sports-based video games, with several core franchises including NHL, Madden, UFC, and FIFA. Although these franchises primarily serve console gamers, Electronic Arts has released some of them for mobile platforms.
Those mobile sports games are seeing increasing popularity: In the third quarter, monthly active players for Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team rose 45% on an annual basis. In total, Electronic Arts' mobile games averaged 160 million monthly active users in the third quarter.
In addition to its sports franchises, Electronic Arts has brought several of its other franchises to mobile. In December, it launched SimCity BuildIt -- a mobile adaptation of its long-running PC franchise, SimCity.
Benefiting from the new console cycle and a digital shiftOverall, the third quarter was strong for Electronic Arts, and its near-term prospects appear quite bullish. In calendar year 2014, Electronic Arts was the top publisher on both next-generation consoles -- PlayStation 4 and Xbox One -- and that could continue for some time. In March, Electronic Arts will release the next installment in its Battlefield series, and later in the year, it will launch Star Wars: Battlefront in concert with the debut of Star Wars: Episode 7.
The past 12 months have been great for Electronic Arts' shareholders, and as the current console cycle continues to ramp up, the video game publisher could continue to reward investors.

            ","The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) market index gained 12% in 2014. That's pretty much in line with the market's 12% to 13% annual returns over the long term. As always, some stocks ran ahead of the pack, raising the market's average returns.
Here are three of last year's biggest winners in the tech sector, including a couple of unexpected surprises. Video game publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) more than doubled in price, while high-tech materials maker Corning (NYSE:GLW) and social networking giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) crushed the market in a kinder, gentler way.
 Source: King of Hearts, via Wikimedia Commons.
The college of market-beating arts and sciencesStarting at the top, Electronic Arts delivered a shocking 105% gain in 2014 -- right on the heels of a 66% return in 2013.
This is largely an industrywide trend, as video game designers ride the support of recently updated consoles. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) nearly doubled over these two years, and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) gained an even stronger 160%.
But of course, none of them can hold a candle to Electronic Arts' sector-leading 242% gains, including the 105% last-year surge mentioned above.
Fellow Fool Sam Mattera pinpoints the company's fantastic performance to the hiring of CEO Andrew Wilson in the fall of 2013. Wilson has turned around a terrible public image with the help of a smart sales and marketing revamp, latching on to digital distribution methods in a big way.
Thanks to Wilson's sharp thinking and execution, Electronic Arts is delivering consistent earnings and sharply rising cash flows, underpinning the big market move with solid fundamentals.
If you saw this market-crushing year coming when Wilson took the CEO job -- an unheralded internal promotion, and not even the most likely Electronic Arts veteran for the post -- your crystal ball is way better than mine. Now, the stock looks poised to continue beating the market, fueled by Wilson's new-age strategy and starting from reasonable share prices of just 14 times trailing free cash flows.
How much longer will this be the social network?If Electronic Arts flew under the radar to get to the top, Facebook followed more of an open path. The social network beat back skeptics like yours truly by making large strides in mobile ad sales and delivering increasingly solid profits. Facebook's stock followed suit with a solid 43% gain.
Facebook is becoming a must-have advertising platform and a peerless viral marketing vehicle. My Foolish peers think it's just the beginning of a lasting trend, too.
Tim Brugger believes the stock can soar even higher in 2015, driven by efforts to make money from its splashy $2.7 billion Instagram buyout.
Brian Stoffel goes even further, calling Facebook a market-beater for the next decade. Why? Because founder and leader Mark Zuckerberg has a knack for finding the next big trend before the rest of us got tired of the last one. Instagram is just one example of this deep vision; Oculus Rift might be the next big winner.
This being the Motley Fool, I don't have to agree with my colleagues. My thumbs-down rating on Facebook is currently the biggest loser in my CAPS portfolio, but I have no plans to turn that frown upside down.
I'm impressed by Zuckerberg's success in 2014, but not convinced that he can keep the good times rolling. The social media market has a history of sudden, violent upheavals, and the younger generation is already showing signs of getting bored with current leader Facebook. If and when they move on to the next global water cooler, turning Facebook into the next MySpace (Ouch!) or Friendster (Who? Exactly!), I'd hate to have that stock in my retirement portfolio.
Facebook may make it through 2015 without hitting that brutal event. But for every year Facebook continues to lead its core market of social networking, I'm more convinced that it might be the last one. Don't back up the truck to this stock -- make sure you can afford to lose whatever you put into it.
Flat-out speedRounding out this market-beating rally, Corning turned a corner in 2014 with a 32% return on your investment.
Its mobile screen-cover dominance was threatened by up-and-coming sapphire alternatives, until that threat literally fell apart. Meanwhile, Corning presented even thinner and stronger Gorilla Glass products for mobile applications and made a play for large-screen television screens. That timing of that last move could prove prophetic if consumers around the world start upgrading their TV sets to next-generation 4K screens in 2015, as they very well might.
Until then, Corning investors can revel in a hockey-stick growth curve for the glassware veteran's cash flows. Despite Corning's huge share price gains in 2014, the market might still not have factored in all of its refreshed cash-making proficiency, not to mention the growth drivers already discussed:

GLW Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts.
Corning has close ties to the unstoppable mobile computing market, but it doesn't live and die by that industry alone. If you're looking for a proven veteran with diverse end-user markets and a rocket plume of momentum at its back, Corning might be worth a second look today.

            ","GameStop's (NYSE:GME) business model is broken, and the company has yet to find a solution.
Shares of the video game retailer plunged following the release of its third quarter earnings last week. New video game software sales -- GameStop's second-largest profit driver -- fell 9.3% on an annual basis. GameStop blamed a difficult comparison for the decline: last year's third quarter saw the release of Destiny, a much-hyped (though critically maligned) first-person shooter. The release of Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) Madden NFL 16, Metal Gear Solid 5, Halo 5, and Guitar Hero Live (among other games) were not enough to equal the demand for Destiny last year -- at least according to GameStop's management.
I've been a longtime GameStop bear and remain skeptical of the stock. The popularity of full-game downloads continues to increase, and GameStop's management is unable to address the threat.
Dodging the questionGameStop's business centers around the sale of video game discs, both new and used. Last quarter, 33.5% and 24.9% of GameStop's net sales came from new video games and used video games, respectively. GameStop sells new video game discs to consumers, and then buys them back later, only to resell them for a sizable profit. More than one-third of GameStop's total gross profit came from the sale of used games last quarter.
Source: GameStop third quarter earnings release
The continued shift toward digital downloads presents an existential threat to this model. If all (or most) video games are sold digitally in the form of a direct download, there's no disc for GameStop to sell (and then eventually resell).During GameStop's earnings call, Sterne Agee's Arvind Bhatia asked management what the company could do to crack into this market -- which, according to Electronic Arts, now represents about 20% of new game sales.
Bhatia: What do you think is your market share in digital downloads?...how do you become more of a destination place for digital downloads...?
GameStop CEO Paul Raines: I would say that, remember, that we are a player in digital downloads. I mean you don't do $228 million of digital receipts without having technologies, APIs, relationships, and all those things that you need to sell digital download...
GameStop COO Tony Bartel: Let me share some of that, Arvind. We don't give out specific market share of digital downloads or digital receipts, simply because it's really difficult to find that information. But let me give you some information from DFC...we find it to be one of the most credible source when we..look at digital share...According to DFC, in the third quarter, digital AAA sales for $60 game releases increased 6% over last year to 6% in total. And it represented only 9% of the total AAA sales mix. So that's coming from a source that we find very credible. So it grew 6% off of a very small base....
Raines: And you know the difficulty, of course, here is that digital is a complex animal and people, every publisher measures it in slightly different ways, et cetera... 
Bartel: ...And we anticipate that digital is going to continue to grow. And remember, that we grew 14% before [foreign-exchange], which is right in line with where the publishers grew. So we continue to see our digital continue to march forward at about the same rate that the publishers are seeing their digital growth.
In short: nothing. Rather than address Bhatia's question, GameStop's management stepped around it, offering no plan or strategy to capture demand for downloads. Instead, the company attempted to downplay the popularity of full-game downloads, and pointed to total digital receipts -- which is misleading. GameStop's digital business is composed of many different types of products, including pre-paid currency cards that can be used to purchase digital games through the various console storefronts, and Kongregate, its mobile game publishing platform.
The bulk of GameStop's digital business is likely coming from the sale of add-on (DLC) content. In recent years, major video game publishers have begun to supplement their games with additional downloadable content released several months after a game's debut. GameStop sells this content alongside physical game discs, encouraging customers who purchase a new game to pay for its DLC at the point of sale.
The issue is that these DLC sales are intrinsically linked to the demand for discs, and if gamers stop coming into GameStop's stores, there's no reason to believe this business will survive. I can't say for certain because GameStop won't disclose it, but I would assume it sells virtually no full-game downloads at all. There's simply no reason to purchase a full-game download through GameStop when you can just buy it through your Xbox or PlayStation console. To use an analogy, it would be the equivalent of going to Blockbuster to purchase a code for a digital movie you then redeem on iTunes -- an utterly nonsensical proposition.
Star Wars disappoints GameStop, but sets a digital recordEA's Star Wars: Battlefront wasn't included in GameStop's third quarter report, but will play a key role in its fourth quarter results. It made its debut earlier this month, and according to GameStop, suffered from soft sales. ""Battlefront fell short of expectations,"" said Bartel during the call.
But did it fall short of Electronic Arts' expectations? In a blog post released (perhaps not so coincidentally) shortly after GameStop's call, Electronic Arts wrote that the game was ""the largest digital launch in the history"" of the company. Rather than head to GameStop for their copy of Battlefront, gamers may have stayed home, purchasing it directly through their consoles.
GameStop is profitable, and pays a fairly sizable dividend (it currently yields more than 3.5%), but with so much of its sales and profit tied to video game discs, it remains immensely challenged.

            ","Brewer Constellation Brands was one favorite of this hedge-fund giant. Image source: Constellation Brands.
Many individual investors look to professional hedge-fund managers for ideas on smart stocks to buy. Lone Pine Capital has been a successful hedge fund for years, with Steve Mandel at the helm directing its investments. In its latest release of its holdings, Lone Pine revealed that it had made some big acquisitions, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). With Lone Pine having built up positions that were worth more than $1.9 billion at the end of September, individual investors can see evidence of Mandel's confidence in these three stocks. Let's look more closely at what Lone Pine did and whether these three stocks make sense for you.
Betting big on e-commerce Lone Pine's new position in Amazon.com is its biggest of the quarter, with the company building up a 1.94 million share position in the e-commerce giant. That made Lone Pine's stake in the company worth nearly $1 billion, making up more than 4% of its almost $25 billion portfolio of reportable holdings. Lone Pine has had investments in Amazon in the past, but they have tended to be opportunistic and short-term in nature.
Amazon has long been a controversial stock, as its revenue growth hasn't yet resulted in the level of profitability that many investors would prefer to see. Recently, Amazon has appeared to take steps to start remedying that situation, with the stock soaring more than 22% in October after the company reported more than half a billion dollars in operating income solely from its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing and web-hosting service. Investors have been willing to accept that Amazon's future promise justifies an ever-increasing share price even in the absence of more substantial profits, and Lone Pine appears to see the company as representative of the hedge fund's broader commitment to disruptive technology companies.
Brewing up big gains? Constellation Brands represents a more modest investment for Lone Pine, but the position that the hedge fund took involves a larger percentage of the beer and spirits-maker's market capitalization. Lone Pine bought more than 4.68 million shares of Constellation Brands, building up a 2.7% position that was worth more than $586 million at quarter-end. Unlike with Amazon, Lone Pine hasn't dabbled in Constellation stock in the past.
Constellation has moved aggressively toward building up its beer portfolio. After a major acquisition of brands Corona and Modelo in 2013, Constellation just announced the $1 billion buyout of craft-beer company Ballast Point Brewing. Ballast Point will add 40 beer brands to Constellation's lineup, including the well-regarded Sculpin India pale ale. Other major players have made big moves in the beer space lately, and Constellation hopes that greater exposure to craft beer will put it in better position to keep its competitive edge going forward.
Winning the game Lone Pine's investment in video game manufacturer Electronic Arts wasn't a new purchase, but the hedge fund dramatically increased its stake. Lone Pine's purchase of nearly 8 million shares during the quarter brought its total holdings to 8.78 million shares, and the shares that the hedge fund bought was worth about $541 million at the end of the quarter.
EA has profited greatly from long-running franchises like Madden NFL and other sports-related games, but a lot of the buzz surrounding the video game maker lately has come from its latest installment of its Battlefield series, which incorporates a licensing agreement that allowed it to take place in the Star Wars universe and was released in mid-November. Given the upcoming release of new movies in the Star Wars franchise, EA expected huge demand for the game, and many investors immediately concluded that Star Wars: Battlefield would become a multiyear success with plenty of potential for future sequels. The company is being smart about managing those expectations, but EA could nevertheless enjoy nice gains riding Star Wars coattails.
Lone Pine's buys are diverse and show the scope that Mandel and his team have in looking for good prospects. Each of these three stocks looks promising and could fit well in the stock portfolios of many individual investors.

            ","Shares of video game publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA)  fell after retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) reported weak third-quarter earnings on Nov 23. GameStop stock plunged as much as 16% that day, while EA stock slid about 6%. It might seem logical to dump a game publisher's stock after a major game retailer misses earnings expectations, but it doesn't really make much sense due to the differences between physical and digital distribution.

Source: GameStop.
How bad was GameStop's quarter?Last quarter, GameStop's revenue fell 3.6% annually to $2.02 billion and missed estimates by $120 million. Net income fell 11.4% to $57 million, or $0.54 per share, which missed expectations by $0.05. Same-store sales declined 1.1% annually, compared to an increase of 8.1% in the second quarter. Here's how GameStop fared across its six main product categories:

At first glance, it looks like sales of consoles and video games are falling across the board. However, console sales were expected to slow down, since the PS4 and Xbox One have both been on the market for two years. Sales of physical software were also expected to fall, due to the growth of digital distribution channels. GameStop's digital games revenue also shouldn't be considered a bellwether for the digital market, since many gamers download games directly from the PlayStation Store, Xbox One Game Store, or Steam.
Simply put, customers buy consoles from GameStop, but they gradually lose touch with the retailer as the hardware ages. These customers then cut GameStop out of the sales loop by buying games through other digital distribution channels. GameStop is trying to counter this trend by offering more digital downloads and diversifying into consumer electronics, but those businesses still generate a small percentage of its overall revenue.
Why EA is differentUnlike GameStop, Electronic Arts has made a fairly smooth transition to the digital gaming model. Last quarter, non-GAAP packaged goods revenue (58% of sales) fell 13% to $666 million, but digital revenues (42% of sales) rose 6% annually to $480 million. Sixteen percent of those digital revenues came from full game downloads, 42% came from extra content like DLCs, 17% came from subscriptions and advertising, and 25% came from mobile games.
EA earned 74.5% of its revenues from consoles during the quarter. In addition to selling digital games through the PlayStation and Xbox One Stores, it recently partnered with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to deliver cloud-based games to TVs via its X1 set-top boxes. That partnership enables Xfinity subscribers to use a mobile device as a controller to play EA games streamed over the Internet. Last year, EA introduced EA Access, a subscription-based service which grants Xbox One gamers unlimited access to select titles. These initiatives will ensure that digital revenues flow from living rooms back to EA.

EA Access. Source: EA.
On PCs, EA sells its digital games through Origin, a Steam-like DRM platform which has over 50 million users. By keeping its games within this walled garden, EA maintains tighter control over pricing. It is also reportedly planning an EA Access-like subscription service for Origin. EA's PC/browser revenues accounted for 14.4% of its sales last quarter.
EA's total non-GAAP revenues fell 5.7% annually last quarter to $1.15 billion, which still beat estimates by $50 million. That slowdown wasn't surprising, due to currency headwinds and tough comparisons to last year, when The Sims 4 launched. But looking ahead, EA expects a strong holiday quarter thanks to the launch of Star Wars: Battlefront. For that quarter, EA expects non-GAAP EPS of $1.75 on revenue of $1.78 billion, which exceeds the consensus estimate for EPS of $1.73 on $1.75 billion in revenue.
Comparing apples to orangesGameStop and EA run on very different business models: Sluggish sales of new hardware and software at GameStop doesn't mean that sales of all games are sliding -- it just means that the distribution model is changing.
This doesn't necessarily mean that EA is an ideal investment at current prices. EA has high expectations for the holiday quarter, but the period could still be rough on margins due to steep discounts and the aggressive bundling of top games with new consoles. However, investors shouldn't sell EA simply because GameStop had a rough quarter.

            ","Video game giant Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) posted strong fiscal second quarter results, beating both its own guidance and analyst expectations. Yet shares fell following the release, as its outlook may not have been as optimistic as investors anticipated. During the subsequent earnings call, CEO Andrew Wilson, CFO Blake Jorgensen, and COO Peter Moore commented on a number of trends affecting the business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that discussion.
A different strategy for mobile gamesThe bulk of Electronic Arts' business continues to come from more traditional gaming platforms -- consoles and the PC. But Electronic Arts does have a respectable mobile business. Mobile games generated around 10% of its revenue on an adjusted basis last quarter. During the call, Wilson discussed a strategic shift the company made this quarter and how it affected one of its more popular mobile titles:
Madden NFL Mobile launched a full-game update this year instead of a new app download. The result was a seamless experience for players, which increased retention and resulted in game sessions up more than 300% over last year.
Demand for EA Access is risingLast July, Electronic Arts announced EA Access, a digital subscription service that gave Xbox One owners the ability to, for a flat monthly or annual fee, play a collection of older Electronic Arts titles. EA Access subscribers also get a discount on new releases and early access to upcoming games. However, Electronic Arts has not offered up exact subscriber figures, instead lumping it with its subscriptions and advertising revenue. That figure contracted slightly on an annual basis last quarter, from 91 million to 83 million on an adjusted basis, but EA Access may not have been responsible for that decline. During the call, Wilson commented on the service's growth in general:
EA Access is accelerating. The subscriber base more than doubled in the last two quarters. We've added five new games to The Vault this year, and we're excited about what we're learning as players engage through this service. These titles ... are giving us strong momentum moving into the holiday season.
On guidanceElectronic Arts raised its guidance for its full fiscal year, but its revenue outlook fell slightly short of analyst estimates. Mirror's Edge Catalyst was expected to debut in Electronic Arts' fiscal fourth quarter, but it has been delayed until May, shifting it out of the fiscal year. During the call, Jorgensen explained Electronic Arts' outlook:
Due to our continued strong performance, we are again increasing our full-year outlook. The open beta for Star Wars: Battlefront was exceptionally well received by players. Consequently, we're raising our unit forecast for sell-in during fiscal year 2016 to approximately 13 million units. This is partially offset by increased FX headwinds and our decision to move Mirror's Edge Catalyst into fiscal 2017.
The popularity of full-game downloads is increasing but not in every regionElectronic Arts' console games are its largest segment by revenue. Console games are still sold primarily on physical discs, but in the past, management has expressed its interest in eventually converting entirely to digital. Owners of modern consoles have the option to download games rather than buy a disc. During the call, Jorgensen commented on the trends the company is seeing in full-game downloads.
Our new titles in the quarter averaged around 20% full-game downloads with the exception of FIFA, which skewed lower [because of its European popularity]. ... In terms of the full-game downloads, a couple things to remember; we still sell [PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 games], and [gamers who own those consoles] are typically doing full-game downloads [less often]. ... Second, our [second-quarter] business, particularly FIFA, is skewed heavily toward Europe, and two factors bring down full-game downloads ... in Europe. One is bandwidth speeds in some countries. And two is many retailers in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, use FIFA as a way of driving traffic into the store, and they like a physical copy to help do that. We're seeing very strong full-game downloads continue in North America. ... [For PC games] we see full-game downloads there roughly 75%. ... We believe in the full-game download opportunity for us going forward.
Battlefront 2 in 2016?Electronic Arts will release Star Wars: Battlefront on Nov. 17. It should be one of the most popular games released this year. Could it become an annual franchise for Electronic Arts? During the call, Wilson commented on that possibility, suggesting that it probably wouldn't be the case but that the company's commitment to Star Wars is only just beginning.
Around Star Wars and annualization -- again, what we have talked about is we have a long-term partnership around the Star Wars license, and we expect that we will launch many titles as part of that long-term relationship. ... We still have 6 million people engaging regularly in both Battlefield 4 [released in 2013] and Battlefield Hardline [released earlier this year]. ... We think about our business not just as a launch business, but as a large service and relationship business that we factor in when it's appropriate to launch new things. ... Certainly, expect more Star Wars titles from us, but no decision made as to specific timing as yet.

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) shares were down 4% at 10:55 a.m. Friday following the release on Thursday of the video-game giant's fiscal-second-quarter earnings report. Electronic Arts earned an adjusted $0.65 per share on adjusted revenue of $1.146 billion.
Both figures handily beat analyst expectations. Wall Street had been expecting Electronic Arts to earn around $0.45 per share on sales of around $1.10 billion. Let's take a closer look at Electronic Arts' results.
Raising guidance -- againThe negative response to Electronic Arts' earnings report may have been predicated on the company's outlook. Although Electronic Arts raised its full-year outlook for the second time this year, it still fell slightly short of analyst estimates. For fiscal year 2016, which ends next March, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $3.00 per share on revenue of around $4.5 billion. Analysts had projected Electronic Arts to earn less (around $2.96 per share), but bring in more revenue -- around $4.53 billion.
Next quarter, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $1.75 per share on adjusted revenue of around $1.775 billion. Analysts had been anticipating earnings of around $1.74 on revenue of around $1.74 billion.
It's worth noting, however, that Electronic Arts' management has been particularly conservative in recent quarters, guiding to numbers that they seem to always handily beat. This quarter, in particular, Electronic Arts crushed its own estimates -- its adjusted earnings per share of $0.65 was well above its $0.40 guidance, while its adjusted net revenue of $1.146 billion was a bit more than its $1.075 billion forecast. Despite the decline, Electronic Arts' shares are up more than 200% in the last two years. Investors may have simply expected more from a company that's been firing on all cylinders.
Dominating the next generationIn the West, Electronic Arts has been the top publisher on both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One this year. Electronic Arts drew particular attention to its annual sports franchises to explain its success -- in particular, strong demand for FIFA and Madden NFL have benefited the company. This quarter, Electronic Arts released three sports titles -- NHL 16, FIFA 16, and Madden NFL 16 -- and monthly average players for the three titles rose 30% on an annual basis.
Revenue from the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 rose 48% on an annual basis, although demand for Electronic Arts' titles on older platforms saw a similar decline. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 revenue declined 43%, and those consoles now generate less than one-third as much adjusted revenue for Electronic Arts as their successors. Adjusted console revenue in total rose 5% on an annual basis.
Electronic Arts' PC revenue also notably declined, falling 38% on an adjusted basis. This was likely due to the release of the Sims 4 last September -- this year, Electronic Arts had no similar PC title, making a comparison difficult. Adjusted mobile revenue experienced a slight decline, falling 6%.
Digital takes a larger slice of the pieElectronic Arts' sales from digital channels -- as opposed to physical game discs by traditional retailers -- climbed to 42% of Electronic Arts' adjusted revenue, from 37% in the same quarter last year. Full-game downloads were flat, at 8%, but sales of extra DLC rose to 17% of adjusted revenue (from 13% last year), and packaged goods fell to 58% (from 63% in the same quarter last year). The move to digital is beneficial for the company's margins, and Electronic Arts executives have previously said they intend to eventually derive 100% of their revenue from digital channels.
Overall, it was a fairly boring quarter for the company -- not particularly phenomenal or discouraging. Next quarter, with the important holiday shopping season and the launch of Star Wars: Battlefront, should be more interesting.

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is about to release what could become the best-selling video game of the year.
Star Wars Battlefront is a first-person shooter from Electronic Arts' DICE studio, the longtime maker of the popular Battlefield franchise. It's slated to make its retail debut on Nov. 17, about one month before the release of next Star Wars film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Given the fervor currently surrounding all things Star Wars, Battlefront seems likely to smash Electronic Arts's expectations, which have been fairly modest.
Around 9 million or 10 million copiesTo date, management's guidance for Battlefront has been conservative. In May, CFO Blake Jorgensen said Electronic Arts expected to sell around 9 million to 10 million copies of the game, based on the relative success similar titles have had in the past.
Battlefield doesn't carry the Star Wars branding, but it offers a similar experience -- both games are team-based, first-person military shooters. Generally, those games sell around 15 million copies. Some Battlefield players could be turned off by the science fiction theme of Battlefront, but many longtime Battlefield players seem likely to convert.
The other game worth keeping in mind is the original Star Wars: Battlefront. That game was released in 2004, about eight months before the release of the film Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. It was made by a different game studio, released by LucasArts, and was a slightly different sort of game (a third-person shooter), but it does offer some hints as to what level of success can be expected from this new Battlefront. It sold 9 million copies.
In July, Electronic Arts raised its full-year guidance. Management said Battlefront played a key role in that shift, but declined to update its expectations in terms of unit sales. Notably, Battlefront will be exclusive to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC -- owners of the older Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles will not be able to play the game. Unfortunately, that may eliminate many potential buyers. But not too many.
Demand for Star Wars has been unprecedentedTwo years after their debuts, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have combined to sell perhaps 40 million units (the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 25 million; Xbox One sales have not been officially confirmed, but estimates peg the number at between 10 million and 15 million) and millions more may be sold this holiday shopping season. In March, Electronic Arts released the most recent installment in the Battlefield series, Battlefield: Hardline. According to the company, about 80% of the game's sales were for the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One platforms.
Star Wars mania has undeniably pervaded popular culture, and the game should benefit from the release of the latest film. Ticket sales for The Force Awakens have already smashed existing pre-sale records, and some analysts expect the film to eventually generate as much as $2 billion worldwide. Fans excited from watching the latest trailer could turn to Battlefront to satisfy their Star Wars itch in the weeks leading up to its launch.
There's other evidence to suggest Battlefront should perform exceptionally well. Earlier this month, Electronic Arts ran a test of the game's servers, allowing players to try the game for free. It wasn't meant to advertise, but rather ensure that Electronic Arts' online infrastructure could support it. Over 9.5 million players participated -- more than any other beta test in Electronic Arts' history -- with two-thirds achieving the max level cap (suggesting they had invested at least several hours). This was particularly impressive given that the game was only available to play for a few days.
Electronic Arts continues to reward shareholdersElectronic Arts shareholders could be rewarded for Battlefront's success before the game is even released. The video game publisher will report its quarterly earnings Thursday afternoon, and it could raise its guidance even further to reflect heightened excitement around Battlefront.
To be fair, Battlefront does face some tough competition this fall -- both Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and Halo 5 will offer first-person shooter fans strong alternatives -- but based on the excitement around the revival of the film franchise, there's every reason to expect the game to be a massively popular seller.

It's been five years since Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) hung up its stringless six-string, but it's never too late to start strumming again. Guitar Hero Live hits stores on Tuesday, and with that comes the hope that musical-timing games rock back into fashion. 
Activision Blizzard had a hit on its hands a decade ago. It was the publisher for the original Guitar Hero, developed by RedOctane and Harmonix in 2005. It liked what it saw, snapping up RedOctane two years later. Harmonix would go on to be acquired by MTV Games, turning to Activision Blizzard rival Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) to distribute its competing Rock Band franchise. 
Gamers ate up the niche, for a few years at least. Players took to guitars, microphones, and faux drum kits as controllers. Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts were the toast of the town. The genre breathed new life into the gaming market at a time when the Wii was already getting gamers to stand up and move. Small-box specialty retailers may have resisted at first. They had to give up shelf and storage space that was once dedicated to new and secondhand games to make room for bulky plastic guitars and drum kits. However, once the games started selling and crowds started to gather to watch folks play air guitar, it helped spark a retail revolution. 
By the time Activision Blizzard seemed to have milked the last bit of amp juice out of the franchise, it had spawned six generations of the game, as well as the short-lived DJ Hero and Band Hero spinoffs. Sales peaked in 2008, and by the time that the final entry rolled out in 2010 it was a fair bet that we would never be collecting guitar controllers again.
Well, that can all change on Tuesday. Guitar Hero Live is an evolutionary upgrade, offering an enhanced live concert experience. There are dozens of songs to cycle through, and folks can go online for roughly 200 more freely available tracks to play. If you're eyeing an opportunity to reconnect with all of the old Guitar Hero controllers collecting dust in your closet, you're out of luck. Guitar Hero Live features a totally new six-button fret interface. 
If this is a hit, we're talking about a lot of money spent on new hardware, and Activision Blizzard can certainly use that. Its revenue peaked in 2012. With once iconic franchises including Skylanders, World of Warcraft, and Guitar Hero sliding in popularity, it would be a real game changer if it's able to give its guitar-pecking series a second act. 
It's throwing plenty of marketing muscle behind the move. It's taking a page out of the Electronic Arts playbook by bringing in celebrities to pump up excitement. The promotional trailer stars Lenny Kravitz and James Franco in an amusing exchange. It's not the massive mini-movie effort that Electronic Arts used two months ago in trying to generate buzz for Madden 16, but it's a smart approach.
The game's coming. Now it's time to see if the encore is worthy of a standing ovation.

            ","This year has already seen some high-profile video game releases, but many of the biggest titles of 2015 are yet to come.
Gaming companies including Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are counting on recording big hits before the year is out and have big upcoming releases vying for consumer attention during the biggest spending months of the year. It's a crowded field, but a handful of titles are poised to stand out.

            ","Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) management had a lot to say on the company's first quarter earnings call.
CEO Andrew Wilson, CFO Blake Jorgensen, and COO Peter Moore commented on a variety of factors affecting Electronic Arts' business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that call.
More games are coming to the vaultLast year, Electronic Arts announced EA Access, a subscription-based digital service that gives Xbox One owners access to a variety of older Electronic Arts games for a relatively modest fee. Unfortunately, Electronic Arts does not break out the number of subscribers it has to the service, but during the call, Jorgensen highlighted the company's continued commitment.
""EA Access is delivering strong, sustained growth, and we continue to build its value to gamers as we add more games to the Vault. Titanfall is now in the Vault and Dragon Age: Inquisition will join it at the end of the summer, bringing the total titles to 13.""
Sims 4 and foreign exchangeElectronic Arts shares fell in after-hours trading on Thursday following the release of its first quarter results. Although they exceeded analyst expectations for the current quarter, its outlook fell short. During the call, Jorgensen offered up an explanation.
""Guidance for our second quarter is for [adjusted] net revenue to be $1.075 billion, 12% lower than last year's $1.22 billion. In this quarter, we're launching Madden NFL, FIFA, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, NHL and NBA Live. While last year's Q2 saw the launches of our major sports titles, it also included The Sims 4. In addition, FX presents a year on year impact of around $100 million to Q2 revenues.""
A strong slate of upcoming titlesAs a video game publisher, Electronic Arts' performance depends on the demand for its games. During the call, Wilson outlined several of the company's long-term projects.
""Looking further ahead, we're preparing more new games for our players. The reaction to a first look at Mass Effect: Andromeda at E3 was incredibly positive. We have a new Battlefield experience coming in Q3 FY 2017 and another new Star Wars project""
Star Wars will be a major part of EA's futureStars Wars: Battlefront could be the biggest game Electronic Arts releases this year. The first-person shooter is based on the long-running sci-fi series and is set to arrive in stores this November, ahead of the release of the next Star Wars film. But Electronic Arts' commitment to Star Wars involves much more than one game. During the call, Jorgensen hinted at additional titles.
""We don't have the timetable yet to announce those, but trust that you will see multiple Star Wars titles both on console and PC, as well as on mobile. We have at least one mobile title that's going to come out this year and we have more in the process as well. So lots to come on Star Wars, and you'll hear about that as we discuss our future guidance. We're very excited about the franchise and about our partnership.""
Free-to-play Titanfall probably won't be a big profit driverElectronic Arts released Titanfall for the Xbox One and PC in March of last year. An Xbox 360 version soon followed. Titanfall isn't a completely traditional first-person shooter, but it does adhere to traditional pricing -- if they wish to play it, gamers must pay to purchase it. But Electronic Arts will soon release a free-to-play version of Titanfall in Asia. When asked about this development, Moore made no sweeping promises. Instead, he characterized it as an experiment -- not a major new source of revenue.
""Think of this as a classic free-to-play game there, but do not think of this as being particularly material to revenue. It's an interesting experiment in looking at that type of game and whether it plays in a free-to-play environment. We'll be interested to see the results.""

            ","Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) cable box is now a video game console.
After months of speculation, the cable giant has officially unveiled its partnership with Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). Using a Comcast Internet connection and Xfinity X1 set-top box, customers can stream select gaming titles over the Internet to their televisions. Although the partnership may not disrupt the current console gaming landscape in the near-term, it represents an interesting new market and an opportunity -- both for Electronic Arts and for Comcast.

Comcast's cloud-based set-top box adds a new featureComcast's X1 set-top box is among the most advanced in the industry. Initially unveiled in 2012, the X1 supports voice commands, offers a cloud-based DVR and personalized recommendations, and can run third-party apps, including Pandora. Comcast's management has said it planned to improve the X1's features over time. Xfinity Games stands as the latest, and perhaps most significant, upgrade.
Players can choose from a catalog of select Electronic Arts titles, including Plants vs Zombies, FIFA 13, and NBA Jam. Games are played using tablets or smartphones connected over Wi-Fi rather than with standard controllers. Comcast's X1 isn't capable of actually running the games -- they're played on distant servers, then beamed over the Internet to subscribers' set-top boxes.
A way to stem subscriber losses?Currently, Comcast is offering the service for free to select participants in its beta test. That might eventually change to a model built around subscriptions.
Alternatively, Comcast could see additional revenue from increased data usage. On its Xfinity Games website, Comcast makes it clear that games streamed over its network count toward customers' Internet data caps. Comcast's cap varies based on region -- and it doesn't enforce a cap everywhere -- but where it is enforced, it charges an additional $10 per month for every 50GB used above the cap.
Xfinity Games could also serve as a way to keep Comcast's cable subscribers loyal. Earlier this month, Comcast revealed that it now has more Internet subscribers (22.6 million) than cable TV customers (22.3 million). Streaming video services and Internet-based, pay-TV alternatives have made living without cable an increasingly viable option. Those who want to take advantage of Xfinity Games, however, will need a Comcast set-top box and pay-TV subscription.
A new market for Electronic Arts' gamesFor Electronic Arts, Xfinity Games offers up a new avenue for revenue beyond its traditional console, PC, and mobile offerings. Electronic Arts has not disclosed how much Comcast is paying for the service, but may shed some light on the deal later this week when it turns in its quarterly earnings.
This service is not likely to affect Electronic Arts' results to a material degree in the near future, but if Xfinity Games proves popular, it could open up a new market. As it stands, Electronic Arts is limited in its ability to sell television-based games to those with relatively expensive game consoles. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 have sold tens of millions of units globally, but the majority of American households don't have either box. Some of those are undoubtedly Comcast TV subscribers who could be lured by the company's latest offering.
Last year, Electronic Arts launched EA Access, the first subscription-based game offering from a major publisher. Partnering with a cable provider to offer streaming games is another first for Electronic Arts and the industry in general. If nothing else, Xfinity Games demonstrates the increasing degree to which Electronic Arts' management is innovating.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) shares fell in after-hours trading on Thursday following the release of the company's fiscal-first-quarter earnings report. Although Electronic Arts beat analyst expectations for the current quarter, its outlook for the second quarter and full year proved disappointing. Let's dig in to Electronic Arts' report.
A strong quarter despite an empty release scheduleAs a video game publisher, Electronic Arts depends on the sale of its games to drive its financial performance. But the majority of Electronic Arts' titles are released in the fall and winter; in the first quarter, Electronic Arts published no new games of note.
Still, it earned an adjusted $0.15 per share on adjusted net revenue of $693 million. Analysts had expected Electronic Arts to earn just $0.03 on revenue of around $652 million. Management cited demand for games released in prior periods, as well as revenue related to its digital services.
Packaged goods -- physical CDs -- generated just 23% of Electronic Arts' adjusted net revenue in the first quarter, down from 38% in the same quarter last year. Full-game downloads rose to 12% from 9%, while DLC (downloadable content) grew to 37% from 27% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. Subscription-related revenue remained stable at 10%, and mobile revenue grew to 18% from 16% in the same quarter last year.
Given the lack of new titles in the first quarter, Electronic Arts focused on its upcoming slate. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in June, Electronic Arts' upcoming games won a combined 132 awards. Although these rewards mean little in terms of financial performance, they serve to underscore the relative strength of the company's pipeline.
But EA's outlook falls shortThursday's sell-off was likely fueled by Electronic Arts' outlook. Although it raised its full-year guidance, it still fell short of what analysts had been anticipating.
In fiscal year 2016, which ends in March 2016, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $2.85 per share on adjusted net revenue of $4.450 billion. Analysts had projected $2.87 per share on revenue of around $4.48 billion. More significant is Electronic Arts' second-quarter outlook. In that quarter, Electronic Arts expects to earn an adjusted $0.40 per share on adjusted net revenue of $1.075 billion. Analysts had expected quite a bit more -- $0.67 on revenue of $1.12 billion.
If recent history is any indication, Electronic Arts' guidance is likely extremely conservative. Electronic Arts' results exceeded management's expectations in every single quarter of its fiscal year 2015. In the fourth quarter, for example, Electronic Arts had guided for adjusted earnings of $0.22 per share on adjusted net revenue of $830 million. In reality, Electronic Arts earned an adjusted $0.39 on adjusted net revenue of $896 million. 
In recent quarters, Electronic Arts has been one of the best-performing tech stocks. Shares of the video game giant are up better than 100% in the last 12 months. The rally has been fueled by a steady stream of better-than-expected earnings reports -- in January, and again in May, shares surged following the release of quarterly results that exceeded expectations.

EA data by YCharts.
Demand for next-generation consoles has been strong, and Electronic Arts' multiple has risen along with its stock. With a trailing price-to-earnings ratio near 26, investors appear to be expecting strong growth.
The sell-off is a minor speed bump for longer-term shareholders, but not particularly surprising. Electronic Arts' business continues to perform, but given its valuation, any doubts about its future prospects will likely weigh on its shares.

5 Big Winners, data by YCharts.
The stock market is having a quiet year in 2015. The famed S&P 500 index is up a meager 2.3% since the New Year, and the Dow Jones Industrials index has lost 0.4%.
But there are always exceptions to the rule. We asked a panel of Motley Fool contributors to outline the five biggest surprises they've seen in 2015, and this is what they came up with.
Here, you'll find a few long-running turnaround stories such as video-game designer Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and casino operator Isle of Capri Casinos (NASDAQ:ISLE). Digital entertainment veteran Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), meanwhile, is going from strength to strength, and former bargain-bin shoe designer Skechers USA (NYSE:SKX) has become a powerhouse footwear brand in its own right. And what the heck is Natural Health Trends (NASDAQ:NHTC), other than a market-crushing titan in 2015? You'll soon find out.
These stocks have gained between 54% and 152% so far this year -- and that includes retreats from much loftier yearly highs in some cases. Dig into these juicy stock stories right here:
Image source: Netflix.
Brian Stoffel (Netflix): Let's consider where Netflix stood when it entered 2015. Although the company's stock had fallen 25% in the last three months of 2014, it still traded for a hefty valuation.
Shares were valued at 90 times trailing earnings, and Netflix hadn't produced positive free cash flow during the year. The company had just announced ambitious plans to expand to nearly every country on the map, and warned that it would take a while before its investments truly paid off.
Since then, the stock has more than doubled -- up an amazing 125% in just seven months' time. While it's still a mighty expensive holding -- now over 300 times trailing earnings -- the company's success at growing its subscriber base truly stands out.
Total global streaming subscriptions rose a whopping 30% to 65.5 million from the second quarter of 2014 to the same time frame this year. The biggest gains came outside the U.S. One year ago, there were 13.8 million international subscribers to Netflix services. That number has jumped almost 70% since then to 23.25 million. That kind of growth shows just how popular Netflix is with an international audience, and why the stock has done so well over such a short time frame.

Rich Duprey (Isle of Capri Casinos): For a casino operator that once seemed to be on its deathbed as the island gambling oasis of Macau off mainland China attracted betting and investment dollars, Isle of Capri Casinos has to be one of the most surprising turnaround stories -- not only of this year, but of the past few years.
The casino operator's recovery began last year, but has accelerated in earnest in 2015, with shares more than doubling since the start of the year.
Isle of Capri Casinos owns or operates 15 casinos in seven states, and strong performance has fueled its drive higher, with revenue and earnings topping analyst expectations. A continuously improving economy and more disposable cash in consumers' pockets have been big factors in helping the casino operator outpace even its thriving industry.
Unlike other bigger, more well-known players, Isle of Capri Casinos doesn't have exposure to Macau. Thus, when revenue there started to plummet last year after a crackdown on corruption, the U.S.-based operator, whose properties are mostly in secondary markets, was unfazed. This has helped its stock perform far better than its gaming peers.
There also doesn't appear to be any danger of the casino rolling snake eyes anytime soon, which makes Isle of Capri Casinos my most surprising stock of 2015.
ReStor Vital is one of Natural Health Trends' core brands. Image source: Natural Health Trends.
Anders Bylund (Natural Health Trends): Did you know that Natural Health Trends shares have soared 150% higher so far in 2015? That the stock is up a massive 250% over the last year?
More to the point -- did you know that Natural Health Trends existed before clicking on this article?
Natural Health Trends is a multi-level marketing firm, relying on a network of customers-slash-contractors to sell the company's products. You could think of the company as the Tupperware of beauty products and nutritional supplements. If you've run across brands such as Valura, Skindulgence, Premium Noni Juice, or ReStor Vital, you've seen Natural Health Trends in action. You just didn't necessarily know it at the time.
So why is this no-name business storming up the charts in 2015?
Well, Natural Health Trends is enjoying a golden age in international markets. Specifically, sales in Hong Kong accounted for 92% of the company's revenue in the recently reported first quarter, on the back of an 80% year-over-year sales increase. Hong Kong is the company's gateway into China -- a local shipping center for customers and marketing partners in the Chinese mainland.
With China playing such a crucial role in Natural Health Trends' business results via that Hong Kong link, the company itself is pretty much a proxy for that particular Far Eastern market. Overall, first-quarter sales increased 76%, and net income more than doubled.
That being said, Natural Health Trends remains a micro-cap stock with a market cap of just over $300 million. In spite of the massive gains in the stock's rearview mirror, the share price has actually fallen about 45% from its 52-week high, with half of that decline coming in the past week and a half.
The Chinese consumer market isn't looking terribly healthy at the moment, and in America, networks of so-called independent contractors may soon be reclassified as taxable and benefits-laden employees.
Natural Health Trends is a risky stock with absolutely zero analyst coverage. I mean, the company issued a celebratory press release when it was selected for inclusion in the Russell 3000 and Russell Microcap indices, which is a far cry from joining the Dow or the S&P 500.
Long story short: If you're looking for stability and future promise, Natural Health Trends may not be for you. But the stock is hard to beat when it comes to momentum-driven rocket tickers at the moment.
That counts as a major surprise in my book.

Dan Caplinger (Electronic Arts): It wasn't so long ago that many had declared the era of traditional video games dead, with the potential competition from mobile devices and other newer options threatening the viability of console-based video gaming. Yet Electronic Arts has defied calls for its early demise, with the stock vaulting higher by 57% so far in 2015 after roughly doubling in 2014.
Electronic Arts' renaissance came largely thanks to new hardware from the major game-console makers, which gave EA a chance to showcase its game-making capabilities. With core franchises including Battlefield, Dragon Age, and sports must-haves like the Madden series of football video games, Electronic Arts has attracted gamers of all ages.
At the same time, EA has addressed some of the quality concerns that its customers had, with new games like Titanfall getting critical acclaim. EA's subscription service has also had early success. It offers gamers a chance to try older titles that they otherwise wouldn't buy, but at a price they're willing to pay, generating recurring revenue for the company.
Given how far it climbed in 2014, EA didn't have many investors thinking 2015 would be equally impressive. For now, though, Electronic Arts is executing flawlessly, and that bodes well for its future prospects.

Tamara Walsh (Skechers): In the past, when you wanted to buy a pair of knock-off sneakers, Skechers was your one-stop shop. Today, however, the retailer has evolved from a cheap purveyor of off-brand footwear into the number two brand share position in the U.S. athletic footwear market. As if that isn't surprising enough, the stock has gained an eye-popping 124% so far in 2015. Shares are now trading at an all-time high around $124 per share.
Skechers shocked Wall Street earlier this year after delivering blowout first-quarter results in which sales climbed a record 40% to $768 million. Earnings for the period also topped expectations, coming in at $1.10 per share. The strong fiscal 2015 first-quarter results came on the heels of an annual sales record of $2.4 billion in 2014.
It seems Skechers has a winning formula. The company isn't shy about using celebrity endorsements to move its products, including deals with world famous drummer Ringo Starr, recording artist Demi Lovato, and legendary quarterbacks Joe Montana and Joe Namath, to name a few. With the stock now trading near an all-time high, investors may want to remain on the sidelines for now. Nonetheless, it will be interesting to see if Skechers continues to surprise us in the quarters ahead.

            ","The leisure products industry includes companies across multiple sectors, including toys, video games, sports equipment, and recreational vehicles. These stocks often rise when the economy is healthy, unemployment is low, and disposable income is high. They fall out of favor when the opposite happens, since they aren't considered as essential as food and clothing.

Let's take a look at two top stocks investors should watch in this industry -- toymaker Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) and video game publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).
HasbroShares of Hasbro have risen 56% over the past 12 months, while shares of rival Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) have plunged 34%. Last quarter, Hasbro's sales rose 5% annually on a constant currency basis, while Mattel's slipped 1%. Hasbro's net income improved 25%, but Mattel posted a net loss.
The reason for that disparity is simple -- Hasbro licenses hot franchises based on blockbuster films, while a large portion of Mattel's revenue comes from Barbie, an aging franchise which has lost its appeal with young girls. Last quarter, Hasbro posted 1% annual sales growth at its boys category, which accounted for 43% of its top line, thanks to strong demand for Jurassic World, Marvel, and Star Wars toys. The Jurassic World effect also lifted sales of its preschool products by 14% to claim 15% of Hasbro's total sales.

The main sore spot for Hasbro was its girls' business, which accounted for 16% of its revenue. Sales slipped 22% annually due to lower demand for My Little Pony, Furby, and Nerf Rebelle products. 
Meanwhile, Mattel is more exposed than Hasbro to girls' brands. Last quarter, sales of Barbie and its ""other girls"" brands respectively declined 11% and 6% annually on a constant currency basis. Together, those two categories accounted for over half of its top line. Mattel's sole bright spot had been its exclusive right to manufacture Disney's (NYSE:DIS) popular Frozen dolls. Unfortunately, Hasbro was also granted the right to sell Disney princess dolls, including the Frozen characters, starting in 2016. 
Therefore, if you're looking for a toymaker which can profit from upcoming Marvel, Star Wars, and Disney films, Hasbro fits the bill perfectly.
Electronic ArtsMoving on from toys, let's check in on Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), one of the largest game publishers in the world. Last quarter, EA's revenue rose 5.5% annually as net income improved 7.6%. By comparison, rival Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) revenue rose 15% annually as net income climbed 34.5% last quarter. Activision looks like a better growth play, but EA is a more stable investment for three key reasons -- digital strength, diversification, and mobile growth.
52% of EA's revenue came from higher-margin digital platforms last quarter, versus 44% a year earlier. By comparison, 45% of Activision's revenue came from digital sales last quarter. EA's gaming portfolio is well-diversified across multiple genres, including sports games, shooters like Battlefield Hardline, RPGs like Dragon Age: Inquisition, licensed Star Wars games, and mobile titles. By comparison, Activision still relies heavily on three aging franchises -- World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Skylanders.

Looking ahead, EA's most eagerly anticipated game is Star Wars: Battlefront, an online role playing game which will launch in November to coincide with the Disney's release of Star Wars: Episode VII in December. If Battlefront is a hit, it could lure users away from other online RPGs like World of Warcraft.
On mobile devices, EA's revenue rose 18% annually to $136 million as monthly active users hit 165 million, thanks to the strong performance of games like Simpsons: Tapped Out. Activision's mobile revenues, which came from games like Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, only rose 4% annually to $86 million last quarter. This puts EA in a better position to capitalize on rising sales of mobile games, which could double from $17.5 billion in 2013 to $35.4 billion in 2017, according to research firms AppLift and Newzoo.
The verdictLeisure stocks like Hasbro and EA are ""sunny day stocks"" which will do well as long as consumer confidence remains high. However, that exuberance is also pushing both stocks to premium valuations -- Hasbro and EA now respectively trade at 26 and 28 times trailing earnings, compared to the S&P 500's P/E of 21. Therefore, investors should keep an eye on both stocks, but they should also realize that neither one is fundamentally cheap.

            ","Interest in 2015's E3 conference was massive. Streaming service Twitch said that the show attracted 21 million viewers to its site last month, up from 12 million in 2014. And the conference set records on social media as well, with 6 million Twitter posts and 8 million Instagram likes according to the Entertainment Software Association.
Taking E3's popularity as a proxy for video game demand gives us one more reason to believe publishers are in for a huge 2015. Here are a couple more: The release lineup is stacked, next-gen console installed bases are huge, and digital sales are boosting profit margins to the stratosphere. It's no wonder Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) stocks are both sitting at all-time highs. But which one is the better bet for investors right now?
Electronic Arts EA has momentum on its side. Its profitability leapt past 71% of sales this year, up from 63% in 2012. Operating cash flow has more than quadrupled since 2012 to $1 billion a year. 
But management thinks that's just the start. ""The digital transformation sweeping the whole industry is still in its infancy,"" Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen recently told investors. This tectonic shift provides a chance to ""grow margins by increasing the proportion of full game downloads, by providing extra content for games, and by taking our IP to mobile platforms,"" he predicted.

EA's upcoming release calendar is strong, and it starts with new entries in the blockbuster Madden, NHL, and FIFA franchises. But most of the excitement -- for gamers and investors -- centers around the Star Wars: Battlefront game set for release in November. This shooter attracted huge interest at E3, where executives stressed the game's fidelity to the epic Star Wars franchise. ""You can fly X-wings, TIE fighters, and the Millennium Falcon,"" producer Sigurlina Ingvarsdottir told the crowd. Battlefront could sell as many as 14 million copies, launching a bona fide new AAA franchise for EA in the process. 
Activision BlizzardIn contrast, Activision Blizzard is coming off a year in which two of its biggest brands, World of Warcraft and Call of Duty, registered sales declines. Yet the publisher made huge strides in diversifying its portfolio. With help from the likes of Hearthstone and Destiny, it now counts 10 leading franchises in its quiver, up from 5 last year.
And it's not as if Activision's business is struggling. Call of Duty's Advanced Warfare was yet again the top-selling video game of the year as Skylanders kicked in massive software and toy profits. The company booked record earnings last year as digital revenue pushed past 50% of sales.
The next year is all about expanding into new genres, business model, and markets for this publisher. Call of Duty Online is ramping up in China, while Guitar Hero will join Hearthstone to attack the massive market for casual gameplay on smartphones and tablets.

The most anticipated game in the lineup is of course Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. That title adds several innovations aimed at keeping the franchise fresh and on top of the sales charts as it enters its twelfth year. There's the zombie mode, for example, that promises to boost engagement and digital sales. 
ValuationThe two stock valuations have switched places lately, with EA's jumping to over 5 times sales from a low of 1 times sales just three years ago. In contrast, investors can snap up Activision for 4 times trailing revenue, a slight discount to last year's price.

Wall Street seems to be betting on a home run for EA with Star Wars. And the title's strong reception at E3, along with hefty preorder sales, suggests that's likely. But investors who prefer to own a more diversified software lineup at a cheaper price should consider Activision Blizzard.

It will be another four months before Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) releases its ""Star Wars: Battlefront"" game. But video game fans are already committing to the title in droves. The deluxe edition ranks No. 15 on Amazon's best-selling games list, ahead of currently available hits such as Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) ""Advanced Warfare"" or Ubisoft's ""Watch Dogs. Battlefront"" retails for a steep $70, which also happens to be the price of EA's shares at the moment.
But investors might want to buy the stock instead of the game if they have to pick only one. That purchase could earn them a tidy 14% profit.
The upgrade Despite a 100% rise over the last year, EA just won a new fan on Wall Street. UBS analyst Eric Sheridan upgraded the stock to ""buy"" this week while boosting his price target from $65 to $80. Sheridan's optimism centers around the ""Battlefront"" game, which he thinks will sell as many as 14 million copies, or 40% above management's forecast. 
After all, the title just cleaned up at this year's E3 conference, collecting hefty awards, including ""Best Action Game"" and ""Best Online Multiplayer."" Preorder sales through Amazon seem strong, and they'll likely receive heavy promotion by retailer GameStop this summer and fall.
And if ""Battlefront"" does meet strong gamer demand, investors can expect substantial profit growth to follow. That's mostly thanks to the positive role that digital sales are playing in EA's business right now. The channel has spiked to $2.2 billion annually, up from $1.7 billion just two years ago. The biggest piece of that growth is from consoles, where EA can market add-on content and full game downloads.
Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen recently explained to investors how that revenue supercharges EA's results:
The [add-on content] part of our business is growing dramatically. It not only extends the life of the game, but it also allows us to gain additional revenue on that life over time. And we find that what that also does is allows us to lower the cost of marketing to the next customer, because you're not paying a lot to reacquire someone; the customer is already playing.
Digital sales are the driving factor behind EA's huge profitability improvement. Gross profit is up to almost 70% of sales, pushing it past rival Activision Blizzard.

EA Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.
The payoff Those improving economics are why Sheridan thinks EA can book $3.01 per share in profit this year. That estimate is significantly higher than Wall Street's collective judgment: The 21 analysts who cover the stock see earnings coming in at $2.85 per share. EA's management, meanwhile, is targeting just $2.75 per share for the year.

Still, UBS's stock price target seems reasonable. If the stock rose to $80 per share, it would be valued at 27 times that $3 profit figure. The current P/E valuation is 26 times, so we're not talking about a huge move. 
It's never a good idea to bet on one title changing the fortunes of a video game publisher. After all, Take-Two recently managed the single biggest sales result ever for an entertainment property launch with ""GTA V,"" yet the stock underperformed both EA and Activision. 
Also, it's possible that ""Battlefront"" will stumble out of the gate, especially given all the build-up. A lot depends on how the game works once it gets into players' hands. EA had to eat crow for some recent glitchy releases, including ""severely fumbling"" the launch of ""SimCity"" in 2013. That kind of slip-up could always happen again.
Still, I think the upcoming ""Battlefield"" launch is a great extra reason to like EA's business in addition to, say, the 9 percentage point gross profit margin improvement since 2012. For my money, though, I still like Activision Blizzard as the better video game stock value at the moment.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) made a number of notable announcements at E3 this year. The video game giant unveiled several new titles and showed off many of its upcoming releases. Below are three key takeaways from its press conference.
New games are comingAs a video game publisher, Electronic Arts' financial results depend entirely on its ability to release compelling new titles. The company spent most of E3 detailing its upcoming pipeline, the majority of which are slated to debut this year or in 2016.
Unsurprisingly, its sports franchises (FIFA, Madden, NBA Live, and NHL) will receive their regular annual installments this year with updated graphics and improved features. The company also plans to release an expansion pack to its massive multiplayer online game, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and a new entry in its racing series, Need for Speed. 
For 2016, Electronic Arts is scheduled to release a sequel to Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare, an online, team-based third-person shooter with a cartoon aesthetic. It will also release the fourth entry in its long-running sci-fi RPG series Mass Effect, along with a sequel to the 2008 action game Mirror's Edge. The company also plans to publish puzzle platformer, Unravel, what appears to be low-budget title, one unlikely to have much of an effect on earnings. However, it is a noticeable departure from Electronic Arts' traditional offerings.

Star Wars: Battlefront looks impressiveThe most important game in this lineup might be Star Wars: Battlefront. The Star Wars-themed first-person shooter is due to launch on Nov. 17th, just weeks before the release of the next feature film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Of all the upcoming titles, this seems most likely to provide a significant boost to the bottom line.
Electronic Arts announced the game several months ago but used E3 to show actual gameplay footage for the first time. Reviews for the game will not show up until just before its launch, but if the E3 presentation was any indication, the game looks spectacular.

Electronic Arts has said its current guidance is based on sales projections of nine million to 10 million copies. That estimate is based on previous Battlefront games (the last of which was released a decade ago) and Electronic Arts' long-running Battlefield series of first-person shooters. Battlefront is being developed by the same studio that produced Battlefield, and the similarities should be obvious to anyone who has played those games. Given the growing mania surrounding the reemergence of Star Wars (the first teaser trailer for Episode 7 has been viewed more than 69 million times on YouTube) management guidance could prove conservative.
Wading into the collectible card game genreElectronic Arts derives the majority of its sales from traditional gaming platforms -- consoles and  PCs -- but mobile gaming is growing rapidly, and Electronic Arts is an active participant. Last quarter, mobile brought in about 13% of adjusted net revenue. In time, it could be much more: Research firm eMarketer expects the market for mobile games in the U.S. to rise 16.5% in 2015.
The company did not spend much time discussing its mobile initiatives but did announce one new title -- Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, a collectible card game.
Without too many specifics, it is difficult to judge just how big Galaxy of Heroes could be. But it seems remarkably similar to Hearthstone, a collectible card game rival Activison Blizzard launched on mobile devices last year. Hearthstone has been something of a surprise success for Activision. As of May, Hearthstone, along with newcomer Destiny, had generated a combined $1 billion in adjusted revenue.
Gamers might not take to Galaxy of Heroes with the same enthusiasm, but if they do, it could become an unexpected source of upside in the quarters to come.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) continues its impressive run.
Shares of the video game publisher rose on Tuesday, after the company turned in a fiscal fourth quarter earnings report that greatly exceeded expectations. Electronic Arts' business appears to be firing on all cylinders, as demand for its games continues to surge in the face of strong next-generation console adoption.
During its subsequent earnings call, Electronic Arts' management, including CEO Andrew Wilson and CFO Blake Jorgensen, offered a number of key insights into the company's business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that call.
On Electronic Arts' upcoming slate of gamesAs a major video game publisher, Electronic Arts' business is entirely beholden to the popularity of its games. A major title can generate the bulk of its performance in a key quarter, while a disappointment could lead to an earnings miss. Early in the call, Wilson offered investors a quick rundown of Electronic Arts' plans for new games in the coming fiscal year.
In addition to Star Wars: Battlefront ... the latest releases of Rory McIlroy: PGA Tour, Madden NFL, FIFA, NHL, and NBA Live ... FY 2016 will see the return of Need for Speed as we introduce a new console experience as well as a new mobile game. Maxis will continue to deliver great new content for The Sims 4, including another expansion pack, multiple game packs, and additional game updates for the growing Sims 4 player community ... we will be returning to the Plants vs. Zombies universe with a bigger and bolder new console experience ... Minions Paradise ... will be one of at least five new EA Mobile titles this year. In spring 2016, Mirror's Edge is set to revolutionize the action-adventure genre with its stunning first-person gameplay.
Margins are improvingAs a business, Electronic Arts' underlying performance is improving. Two years ago, Electronic Arts' management made a commitment to double adjusted operating margins to 20%, but managed to surpass that guidance a year ahead of schedule. During the call, Jorgensen noted and explained Electronic Arts' rapid improvement.
When we first started talking about improving the performance of Electronic Arts, I suggested it would take three years to double our non-GAAP operating margins from 10% to 20%. We've exceeded that in two years. In fact, at nearly 25%, our fiscal 2015 operating margin is over 500 basis points above our guidance at the beginning of the year and at its highest point in over a decade. We've dramatically increased our efficiency. Non-GAAP operating expenses are down a full 10 percentage points, from 56% of net revenue in FY 2013 to just 46% in FY 2015.
The digital shift continuesElectronic Arts has been a vocal proponent of the ongoing shift toward digital distribution. While physical game discs still compose the bulk of games Electronic Arts sells on major consoles, it may not be that way for much longer. During the call, COO Peter Moore noted the trends Electronic Arts is seeing in its business.
Our full-game downloads that you're seeing, they do vary from title and by geography. But the latest data we've got shows us at a 20%+ for Battlefield Hardline, and that's up from about 13% to 15% this time last year for our AAA title releases. So we're seeing the growth.
Expectations for Star WarsAlthough Electronic Arts has many games scheduled for its upcoming fiscal year, in terms of importance, one title in particular is likely to stand above the rest. Star Wars: Battlefront, its upcoming first-person shooter, is scheduled to debut in November, just a month before the release of the next Star Wars film. During the call, Jorgensen gave Electronic Arts' expectations for the games, likening it to past Battlefront games and Electronic Arts' other first-person shooters.
We're thinking about [Battlefront] with two bookends. One bookend is the historical Battlefront, which did roughly 9 million units. The other bookend is our core first-person shooter franchise of Battlefield, which typically does around 15 million units. So I think in our guidance, we've roughly put in there roughly 9 million to 10 million units for the title, with we believe some upside obviously if things goes well. It is [Xbox One and PlayStation 4]-only and PC, and so that needs to get factored into people's thinking, but it is a very exciting title.
A possible delay?Electronic Arts has delayed several of its key games in recent months, including most recently, Battlefield: Hardline. The delays don't seem to have had much of an effect on Electronic Arts' performance, as the extra development time may have ensured a better product. But that likely won't be true for Star Wars: Battlefront. A key element to the game's success could be its timing in relation to the debut of Star Wars in theaters. If Battlefront is delayed -- perhaps pushed out to January or February of 2016 -- some of the buzz could die down, and sales could disappoint. During the call, Wilson touched on this topic, noting that anything is possible, but the company is currently very committed to launching Battlefront in November.
With that said, there are any number of things that might contribute to a miss or a need to move a date. As it relates to Star Wars: Battlefront, I would say as it stands right now, we feel very, very good about the trajectory and the velocity of the development team.

            ","Back in 2012, it was estimated that the U.S. video game industry grew four times faster than the U.S. economy from 2009 through 2012 by the Entertainment Software Association. Looking ahead, research firm DFC Intelligence estimates that worldwide game sales will soar from $63 billion in 2014 to $100 billion by 2018.

However, the video game industry can be tough for new investors to understand. Many gaming companies are overly dependent on blockbuster franchises. Accelerated release schedules cause studios to launch games before they're ready, resulting in franchise-killing flops. In-app purchases and downloadable content can turn some games into ""pay-to-win"" affairs. 
Therefore, let's take a look at two types of video game companies -- reliable core holdings and volatile mobile plays -- to see which types of gaming companies suit your investing style.
Core stocks: EA and Activision BlizzardGame publishing giants Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) are solid core holdings for any video game centered portfolio.
Electronic Arts had a rough run over the past few years. The Consumerist named EA the worst company in America in 2012 and 2013, following botched, bug-ridden launches of flagship games like SimCity and Battlefield 4. 

Battlefield 4 represented a low point in EA's history. Source: EA.
Under new CEO Andrew Wilson, who replaced John Riccitiello in 2013, EA delayed titles rather than rush them into a holiday release (such as Battlefield Hardline) and streamlined its mobile business. As a result, EA's non-GAAP revenue improved 6% annually in 2014 as net income more than doubled. Mobile revenue hit $460 million in 2014, up from $104 million in 2013, thanks to the success of its mobile sports games and tie-in games with console titles.
Activision Blizzard's top line is highly dependent on aging franchises like Call of Duty, Skylanders, and World of Warcraft. As a result, Activision's stock price is often weighed down by weakening Call of Duty sales or slumping World of Warcraft subscriber numbers. However, Activision has steadily diversified its top line with new IPs like Destiny. In 2014, Activision's non-GAAP revenues rose 11% as earnings rose higher than 50%. However, revenue at Activision's mobile unit, which accounted for 12% of its top line, fell 29% year-over-year as its mobile games failed to impress.
On a fundamental basis, Activision stock is cheaper at 20 times earnings, compared to EA's P/E of 22. However, EA stock also rallied 103% over the past 12 months, compared to Activision's 16% gain.
Speculative stocks: Zynga, King, and Glu MobileMobile gaming stocks are more speculative investments than heavyweight publishers like EA and Activision. Let's take a look at three such stocks: Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), King Digital Entertainment (NYSE:KING), and Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:GLUU).
Zynga's two top games are Farmville 2 and Zynga Poker, which together generated 43% of its revenue last quarter. 40% of Glu's revenue came from its chart-topping hit, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood last quarter. King's top franchise is Candy Crush Saga, which accounted for 45% of the company's ""gross bookings"" last quarter. 
Both Zynga and King often refer to gross bookings, or total purchases of virtual products (like energy packs), instead of revenue. Those purchases are initially reported as deferred revenue and recognized as bookings over the estimated time that it takes to ""consume"" the virtual product.

King's Candy Crush Saga could give your portfolio cavities.
There are a few notable problems with this business model. First, any slowdown in top grossing games will cause their stocks to slide. The companies must then develop and market new games to offset those losses, but doing so can cause operating expenses to spike. 
Most mobile game makers generate revenue from a ""freemium"" model. However, 60% of those revenues across the industry come from just 0.23% of all players, according to mobile marketing firm Swrve. This means that all three companies rely heavily on so-called ""whales"" to keep buying virtual goods as the majority of gamers play for free. As we can see from Zynga, King, and Glu's top and bottom line numbers for 2014, that top-heavy business model yields mixed results.

Do your due diligence, dear investor ...We've merely covered the basics of investing in video games in this article, but investors should first understand the difference between time-tested gaming stocks like EA and Activision and speculative plays like King. Moreover, investors should do their due diligence and understand the weight of various franchises on these companies' top lines, and which upcoming games will serve as catalysts for the stock.

Want to know what the best stocks are in the video gaming industry? You’re not alone. The gaming industry has delivered fantastic returns in recent years, and make no mistake, the trend toward widespread video game usage means the outlook for game stocks is still strong. Given this self-evident trend, you might be looking for game stocks to include in your portfolio. It's not easy but thorough analysis will always yield the best stocks to buy today as long as one has a long term perspective.

Investors looking to get exposure to this industry have a variety of options, but Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) are three of the best companies in the space.
Electronic Arts was one of the single best performing tech stocks in 2014. Shares of the publisher more than doubled, as sales of several of its key titles, including Titanfall and Dragon Age: Inquisition, exceeded expectations. That surge has given Electronic Arts a more aggressive valuation than some of its rivals, but the stock could continue to deliver in the quarters to come. 
Among video game publishers, Electronic Arts has what may be the most interesting game for 2015. In November the company will launch Star Wars: Battlefront, a multiplayer first person shooter set in the fictional Star Wars universe. On its own, the game already had the potential to be a top-selling title, but it could be catapulted up the rankings by the fervor surrounding the upcoming film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which will arrive in theaters roughly one month after Battlefront hits store shelves. Electronic Arts released a trailer for the game on Friday, and it looks -- to put it mildly -- stunning.

In addition, Electronic Arts also has its sports franchises (including Madden and FIFA), which continue to be consistent winners. Electronic Arts depends mostly on traditional consoles, but versions of its sports games designed for smartphones and tablets have helped propel its mobile revenue, which rose 26% year-over-year last quarter.
Activision Blizzard has fewer franchises than Electronic Arts, but the titles it does release are almost always massively successful. Activision has several billion-dollar franchises and household names under its belt, including World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Skylanders.
The latter two will receive new entries later this year, along with a new title in the Guitar Hero series. Destiny -- which is developed by Bungie but published by Activision -- will be supported with a series of digital expansions. Destiny was something of a drain on Activison shares last fall after reviewers panned the title, but it ultimately went on to become the best-selling game in a new series ever.
Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, has been expanding to new platforms in recent months. Last week, it arrived on Android and the iPhone for the first time. Hearthstone is a free-to-play mobile game, but it is aimed more at gaming enthusiasts than casual players. Since its release last year, Activision has continued to support the game with a series of expansions, and its revenue has grown from month to month. When Activision last reported earnings, it noted that Hearthstone set a record for monthly revenue in December.
Longer-term, Activision has two new titles planned, Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm, and could reap long-term financial rewards from Call of Duty: Online, a free-to-play version of its massively popular shooter currently exclusive to China.
Take-Two is a much smaller company than both Electronic Arts and Activision, but it has one of the largest franchises in gaming: Grand Theft Auto. The latest installment, Grand Theft Auto V, originally released in 2013, has become one of the best selling games in history, moving more than 45 million units as of the end of last quarter.
Unlike its competitors, Take-Two has been reluctant to turn Grand Theft Auto into an annual series, instead releasing a new entry every four to five years. But in the meantime, Take-Two has been able to monetize Grand Theft Auto through Grand Theft Auto Online, a separate, online version of the game that includes the ability to purchase in-game currency with real money.
Of course, Take-Two is more than just Grand Theft Auto. It has two sports series -- NBA2K and WWE -- that should receive entries this year. In addition, Red Dead Redemption, a game Take-Two released in 2010 to both great critical and commercial success, could be about to get a sequel. It is not confirmed, but the company has been hinting at its development.

            ","When it comes to your Roth IRA, a good strategy is to aim for holdings that will grow briskly. That's because the money earned in a Roth IRA can be withdrawn tax-free. Thus, it's smart to park at least some stocks in your Roth IRA that have the potential to be big long-term winners.
Here are three compelling candidates:
Image: Electronic Arts.
Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA)Electronic Arts is a powerhouse in the booming and profitable world of video games. It struggled in recent years, but CEO Andrew Wilson has been turning things around in a big way, with the stock more than doubling over the past year. And with its recent and forward-looking P/E ratios only in the low 20s, it's still not grossly overvalued.
Electronic Arts is generating about a billion dollars annually in free cash flow. Gross margins have been rising over the past few years, and net margins recently approached a hefty 20%. Part of the reason for the margin growth is a big push into subscription-based gaming, via its EA Access program, giving subscribers access to older titles. The industrywide move toward digital downloads of games is also boosting profits, as games no longer have to be printed, packaged, and stocked on shelves.
Other catalysts for the business include the relatively new Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles, which will boost demand for new games, and the company's push into mobile gaming, which is projected to generate $21 billion industrywide this year, with digital gamers spending a third of their dollars on mobile games. Mobile games are expected by some to hit $60 billion by 2017. Another promising catalyst is the upcoming Star Wars: Battlefront game, which will make its debut late in the year, along with the latest Star Wars movie.
Meanwhile, the company still has its strong franchises of Madden NFL, Battlefield, and FIFA -- and mobile successes with SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile, and FIFA Ultimate Team. For its third quarter, the company posted revenue up 39% year over year, and more than 160 million monthly active users for its mobile games. The company certainly seems to have more room to run.
Image: Priceline Group.
Priceline Group Inc. (NASDAQ:PCLN)Priceline Group Inc was once known for its name-your-own-price airfare deals, but it's grown into an online travel juggernaut, having gobbled up Booking.com, Kayak.com, and OpenTable, among other successful businesses. It now offers discounted booking for airfares, hotels, car rentals, and vacation packages -- and now bookings for restaurants, too. Another recent acquisition is Rocketmiles, which will give Priceline an appealing loyalty program, via the ability to offer airline miles as rewards with bookings, boosting its appeal and competitiveness.
Past performance doesn't guarantee future success, but based on past performance, Priceline seems poised to continue growing significantly in a Roth IRA. Over the past decade, its revenue and earnings, respectively, have averaged annual gains of 25% and 54%. Its gross margins have soared from about 28% to 90% over that span, while net margins have popped from 20% to nearly 29%. In its fourth quarter, gross bookings rose 17% year over year, with earnings per share rising 20%. International bookings grew by 27%, which bodes well for the company's prospects, as much of its growth potential lies abroad. It's also an impressive number considering recent weakness in Europe and China.
Priceline stock seems appealingly priced, too. It has averaged annual growth of 46.5% over the past decade, but is down a smidge over the past year. Its P/E ratio was recently only 26 for such a fast grower, and its forward-looking P/E just 16, well below its five-year average of 30. Management has deemed its stock price attractive enough to get a $3 billion stock buyback program approved, with which to reward shareholders. Priceline might be even more profitable today if it weren't plowing a lot of money into advertising and into its businesses such as OpenTable and BookingsSuite. But such investments today can pay off powerfully tomorrow.
Facebook stock has been on a bit of a tear since it debuted.
Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB)We all know that Facebook is a big growth story. Its revenue and earnings per share, respectively, have averaged annual gains of 50% and 37% over the past three years, while its stock has soared. Yet with a forward-looking P/E ratio near 33, the stock doesn't seem too pricey at recent levels.
To understand the company's great growth potential, you just have to review a few numbers. As of the end of 2014, it had 890 million active daily users -- nearly a billion people -- a level up 18% over the year before. Its mobile active daily users numbered nearly as much, 745 million, up 34% from the year before. Even more intriguing, more than 80% of its active daily users are outside the U.S. and Canada.
Once you appreciate its great reach, think about what Facebook knows about most of us users, and what it can do with that information. It's already making a lot of money from ads on its site -- remember, its service remains free for its billion-some users -- and it's moving into video ads. It can use its data gathered on users to target ads so that they're more likely to be effective. Facebook's advertising revenue soared 65% in 2014, to $11.5 billion, its number of active monthly advertisers hit a whopping 2 million, and it grabbed market share from titan Google. It's impressively effective in advertising, too, managing to significantly reduce its number of ads in 2014's fourth quarter while boosting their average price more than fourfold. Meanwhile, Facebook is even threatening eBay's PayPal unit, adding a payment feature to its Messenger App.
Facebook can also leverage its broad base in others ways, such as by trying to enter the professional networking arena. And with annual free cash flow topping $3.6 billion, it has the ability to buy plenty of promising technologies. It has bought Oculus VR, for example, which offers virtual-reality technology, and the popular WhatsApp app as well. Most recently, Facebook bought TheFind, a personalized e-commerce search service that can strengthen its ability to offer targeted advertising to its users. The company has been a savvy acquirer -- think of Instagram, bought for $1 billion a few years ago and recently worth $35 billion, with some 300 million monthly active users.
Whether you buy these or other companies for your Roth IRA, look for strong and healthy growers, as any exponential growth that occurs in your portfolio will be available to you tax-free in retirement.

            ","People are spending a lot of time playing video games these days. And I do mean a lot. 
Electronic Arts(NASDAQ:EA)saw gameplay hours for Madden NFL 15 jump 30% last quarter as compared to the prior year. And gamers spent an average of three hours per day playing Destiny in the first few months after launch, according to publisher Activision Blizzard(NASDAQ:ATVI).
Those banner engagement figures powered a massive profit spike at both gaming companies. EA managed an all-time high 68% profit margin last quarter, while Activision posted 51% higher earnings -- a record $1.42 per share. But whereas EA shares surged by over 100% in the past year, Activision stock has hardly budged.
So, does that make the owner of the Call of Duty and Skylanders franchises the obvious investment choice from here? Let's compare the two biggest publishers in the video game industry, starting with a few key statistics:
Revenue and sales growth are based on the last complete fiscal year. Profit margin is trailing 12 months. Source: Company filings
Broadly speaking, Activision looks like the cheaper investment. You can buy it at a discount to EA whether you are considering price-to-earnings or price-to-sales multiples. In fact, Activision has EA beat on all of the major metrics except one: profitability.
Electronic Arts is winning the digital warProfitability has been the main driver behind the amazing gains EA shares have enjoyed the past year. Gross profit margin is up from 58% of sales in 2011 to a projected 71% this year. The company even beat its larger rival on this key metric last quarter.

EA Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.
EA managed that feat through a few big wins, including its best yet Dragon Age game launch and solid improvements in the FIFA, Madden, and Sims franchises. But the biggest reason for the profit bounce has been its success with downloadable content sales. 
Digital revenue accounted for a record 49% of sales last quarter, up 35% from the prior year. And on a trailing 12 month basis, those highly profitable digital sales now represent more than half of EA revenue. The trend promises to keep lifting earnings higher in the next few years.
Source: Bungie
Activision Blizzard expands its portfolioActivision is also benefiting from that digital shift: The channel was responsible for 46% of sales in the past year, up 50% from 2013. That is particularly impressive when you consider how much revenue Activision gets from retail toy sales tied to its Skylanders kids franchise. 
But the best reason to like Activision Blizzard right now is its growing portfolio of AAA game brands. At the beginning of 2014, just three franchises, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Sklyanders, accounted for the vast majority of sales and profit. 
But with Destiny and Hearthstone added to the mix last year, and with Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, and Call of Duty Online slated for 2015, the portfolio will be packed with 10 blockbuster franchises by the end of this year.  
Foolish wrapWhile both businesses are performing well, I believe Activision Blizzard is the better investment. Yes, EA profitability should march higher, particularly as it rings the register on the recent Battlefield: Hardline release. However, those profit gains seem to be reflected in a stock that is now valued at 23 times trailing earnings, up from 17 times just three months ago.
The valuation gap alone suggests that Activision will outperform its smaller publishing rival over the next five years. Investors now have two great choices if they want diverse exposure to the surging video game market. But they can get that exposure at a comparative steal through Activision.

            ","It took George Lucas nearly thirty years to release six Star Wars films -- Disney could accomplish that feat in less than a decade.
Beginning this December with The Force Awakens, theater-goers are about to be inundated with a wave of Star Wars films -- not just mainline entries, but also side stories and spin-offs. Assuming they're as popular as the Star Wars movies that captivated audiences in years past, they should propel the shares of a wide variety of businesses beyond Disney (NYSE:DIS) itself.
Below are three less obvious stocks that could get a boost from Star Wars' return.
AMC should benefit from strong attendanceWith 348 locations and nearly 5,000 screens, AMC Holdings (NYSE:AMC) is one of the top movie theater chains in the United States. Its business is entirely dependent on the American public's interest in films -- and Star Wars should provide a nice jolt.
AMC has suffered from declining attendance figures in recent quarters -- an industrywide trend. To some extent, this may be to due to shifts in the broader competitive landscape: more appealing entertainment options and Internet streaming services have taken some of the allure out of theater attendance. But in its most recent earnings call, AMC blamed a weak film slate for its ticket sales, noting that it was the mercy of Hollywood to provide it with interesting films.
Star Wars should provide those films, drawing crowds of patrons to AMC's theaters in the years ahead. There are other publicly traded movie theater chains, but AMC may be the best bet, as its management has been able to persevere and even outperform the industry. Last quarter, AMC's admissions revenues per screen rose 13.8% -- much better than the 4.3% industrywide contraction.
Special effects best seen on an IMAX screenMany of those theater-goers could choose to see Star Wars on an IMAX (NYSE:IMAX) screen. If so, it should benefit that namesake company.
The high-end theater provider has been a frequent target of short-sellers in recent months: nearly one-fifth of its shares have been bet against. IMAX's business depends on the demand for its IMAX-branded screens, and with theater attendance in decline, the market for IMAX's systems could come under pressure.
IMAX has proven its critics wrong, rallying more than 20% over the last 12 months, but shares could rally further still as a wave of Star Wars films juices the demand for its systems. Star Wars films, perhaps more so than any other, depend on cutting-edge visuals and special effects, and watching them on an IMAX screen may offer a much better experience.
Electronic Arts' Star Wars-themed games should get more attentionVideo game giant Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) won't make any money from theater attendance -- at least not directly -- but consumers swept up in Star Wars mania could find themselves turning to Electronic Arts' upcoming slate of Star Wars-themed video games.
In 2013, Disney signed an exclusive pact with Electronic Arts to develop Star Wars games aimed at ""core audiences"" -- gamers that play on the Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. The first of these games, Star Wars: Battlefront, will debut later this year in conjunction with the release of The Force Awakens, and more should be forthcoming.
If the games are poorly made, they may not sell well, but the use of the Star Wars' intellectual property should at least attract the attention of gamers, many of whom are likely to be Star Wars fans.

            ","Gaming stocks have done very well over the past year. Third-party publishers have benefited from the introduction of new consoles from Sony and Microsoft as well as increasing digital sales, and these tailwinds helped every third-party console game publisher except for Ubisoft beat the market over the last 12 months. While Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive both posted solid gains, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) performed best of all, nearly doubling over the period.
The company's incredible stock gains have pushed its forward P/E ratio to roughly 28. Using this metric, EA stands as the priciest of the third-party games publishers. Yet, with a strong position in a growing industry and apparent improvement in the company's operations, Electronic Arts is also the most expensive stock worth buying in the realm of gaming companies.
Surveying the fieldElectronic Arts develops and publishes hit franchises like FIFA, Madden NFL, and Battlefield, and has ridden strong software performance to gains of roughly 93% over the last year. The company has also posted the best growth of any gaming company in the last five years, delivering gains of roughly 217% while the S&P 500 increased roughly 82%. Across the same stretch, Activision, Take Two, and Ubisoft made gains of 109%, 136%, and 46%, respectively. Surveying the competition: Activision Blizzard looks solid even as the Call of Duty series is losing some of its pull, Take Two seems to be building a stronger lineup on top of the megahit Grand Theft Auto series, while Ubisoft is looking a bit weak due to declining performance from its Assassin's Creed property.
EA is winning the digital distribution gameAlso key to Electronic Arts' growth is the advancement of its mobile presence and booming digital software sales. Selling games digitally rather than through retailers like GameStop is enabling the company to improve its margins and drive revenues through direct-to-consumer promotions. This has helped the company deliver results for its last four quarters that were significantly better than the average analyst estimate, and each earnings release prompted a significant stock bump. For the company's fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014, roughly 45% of the company's revenue came from digital sales. This impressive figure was partially propelled by a 47% year-over-year increase in the sale of downloadable content for games.
EA looks to have room to further improve its margins as digital distribution continues to make gains at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailers. The company's EA Access program functions as a year-long subscription to previously released games from some of its big series at a relatively low price of $30, and the company has indicated that the package has been quite successful. These types of direct-to-consumer promotions help the publisher to absorb revenue that might have otherwise been generated from used copies of its games.
Big franchises, mobile growth, and beyondElectronic Arts seems primed for more strong performance in the year to come, with new installments in some of the company's biggest franchises set to release, as well as the revival of the Star Wars: Battlefont series. The company should continue to benefit from the expanding user base for the new gaming consoles, as well as the ongoing growth in digital sales. It also has a major growth opportunity in mobile.
Research firm Digi-Capital estimates that mobile gaming will grow at a 23% compound aggregate growth rate, and hit $60 billion in sales by 2017, with the total gaming industry being worth $100 billion. Electronic Arts has a solid stable of franchises that it can use to ride this wave, a crucial asset because recognizable brands are often necessary to stand out in the crowded mobile software landscape. The company recently scored mobile hits with SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile, and FIFA Ultimate Team, and it looks like these properties are primed for continued gains.
With strong footing in console and mobile gaming, and great momentum in digital content distribution, EA is well-diversified across its industry. There has even been talk that the games publisher will team with Comcast to stream games through the cable-provider's X1 cable box. Even though Electronic Arts is priced for growth, there's plenty of evidence it can deliver. EA stands as the most expensive stock making games worth buying.

            ","Apple stock has been on an incredible run over the last year. Shares have increased roughly 67% in a 12-month span, with total returns coming in at a fantastic 70%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has gained roughly 12% over the period.
Apple stock currently trades near all-time highs, and the company has set a new record for highest market cap in history. But as great as the iPhone maker's performance has been, it isn't the only stock that's been crushing the market. We asked three Fool contributors to spotlight a company that has delivered even greater returns than Apple within the last year. Read on to learn about these massive market beaters.
Dan Caplinger (Skyworks Solutions): Apple has been a huge performer over the past year, but the company has grown so large that it's hard for even its massive results quarter after quarter to move the needle as much as smaller companies can experience. One great example of that phenomenon comes from Apple supplier Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), which has ridden the coattails of various tech giants to its own great success.
It's true that Skyworks owes some of its success to Apple. But the nearly 150% returns that the stock has posted in the past year aren't due entirely to the Cupertino-based tech giant. Indeed, one of the areas that Skyworks believes could help it grow the fastest involves the rising popularity of wireless communication generally. For high-end operations, Skyworks hopes to help support high-bandwidth uses like streaming video and music through its customized signal-filtering and tuning solutions. Meanwhile, other uses like navigation and power-management offer different but equally promising chances for Skyworks to broaden its business reach. With the rise of the Internet of Things, mobile payments, and on-demand entertainment, Skyworks doesn't have to labor entirely in Apple's shadow, and with plenty of runway left ahead, Skyworks could easily keep outpacing Apple's returns in 2015 and beyond.
Joe Tenebruso (Electronic Arts): Few large-cap companies have outperformed Apple over the last year. Yet surprisingly, what was once deemed ""The Worst Company in America"" has done just that.
After struggling for years with stagnating game franchises and a poor reputation among gamers, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) appears to have righted the ship. The long-beleaguered video game maker turned in an impressive 2014 and has risen more than 90% in the last 12 months, compared to Apple's nearly 70% returns.
Fueled by the launch of new game consoles like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, EA's trailing-12-month revenue surged 22% over the prior-year period. And thanks in part to a major shift toward higher-margin digital revenue -- which now comprises more than half of EA's total revenue-- adjusted earnings rose an even more impressive 51% during that time.
New CEO Andrew Wilson is taking steps to restore Electronics Arts' image among gamers by delivering high-quality new games such as the critically acclaimed Dragon Age: Inquisition, as well as popular new services such as EA Access, where gamers can subscribe to digital access to EA's older titles. These initiatives, along with consistently strong operational performance throughout 2014, have even led my Foolish colleague Sam Mattera to name Wilson the best tech CEO of 2014.
Keith Noonan (Ambarella): Growing demand for wearables and security cameras has propelled chipmaker Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) to incredible gains over the last year. The company is a small-cap stock with a market cap of around $2 billion, and its stock is prone to big swings, but shares have gained roughly 85% over the last 12 months and it looks like the company is poised to continue delivering wins for investors. Ambarella supplies image and video processing chips for devices such as GoPro cameras, and recently delivered great results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year. Sales for the annual term were up 38.5% over the prior year, and earnings per diluted share grew nearly 85%.
With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 40, Ambarella is priced for sustained growth and well above Apple's forward P/E of roughly 15, but the semiconductor company appears to be in shape to deliver. It anticipates that annual revenue will increase between 27% and 30% this year, along with improved operating margins, and there are reasons to believe the chipmaker's growth story is just getting started. Business is picking up in China and South Korea, and Ambarella is diversifying its customer base with wins in Xiaomi's upcoming low-cost action camera and the emerging drone market.
Security and automotive cameras also look poised for growth, and Ambarella's expertise in low-power, high-performance video chips will enable it to benefit from the rise of the Internet of Things. The stock could be a great pick for investors who are looking to capitalize on momentum in cameras but find individual camera makers like GoPro too risky.

            ","2014 was a solid year for the markets: the S&P 500 finished with an 11% gain. But a few tech stocks turned in even better performances. In particular, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) trounced the market, soaring in 2014.
Is it time to take profits in these tech stock winners? Or should investors in these stocks consider holding? Below, three Motley Fool contributors offer their takes on some of last year's best performers.
Bob Ciura (Facebook): Facebook continued to be a huge winner for investors last year. The stock gained more than 40% in 2014, which handily beat the broader market yet again. This continued a longer-term trend of strong outperformance since Facebook's initial public offering. Facebook's share price has doubled since its May 2012 IPO, as its key metrics -- revenue, active users, and profits -- have all racked up strong growth. Indeed, last year Facebook grew revenue and earnings per share by 58% and 83%, respectively, as monthly active users reached 1.39 billion.
But at some point, investors need to consider Facebook's valuation. The stock trades for 70 times 2014 GAAP diluted earnings, which is a significant concern. So far, investors seem too willing to brush aside Facebook's valuation, but that can be dangerous thinking. When discussing valuation as it pertains to social media stocks, some argue that valuation doesn't really matter for growth stocks. Instead, these companies will grow fast enough to justify their lofty valuations. And many times, that's absolutely true. However, there comes a point Facebook can't keep growing at accelerating rates.
Facebook is now a $214 billion company by market capitalization. This is an enormous company. Investors buying in at these levels are at risk of poor future returns, if and when Facebook's tantalizing growth finally begins to slow down. Even great companies can be bad investments in cases of overvaluation. Investors may want to take some of their Facebook profits off the table.
Tamara Walsh (Apple): The tech giant was a high flyer last year, with its stock gaining nearly 79% compared to just a 14% gain by the S&P 500 over the same period. Apple has enjoyed such a momentous run, in fact, that it is now worth more than the entire S&P 600 small-cap index. And with a market cap north of $755 billion today, Apple is not only the most valuable company in history, but it is also worth more than double any other publicly traded company on the market today.
Nevertheless, with shares of Apple currently trading near record highs at around $130 apiece, many investors worry there could be a correction on the horizon. For starters, there's a lot of pressure building around the tech titan's upcoming Apple Watch launch, which is set to hit the market in April. The company is planning a media event on March 9 that many speculate is related to the anticipated debut of its first truly wearable device. Yet, if Apple's upcoming iWatch isn't a hit with consumers it could bolster concerns that Apple is losing its innovative edge -- a reality that would likely crush the stock in its wake.
However, the stock's stratospheric surge and future execution risks are hardy reason enough to sell this tech stock superstar. Even if Apple's iWatch is a flop, the company has enough liquid assets and cash on hand to offset any related losses. Not to mention, Apple will continue to reward current shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Apple, for example, spent more than $56 billion last year on dividends and share repurchases, and analysts at Credit Suisse believe Apple will raise its capital return plan to $202 billion by 2017, according to the Financial Times.
Therefore, even at all time highs, Apple is one tech stock winner that investors should own for many more years to come.
Sam Mattera (Electronic Arts): Video game publisher Electronic Arts was one of the single best performing stocks in the market last year. Boosted by the launch of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, Electronic Arts shares doubled in 2014, and have continued to rally in 2015.
Electronic Arts isn't the bargain it was a year ago, but it may not be time to take profits just yet. The console cycle that benefited Electronic Arts remains in its infancy -- the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 have been on the market only a fraction as long as their predecessors. As more gamers adopt these platforms, Electronic Arts will gain more potential customers for its upcoming titles. Electronic Arts faces a lot of competition, but may be the most innovative major publisher. Last July, it launched EA Access, a first of its kind subscription service that allows it to monetize older content.
Led by its new CEO, Andrew Wilson, Electronic Arts is slowly turning around its poor image, and releasing higher quality games. Later this month, it will launch Battlefield: Hardline, and in December, it will benefit from the return of Star Wars with Star Wars: Battlefront.

            ","Star Wars: The Force Awakens will open in theaters on Dec 18.
Sometime around then -- perhaps a week or two before -- Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) will launch Star Wars: Battlefront, a first-person shooter video game set in the Star Wars universe. Battlefront is being developed by Electronic Arts' DICE studio, known primarily for its work on the popular Battlefield franchise.
Battlefield has long stood as the chief rival to Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) Call of Duty series. Despite facing tough competition from Electronic Arts over the years, Activision's titles have continued to generate billions in sales.
Yet, Star Wars: Battlefront represents a unique challenge, one that should not be discounted by shareholders.
Riding a wave of Star Wars hypeElectronic Arts' management has said it plans to promote Star Wars: Battlefront aggressively, leveraging the power of the Star Wars cultural phenomenon to drive sales.
By the time Episode 7 debuts in theaters, it will have been more than a decade since the release of a Star Wars film. Anticipation should be high -- Disney paid $4 billion for a reason -- and it could be contagious, particularly among avid video game players.
Star Wars has served as inspiration for dozens of video games over the years, and many of them have proven to be quite popular. Star Wars: Battlefront is itself a reboot of a game originally released in 2004, one that sold roughly 3 million copies and earned a sequel.
If nothing else, the latest incarnation of Battlefront should benefit from a general interest in Star Wars sparked by the release of the film. It's also quite likely, however, that the game will be well-received: As a studio, DICE has a strong track record, with several critically acclaimed games under its belt, including Mirror's Edge and Battlefield 4.
Call of Duty may be facing franchise fatigueIt's entirely possible that gamers could purchase both, but Activision's next Call of Duty could lose some sales to Battlefront. Released around the same time, and in the same genre, the games are likely to compete for the same sort of gamers.
Already, Call of Duty is showing some signs of franchise fatigue. The latest installment -- Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare -- was 2014's single-best selling game, but demand for the series appears to have peaked. Yet, Activision has a plan to reinvigorate the series: Treyarch.  
Although all Call of Duty installments bear a similarity, Activision uses three different studios to create the series. Treyarch is making 2015's installment, which could result in a quality entry. Treyarch's past Call of Duty games -- particularly Black Ops and Black Ops II -- have been among the game's best received. The studio should additionally benefit from a three-year development cycle -- only the second Call of Duty game to do so.
Activision has other games to fall back onBut even if Treyarch's magic can't propel Call of Duty in 2015, Activision has other games to fall back on. World of Warcraft and Skylanders remain reliable cash cows, while Hearthstone and Destiny provide potential upside.
As an Activision shareholder with a long-term perspective, Star Wars: Battlefront doesn't frighten me enough to sell. That said, Activision investors should be aware of the threat, and perhaps be willing to ride out a bumpy winter if Battlefront, does, indeed, steal Call of Duty sales.

            ","Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) shares have been on fire as of late: Shares of the video game publisher are up more than 130% in the last year alone. That gain comes on a series of strong earnings reports. Most recently, Electronic Arts exceeded analyst expectations for the third quarter, posting better-than-expected revenue and earnings.
In its subsequent earnings call, Electronic Arts management touched on a number of positive trends that are supporting its business. Below are five of the most important quotes from that call.
Electronic Arts is seeing strong demand for nearly all of its gamesAs a publisher of video games, Electronic Arts' performance depends entirely on the success of its titles. Within the industry, Electronic Arts is well-diversified, with franchises in most genres, and games on most platforms, including mobile.
On the call, its CEO Andrew Wilson noted that the business appears to be strong on all fronts, with demand for its titles up across the board.
""Dragon Age: Inquisition was named to more than 200 Game of the Year lists ... More than 6 million people on average were playing FIFA games every week ... Madden NFL Mobile had its biggest day in franchise history on Christmas Day, reaching number four on the top grossing charts in the U.S. Apple App Store. And we finished the calendar year as the world's leading console ... publisher.""
The Ultimate Team initiative is paying offElectronic Arts' sports franchises (Madden, FIFA, NHL, UFC etc) benefit from yearly refreshes, but have suffered from a degree of cyclicality in the past, with interest waning in between annual releases.
But Electronic Arts has found a way to drive engagement year-round: Ultimate Team. Pioneered with its FIFA franchise, Ultimate Team has come to the majority of Electronic Arts sports titles, including Madden. With Ultimate Team, players build fantasy squads of elite players. Ultimate Team gives players a reason to play their favorite Electronic Arts sports title months after release, and benefits Electronic Arts through additional digital revenue. Wilson noted that engagement in Ultimate Team continues to be on the rise.
""Ultimate Team ... engagement is deeper than ever. The total number of players entering Ultimate Team across FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15 and NHL 15 has increased nearly 45% year-over-year.""
Electronic Arts should benefit from Episode 7Electronic Arts will release the next installment in its popular Battlefield franchise in March, but its 2015 marquee title is likely to be Star Wars: Battlefront.
Unfortunately, Electronic Arts hasn't given an exact release date for the game, but it's likely to debut sometime in November or December. Electronic Arts' management believes the game will be a blockbuster, as it should benefit from the release of Star Wars: Episode 7 (slated to open in theaters Dec. 18).
""We've got a ... Star Wars title coming in before Christmas next year, aligned with the Star Wars movie ... We're extremely excited about that and we think there is huge potential for that title ... you should consider that a very large activity for us next year and very large focus, similar to how we thought about Battlefield [games] in the past.""
Be wary of NPD dataResearch firm NPD tracks monthly U.S. video game sales, and its data is commonly seen as a strong indicator of the overall strength of the industry. Recent NPD data has been weak, with demand for video games seemingly declining on an annual basis for most of the last year.
However, Electronic Arts' CFO, Blake Jorgensen, warned investors to be cautious when considering NPD's data, as the firm does not track digital or international sales. With a growing number of Electronic Arts' games sold digitally, NPD is becoming increasingly irrelevant.
""Be really careful using NPD data, it's becoming less and less valuable, as more and more of the business is going digital ... both in volume and in pricing, it can be sometimes a very large distraction. And then when you add in that there is no international piece to it -- it really underestimates the strength of our business.""
More capital returns could be forthcomingElectronic Arts has nearly $3 billion of cash on its balance sheet, as of the end of last quarter. The company doesn't pay a dividend, but has been willing to return cash to shareholders via share repurchases.
When prompted, Jorgensen reiterated Electronic Arts' commitment to return cash to shareholders whenever possible.
""We're very committed to continuing to buyback stock. We are on track to be able to complete the $750 million two-year buyback, and as we generate more cash we'll consider greater buybacks ... I think we just have a simple model, which is saying how do we get [the cash] back to shareholders.""

            ","In December, I named Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) CEO Andrew Wilson the greatest tech CEO of 2014. Wilson's efforts to transform the video game publisher produced strong returns for investors, as Electronic Arts shares doubled in 2014.
The rally continues: In after-hours trading on Tuesday, Electronic Arts shares rose more than 4% following the release of its third-quarter results. Electronic Arts continues to perform at a high level, as gamers eagerly snap up its titles.
Digital continues to accelerateOn an adjusted basis, Electronic Arts generated $1.428 billion in the third quarter -- more than the $1.275 billion it had previously projected, and more than the $1.29 billion consensus analyst estimate. Nearly half of that amount -- $693 million -- was from digitally distributed content (rather than physical discs). On a trailing-12-month basis, more than 50% of Electronic Arts' revenue is now coming from digital sales.
The bulk of that digital revenue is from the sale of extra content -- primarily DLC add-ons, which give gamers additional levels, weapons, and other content for their existing games. Sales of that extra content rose 47% on an annual basis.
Sales of full-game downloads (which replace physical discs entirely) also continue to ramp up, rising 22% on an annual basis to account for about one-fifth of Electronic Arts' digital revenue. Electronic Arts' other digital sources -- mobile and subscriptions -- had less of an impact on a percentage basis but also rose, up 13% and 52%, respectively.
The strong demand for Electronic Arts' games and digital services translated into better-than-expected earnings: In the third quarter, Electronic Arts earned an adjusted $1.22 -- better than the $0.90 it had previously guided, and more than $0.92 consensus analyst estimate.
Dragon Age: Inquisition breaks recordsDragon Age: Inquisition was Electronic Arts' premier title in the fourth quarter. The role-playing game doesn't have the sort of broad-based appeal of Electronic Arts' popular Madden and Battlefield franchises, but it still managed to set records for Electronic Arts' BioWare studio. It also earned numerous Game of the Year Awards for 2014, increasing Electronic Arts' cache among core gamers.
Mobile games are seeing increased engagementElectronic Arts is the leader in sports-based video games, with several core franchises including NHL, Madden, UFC, and FIFA. Although these franchises primarily serve console gamers, Electronic Arts has released some of them for mobile platforms.
Those mobile sports games are seeing increasing popularity: In the third quarter, monthly active players for Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team rose 45% on an annual basis. In total, Electronic Arts' mobile games averaged 160 million monthly active users in the third quarter.
In addition to its sports franchises, Electronic Arts has brought several of its other franchises to mobile. In December, it launched SimCity BuildIt -- a mobile adaptation of its long-running PC franchise, SimCity.
Benefiting from the new console cycle and a digital shiftOverall, the third quarter was strong for Electronic Arts, and its near-term prospects appear quite bullish. In calendar year 2014, Electronic Arts was the top publisher on both next-generation consoles -- PlayStation 4 and Xbox One -- and that could continue for some time. In March, Electronic Arts will release the next installment in its Battlefield series, and later in the year, it will launch Star Wars: Battlefront in concert with the debut of Star Wars: Episode 7.
The past 12 months have been great for Electronic Arts' shareholders, and as the current console cycle continues to ramp up, the video game publisher could continue to reward investors.

            ","The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) market index gained 12% in 2014. That's pretty much in line with the market's 12% to 13% annual returns over the long term. As always, some stocks ran ahead of the pack, raising the market's average returns.
Here are three of last year's biggest winners in the tech sector, including a couple of unexpected surprises. Video game publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) more than doubled in price, while high-tech materials maker Corning (NYSE:GLW) and social networking giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) crushed the market in a kinder, gentler way.

The college of market-beating arts and sciencesStarting at the top, Electronic Arts delivered a shocking 105% gain in 2014 -- right on the heels of a 66% return in 2013.
This is largely an industrywide trend, as video game designers ride the support of recently updated consoles. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) nearly doubled over these two years, and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) gained an even stronger 160%.
But of course, none of them can hold a candle to Electronic Arts' sector-leading 242% gains, including the 105% last-year surge mentioned above.
Fellow Fool Sam Mattera pinpoints the company's fantastic performance to the hiring of CEO Andrew Wilson in the fall of 2013. Wilson has turned around a terrible public image with the help of a smart sales and marketing revamp, latching on to digital distribution methods in a big way.
Thanks to Wilson's sharp thinking and execution, Electronic Arts is delivering consistent earnings and sharply rising cash flows, underpinning the big market move with solid fundamentals.
If you saw this market-crushing year coming when Wilson took the CEO job -- an unheralded internal promotion, and not even the most likely Electronic Arts veteran for the post -- your crystal ball is way better than mine. Now, the stock looks poised to continue beating the market, fueled by Wilson's new-age strategy and starting from reasonable share prices of just 14 times trailing free cash flows.
How much longer will this be the social network?If Electronic Arts flew under the radar to get to the top, Facebook followed more of an open path. The social network beat back skeptics like yours truly by making large strides in mobile ad sales and delivering increasingly solid profits. Facebook's stock followed suit with a solid 43% gain.
Facebook is becoming a must-have advertising platform and a peerless viral marketing vehicle. My Foolish peers think it's just the beginning of a lasting trend, too.
Tim Brugger believes the stock can soar even higher in 2015, driven by efforts to make money from its splashy $2.7 billion Instagram buyout.
Brian Stoffel goes even further, calling Facebook a market-beater for the next decade. Why? Because founder and leader Mark Zuckerberg has a knack for finding the next big trend before the rest of us got tired of the last one. Instagram is just one example of this deep vision; Oculus Rift might be the next big winner.
This being the Motley Fool, I don't have to agree with my colleagues. My thumbs-down rating on Facebook is currently the biggest loser in my CAPS portfolio, but I have no plans to turn that frown upside down.
I'm impressed by Zuckerberg's success in 2014, but not convinced that he can keep the good times rolling. The social media market has a history of sudden, violent upheavals, and the younger generation is already showing signs of getting bored with current leader Facebook. If and when they move on to the next global water cooler, turning Facebook into the next MySpace (Ouch!) or Friendster (Who? Exactly!), I'd hate to have that stock in my retirement portfolio.
Facebook may make it through 2015 without hitting that brutal event. But for every year Facebook continues to lead its core market of social networking, I'm more convinced that it might be the last one. Don't back up the truck to this stock -- make sure you can afford to lose whatever you put into it.
Flat-out speedRounding out this market-beating rally, Corning turned a corner in 2014 with a 32% return on your investment.
Its mobile screen-cover dominance was threatened by up-and-coming sapphire alternatives, until that threat literally fell apart. Meanwhile, Corning presented even thinner and stronger Gorilla Glass products for mobile applications and made a play for large-screen television screens. That timing of that last move could prove prophetic if consumers around the world start upgrading their TV sets to next-generation 4K screens in 2015, as they very well might.
Until then, Corning investors can revel in a hockey-stick growth curve for the glassware veteran's cash flows. Despite Corning's huge share price gains in 2014, the market might still not have factored in all of its refreshed cash-making proficiency, not to mention the growth drivers already discussed:

Corning has close ties to the unstoppable mobile computing market, but it doesn't live and die by that industry alone. If you're looking for a proven veteran with diverse end-user markets and a rocket plume of momentum at its back, Corning might be worth a second look today.
