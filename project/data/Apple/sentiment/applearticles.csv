2017-11-17T07:48:00-05:00,"On Nov. 14, Bloomberg published a report claiming that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) intends to add a ""rear-facing 3D sensor"" to its flagship iPhones slated to launch in 2019. Bloomberg said this represents ""another step toward turning the handset into a leading augmented-reality device,"" citing ""people familiar with the plan.""

This year's iPhone X includes a 3D sensor embedded in the front-facing camera system, which Apple dubs a TrueDepth camera. This sensor is used for features such as Apple's Face ID biometric authentication as well as for the company's animated emoji feature, Animoji.

The rear-facing 3D sensor in the 2019 iPhone models will reportedly work differently from the one found in the iPhone X's front-facing TrueDepth camera system.

""The existing system relies on a structured-light technique that projects a pattern of 30,000 laser dots onto a user's face and measures the distortion to generate an accurate [3D] image for authentication,"" the Bloomberg article explained.

The system on the rear-facing cameras on the 2019 iPhones will, instead, ""use a time-of-flight approach that calculates the time it takes for a laser to bounce off surrounding objects to create a three-dimensional picture of the environment.""

The good news is that if Apple can get this technology worked out, it'll have a compelling selling point for its 2019 iPhones. A rear-facing 3D sensor alone won't be enough to carry the product cycle on its own, but as the headline feature combined with other, more routine, upgrades (e.g. camera quality, processing power, potential form factor improvements, and so on), it'd be quite nice.

In addition to helping Apple sell more iPhones during the product cycle beginning in the second half of 2019, the inclusion of such technology in a high-volume smartphone should afford developers the freedom to build augmented reality applications designed to take advantage of the new rear-facing 3D sensing capabilities.

If augmented reality takes off on the iOS platform thanks to continued hardware advancements, then Apple will have cultivated the ecosystem for a ""killer app"" that could help drive iPhone upgrades.

The bad news is that from the sound of this report, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo was right about Apple forgoing the inclusion of a rear-facing 3D sensor in the 2018 iPhones. That's obviously a selling point that could've helped Apple maintain iPhone growth momentum in the next iPhone product cycle.

Not all is lost, though. Next year, Apple is expected to introduce a new ultra-high-end version of the iPhone X with a gigantic 6.46-inch display as well as a lower-cost iPhone that includes many of the key technologies of the iPhone X (full face display, TrueDepth camera). It'll also sell an upgraded version of this year's iPhone X with a 5.85-inch organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, as well.

I think that bringing the best of this year's iPhone X to lower price points as well as to larger form factors, coupled with the standard upgrades that Apple introduces with each generation, should be more than enough to allow Apple to continue enjoying iPhone unit shipments in the coming fiscal year."
2017-11-17T09:30:00-05:00,"This year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released three new iPhones: iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X. All three of these devices shared the same basic internals, including, most prominently, the new A11 Bionic applications processor.

Apple positioned the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as the company's new flagship devices, with the iPhone X seemingly positioned as an ultra-premium device that's supposed to give customers a glimpse into the future of the iPhone.

Next year, Apple is also expected to introduce three new iPhones: an entry-level model with a 6.1-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) as well as two premium models with more advanced 5.85-inch and 6.46-inch organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays.

While Apple positioned the three new iPhones this year as flagship models, I believe that there's a good chance that only the two OLED models will be positioned as flagship devices.

Indeed, at this point, I think I can make a compelling case that the LCD iPhone that Apple introduces next year won't be positioned as a flagship device and, as such, will recycle much of the internal specifications of this year's iPhone X -- including the A11 Bionic chip.

The key assumption that I'm making here is that Apple will opt to recycle the same basic camera subsystem used in either the iPhone 8 Plus or the iPhone X in the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone. If this proves to be the case, then the A11 Bionic chip, which successfully powers the camera subsystems of the iPhone X, can power the camera subsystem of next year's 6.1-inch LCD iPhone.

If it doesn't and Apple introduces an all-new camera subsystem with the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone, then the use of the A11 Bionic becomes far less likely as camera performance in Apple's iPhones depends heavily on the capabilities of a dedicated processor, known as an image signal processor (ISP), that's embedded in each of Apple's A-series chips.

But, for the sake of this analysis, let's assume that I'm right that Apple won't endow the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone with the same new camera subsystems that it includes in the new OLED models.

The CPU performance of the A11 Bionic is already best-in-class, so the general performance of an A11-based LCD iPhone in web surfing as well as in any app present in the Apple App Store should be quite snappy.

In terms of graphics/display performance, the A11 Bionic should have an easier time driving the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone's display than it does pushing the displays on either the iPhone 8 Plus or the iPhone X.

Since the resolution of the display of the LCD iPhone should be somewhere in the ballpark of 1822-by-840 pixels (this is an estimate based on KGI Securities' pixel density claims), the chip inside of the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone will only need to draw about 1.53 million pixels (the more pixels the chip needs to draw, the more performance is required of the chip).

The A11 Bionic inside of the iPhone 8 Plus must draw about 2.07 million pixels, while that same chip inside of the iPhone X must draw a whopping 2.74 million pixels.

The A11 Bionic should therefore handle the graphics and display needs of the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone with ease.

If Apple were to give the new 6.1-inch LCD iPhone an older chip, it certainly wouldn't be an unprecedented move. For example, Apple's successful low-cost iPad includes a relatively dated A9 chip, while the two higher-end iPad Pro tablets use the company's latest A10X Fusion chip.

Now, next year's 6.1-inch LCD iPhone will, by no means, be positioned as Apple's lowest-end iPhone, so it still needs a modern, fast applications processor. But I think the A11 Bionic is more than good enough to power the experience that Apple wants to deliver with that device, and I believe it will reserve the A12 for the higher-end iPhones and use it as a selling point for those devices."
2017-11-16T08:00:00-05:00,"According to generally reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is planning to launch three new iPhones next year. One of these new iPhones will be a new version of this year's iPhone X, which incorporates a 5.85-inch organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display; another will be a larger version of that updated iPhone X, but with a gigantic 6.46-inch OLED display; and the last will be an iPhone with 6.1-inch liquid crystal display (LCD).

The LCD model is expected to be the cheapest model in the lineup, as LCD technology costs less and and is less advanced than OLED technology. Additionally, per Kuo, the LCD model will ""differ significantly from the OLED models in hardware and design specs.""

There's quite a lot of skepticism about this report. For example, respected Apple blogger John Gruber expressed doubt that the iPhone X's core design would ""trickle down to the $750 price range after just one year.""

He also doesn't think the display size makes sense and ultimately concludes that he doesn't think Kuo's report is correct.

Apple has sold phones with the same basic form factor as the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus for four product generations now: iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, and iPhone 8. While Apple has, of course, brought numerous technology and user experience innovations with each new model, the truth is that form factor is an important selling point to the average consumer.

Considering this, Apple really wouldn't be smart to try to trot out the same basic form factors to handle the traditional iPhone price points next year, especially as the competitive environment will only intensify over the next year. At the same time, Apple probably wouldn't be wise to compromise on the features and designs of next year's 5.85-inch and 6.46-inch OLED iPhones, either, as the apparent success of the iPhone X seems to indicate that many iPhone buyers will pay premiums for compelling features and aesthetics.

Nevertheless, Apple still needs a product to serve customers that don't want to pay more for the iPhone X.

So, to Gruber's point, not only do I think that Apple cascade down the basic iPhone X features to lower price points (albeit with some compromises such as the use of LCDs instead of OLED displays),Â but Apple really won't have much choice but to do so if it wants to stay competitive.

An iPhone with a 6.1-inch full-face LCD would probably occupy a physical footprint that's just a bit larger than that of the current iPhone X (which has a 5.85-inch full-face OLED display). This means that it'd occupy a larger footprint than the current iPhone 8 with 4.7-inch LCD and a smaller footprint than the current iPhone 8 Plus with a 5.5-inch LCD.

In terms of physical footprint, think of it as the average of the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus. But, thanks to a full-face display, it'd offer users more screen real-estate -- a clear win.

Considering that Apple's iPhone 7 Plus performed surprisingly well during the last product cycle and Apple CEO Tim Cook's commentary about the iPhone 8 Plus getting ""off to the fastest start of any Plus model,"" there's a clear shift in customer preference toward larger-screen devices.

A 6.1-inch LCD iPhone serving as Apple's entry-level flagship iPhone would mean that Apple is, yet again, forcing a screen-size increase upon users, just as it did when it introduced the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus back in the fall of 2014.

There will, of course, be those folks that may resist such a screen size increase. However, I think that those within the iPhone installed base that are reluctant to move to even larger screen sizes will ultimately (and perhaps grudgingly) move to larger-screen iPhones and then quickly find that something like the iPhone 8 is simply too small.

Apple's making the right call here, and I think the performance of Apple's iPhone business in the years ahead will bear that hypothesis out."
2017-11-17T17:30:27Z,"On Friday morning, shares of Apple (AAPL) were a little weaker thanks to the broad market being lower, but we also received some short term negative product news. The highly anticipated HomePod smart speaker has been delayed to 2018, which will certainly disappoint those who wanted it for Christmas. This isn't a big surprise in my opinion, and as such, investors should not change their opinion of the stock due to a small delay.

Originally, the HomePod was supposed to start shipping to customers in December, but now that time frame has been adjusted to ""early 2018"". This might not be a total surprise, if you remember back in September I talked about there being some disappointment that there was no HomePod discussion at the iPhone event. With no other major Apple events in October or anything scheduled for November, I am not totally surprised that the release was pushed back.

This looks exactly like what we saw last year with the release of the AirPods. Apple delayed its release because the product was ""not ready for customers"". While some will worry about production problems, just like we saw with the iPhone X, it is clear that Apple is prioritizing quality here, not wanting to ship a brand new product until it is 100% ready. That didn't seem to impact sales of the AirPods at all last year, given they've been one of the company's hottest items this year.

The major question here that investors will ask is how much will this impact the company's financials? Well, even if there had been a December launch, I'm guessing that Apple was going to be supply constrained at launch like it usually is, so I wasn't banking on anything more than maybe a few hundred thousand units at most before the end of 2017 anyway. With management providing a $3 billion range for its revenue guidance in the period, there was easily enough room to absorb this ""hit"", if you are one that assumes management was originally counting on revenues coming this quarter. At a $349 price, even a million units was only $349 million in revenue, a drop in the bucket when you are looking for more than $86 billion in the period.

Now it is completely possible that management excluded any contribution from HomePod in the period when it gave guidance. As you saw in the image above, analysts are already expecting much more growth in the March period as the iPhone X ramps up, as well as the HomePod. If you think that the timeline will be pushed back a bit, maybe the street will push some March quarter revenues into the June period, but at this point it shouldn't be anything significant that will change the overall story.

At the same time, we're still waiting to hear news about the other major product coming from Apple in December, the new iMac Pro. This is the most powerful desktop machine that the company has ever built, and the incredible tech specs give it a premium $4,999 price. The Mac line was perhaps the star of the show in the September quarter for Apple, not only showing 10% unit sales growth over the prior year period, but 25% revenue growth, easily surpassing estimates. Average selling prices will rise further once this iMac Pro beast starts shipping to customers.

So while Apple may have disappointed some customers Friday with the news that it is delaying shipments of the HomePod smart speaker until early 2018, I don't think investors should react in any big way to this news. Just like with the AirPods last year, Apple wants to get it right, and that's the best strategy. We just have to shift some revenues a bit forward, but there probably isn't going to be any major impact to the December period anyway given expectations for just a few week of sales were likely low given normal supply constraints at launch. As I've continued to state, any weakness in Apple shares for investors is an opportunity to add more, and news like this likely could play right into that notion.

2017-11-17T10:56:08-05:00,"What greater conundrum does the value investor have but to choose whether to buy Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) stock now, wait for a better entry or just hide in the closet and forget about it?

Itâs not like APPL stock hasnât had its share of setbacks. A couple of years back, AAPL stock was sitting in the 90âs and people were saying the best days of AAPL stock were behind it.

Today AAPL stock sits at $170 per share with a market cap of $876 billion, almost a third of which is straight up cash. To figure out what to do, you first have to determine your time horizon.Â The Liberty Portfolio, my stock advisory newsletter, has a minimum time horizon ofÂ 10 years, and it seeks stocks that are both value and growth oriented, but with limited risk.

Iâm not concerned about AAPL stock in the long-term. Iâm concerned that the market is 30% overvalued and AAPL stock could take a hit in a broad market selloff. So the question is whether it is a value play right now.

In its last report, Q4 revenue increased about 12%, and about 6.5% for the year. Gross margin was about the same at 38%. Net income was up $1.7 billion to $10.7 billion for the quarter, and up from $45.69 billion to $48.35 billion. Thatâs increases of 19% and 5%, respectively.

Iâm going to take 20% off the $172 billion of net cash to account for possible repatriation of that cash, via taxation. Thus, I back out $138 billion or about $25 per share in cash to value the business on its own. So APPL stock trades at $144 (net of cash) and on $9.21 in EPS for the year, trades at 15.6x FY17 earnings.

Analysts see 11.6% annualized EPS growth going forward. Now, I give APPL stock a 10% premium each for having a world-class brand name, strong cash position, and fantastic cash flow â $64 billion in operating cash flow for the year.

Thus, I get a fair value for APPL stock right at 15x earnings. So far, so good. Does the underlying business support this valuation? My concerns with Apple stock price have been centered around the companyâs apparent inability to get into new businesses. The iPhone accounted for 70% of sales."
2017-11-17T04:01:37-05:00,"Investing guru Warren Buffett has always been cautious about the tech sector. A rapidly changing landscape and fierce competition make it difficult to choose a winner for the long term. However, Buffett has been a bit more open to tech investments over the past few years and a recent regulatory filing showed that the Oracle of Omaha has been buying up shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ).

Earlier this week, regulatory filings showed that Buffett increased his holdings of AAPL stock by 3% during the third quarter to a total 134 million shares. His purchase makes him the fifth-largest Apple stock holder.

To be sure, data on these purchases is somewhat outdated and itâs never a good idea to blindly follow anyone, even Warren Buffet, I think he is on to something. The AAPL stock price has been on a bit of a roller coaster ride so far this year as worries about iPhone sales weighed on investor confidence in Appleâs future.

However, even with the ups and downs, AAPL stock has still increased more than 45% so far this year, that, combined with the tech-makerâs strong financial position, compelling moat and strong brand position, make it a good long-term pick. As AAPL stock has declined 4% over the last five day, we are at a good entry point.

Appleâs fourth quarter results beat expectations and gave investors a reason to believe that The Fruit was on its way back to the top. Revenue came in at $52.6 billion, above analysts expectations of $50.7 billion. More importantly, AAPL topped forecasts of 46 million for iPhone unit sales, with the actual figure coming in slightly higher at 46.7 million.

Although the iPhone unit sales were only marginally higher than what analysts were expecting, Apple brought in a ton of cash as the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus became the firmâs best-selling products as soon as they were launched.

Guidance for the future was equally as impressive with revenue seen rising to somewhere between $84 billion and $87 billion in the first quarter.

That will add to Appleâs already strong financial position. The company is sitting on a big pile of cash, which bodes well for investors inÂ several ways."
2017-11-16T09:57:21-05:00,"When Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) released its Q4 earnings results at the start of November, much of the focus was on iPhone sales and record Services revenue. But Mac revenue was also strong â the highest September quarter ever. And a new report says that refreshed MacBook Pros, back-to-school and educational purchases combined for MacBook sales that pushed Apple into fourth place globally among laptop makers for Q3 2017.

Those MacBook numbers may not have had a huge impact on AAPL stock, but it has been a while since there was good news on the Mac sales front.

Apple doesnât officially spike out MacBook sales versus other Mac sales in its quarterly results. However, TrendForce tracks laptop sales and the market research firm published its numbers for Q3 2017. According to the TrendForce report, Apple MacBook sales were 4.43 million units, up 11.3% from the previous quarter.

Appleâs numbers outperformed the industry in general, which saw global laptop shipments rise 6.8% compared to the second quarter, and was second only to HP Inc (NYSE: ), which notched a 17.6% quarterly gain.

The increase in MacBook sales wasÂ enough to move Apple into fourth place among global laptop makers, with a 10.4% overall market share. ASUS dropped to fifth place, with 8.9%, while HP was on top at 25.8%.

Naturally, the TrendForce report leads to the age-old argument about how different market research firms track numbers. IDC and Gartner previously released Q3 reports and while they both tracked overall Mac sales (instead of spiking out MacBook sales), they came up with conflicting results. About the only fact that all three firms can agree on about that third quarter is that HP remains firmly on top of global PC sales.

However, Appleâs Q4 numbers tell the full story of Mac sales â no speculation or projection here â and it was good news.

AAPLâs fourth quarter â July 1 to Sept. 30 â corresponds to the global third quarter used by market research firms, so we are comparing apples to apples when talking numbers."
2017-11-15T14:40:00-05:00,"Warren Buffett is famously averse to investing in tech companies, in part because technology advances so quickly that the competitive landscape can shift quickly. Earlier this year, the Oracle of Omaha concededÂ that he was ""too dumb"" and missed the boat on Amazon.com, and that it was also a mistake to have never bought shares of Alphabet.

Buffett started dipping his toes into tech way back in 2011, when he first invested Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) money in IBM (NYSE:IBM). It would take another five years before the famed investor would initiate a position in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). To date, these are the only two tech stocks that Berkshire owns. However, IBM seems to have fallen out of Buffett's favor in recent years, while Apple appears ascendant.

Institutional investors are now filing quarterly ownership disclosures, and Berkshire's filingÂ showed that Buffett's holding company added 3.9 million shares of Apple in the third quarter (a sequential increase of 3%), while selling off over 17 million shares of IBM (a sequential decrease of 31.5%). The number of Apple shares that Berkshire bought in the third quarter is fairly modest, particularly compared to the shares added in Q4 2016 and Q1 2017.

If you look at how many shares of each company Berkshire has held over the past two years, it's pretty clear that Berkshire is losing confidence in Big Blue while betting more on the Mac maker.

The numbers of shares held only tell part of the story, though. Berkshire first startedÂ buying IBM stock in March 2011, and IBM has performed abysmally relative to the broader market in that time frame. The S&P 500 has nearly doubled, while IBM is down 8% (not including dividends).

In contrast, Apple has outpaced the S&P 500 since the beginning of 2016, and Buffett has already made billions on his position.

""I don't value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying... I've revalued it somewhat downward,"" Buffett toldÂ CNBC in May.Â Both IBM and Apple sport cheap valuation metrics and strong cash flow relative to other tech companies, which is probably what drew Buffett to the tech giants in the first place.

Hopefully, Berkshire's Apple gains can offset some of its losses on IBM."
2017-11-14T15:33:00-05:00,"The only official metric that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) disclosed about Apple Watch during last quarter's earnings release was that the smartwatch enjoyed ""unit growth of over 50% for the third consecutive quarter."" Lacking a base figure for that growth, investors remain largely in the dark regarding Watch sales and have to rely on third-party estimates.

Market researcher Canalys has put out its most recent estimates for the wearable band market, and says that Apple Watch Series 3 helped the company regain the No. 1 spot in the third quarter. Apple shipped 3.9 million Apple Watches last quarter, according to Canalys.

China's Xiaomi, which was the No. 1 vendor in the secondÂ quarter, fell to the No. 2 spot with 3.6 million units, while Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) came in at No. 3 with 3.5 million units shipped. The overall market contracted modestly, falling 2% to 17.3 million units as consumer preferences continue to shift away from basic trackers and toward full-featured devices like smartwatches. That trend has been unfolding for a while now, but accelerated this year, as seen in Fitbit's unit volumes.

Canalys analyst Jason Low notes that cellular connectivity appears to be driving demand, which is mitigating concerns at wireless carriers that consumers aren't interested in cellular smartwatches (a concern that I shared previously). The researcher estimates that approximately 800,000 Apple Watches shipped during the quarter -- about a fifth -- included cellular connectivity. Domestic carriers are charging $10 per month to add a data plan for Apple Watch, which could be rather profitable, as actual data usage will probably be quite low. Nobody's streaming video to such a small screen.

The device suffered from some modest supply constraints in several important markets like China, as Series 3 launchedÂ with just days left in the third quarter alongside the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.

More broadly, Apple says its total wearables business grew 75% last quarter as well as throughout fiscal 2017, and is now the size of a Fortune 400 company. No. 400 on the Fortune 500 forÂ 2017 was Calpine, with $6.7 billion in revenue, so we can say Apple's wearables business is at least that large and represents over half of the company's ""Other Products"" segment, which generated $12.9 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017.

The Mac maker uses a unique definition for wearables and includes wireless headphones like AirPods and BeatsX as well as Apple Watch. In contrast, market researchers like IDC do not include wireless headphones in the wearables category unless they include other additional features, such as health/fitness tracking, integrated artificial intelligence (AI) that isn't just coming through a paired smartphone, augmented audio, or real-time translation.

With an augmented reality (AR) headset in the works that would inevitably be considered a wearable as well, it could be just a matter of time before Apple officially breaks out wearables into a distinct reportable product segment."
2017-11-14T08:00:00-05:00,"Over the last several years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has continued to dramatically increase its spending on research and development.

Fully funded research and development activities are critically important to a company's long-term success. Such spending allows companies to both significantly enhance existing product lines (in Apple's case, this would include iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch) while also working to develop entirely new product categories.

Additionally, Apple has brought an increasing amount of technology development in-house to reduce its dependence on third-party suppliers and to increase the amount of proprietary technology that it owns, enhancing its competitive positioning in the marketplace.

During fiscal year 2017, Apple once again cranked up the amount of money it's investing in research and development. Here's why investors should care.

In fiscal year 2017, Apple spent $11.58 billion on research and development activities. That was a nearly $1.6 billion increase from the $10 billion that the company spent during fiscal year 2016. In the year before that, Apple spent just $8.07 billion on research and development.

This means that over just two short years, Apple increased its research and development spending by about $3.5 billion.

Apple isn't yet the biggest R&D spender in tech, though; that honor goes to search giantÂ Alphabet, which spent $13.95 billion in research and development in calendar year 2016Â and is on track to spend even more this year (Alphabet spent $12.32 billion in research and development in just the first nine months of 2017 alone).

However, it's clear that Apple is still increasing its investments at a furious pace, no doubt to try to extend its leadership positions in the smartphone, tablet, and PC markets, feed its investments in services, Apple Watch, and new accessories, and increase its bets on new areas like augmented reality and possibly autonomous driving.

Apple, of course, isn't going to publicly disclose where exactly that increase came from, but it did say in its form 10-K filing that the research and development bump in fiscal year 2017 was due to ""increases in headcount-related expenses and material costs to support expanded R&D activities.""

Apple's clearly investing heavily in its future.

Ultimately, Apple's increased spending means that the product portfolio that we'll see coming out of the company in the years ahead will continue to get better.

Now, I know what you're thinking: Of course new products will be better than the ones that came before them, otherwise it wouldn't make sense for Apple to release them in the first place.

That's not quite what I'm trying to convey, though. What this expanded spending will allow Apple to do is to make bigger strides in each generation so that each new product generation is better and more competitive relative to what it faces in the marketplace than prior products were.

Perhaps the best example of this is the iPhone X. For the first time in what seems like years, Apple has released a phone that not only achieves leadership across every relevant technology vector, but it incorporates fundamentally new, paradigm-shifting hardware and software that's unmatched by anything currently in the market today.

I think Apple's increased spending will allow it to deliver more such iPhone X-level product innovations going forward, and because Apple is so financially successful, increasingly fewer companies will be able to compete with Apple in its core businesses over time."
2017-11-13T16:09:00-05:00,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launches its HomePod next month, the company's response to the growing market for smart speakers powered by virtual assistants. Investors haven't heard much about the device ever since it was unveiled over the summer at WWDC. Judging by Apple's continued unwillingness to share detailed financial results for Apple Watch, shareholders should similarly expect Apple to include HomePod sales in its broader ""Other Products"" category, with an occasional announcement of a significant statistic or milestone.

That's where third-party estimates come in. Fubon Securities analyst Arthur Liao expects Apple to sell 4 million HomePods in 2018, according to The Nikkei Asian Review.

At $350 per HomePod, that estimate would translate into $1.4 billion in revenue. While that's modest in the context of Apple's overall business, it would still represent a healthy start for Apple entering an entirely new product category. It's too early to get a sense of what the HomePod's cost structure will look like, and management hasn't discussed it on any conference calls yet, either.

The smart speaker market is expected to jump to 24 million units in 2017, accordingÂ to Strategy Analytics. That would represent massive growth over the estimated 5.9 millionÂ units shipped in 2016, and the market researcher believes that more product choices as companies jump in will drive consumer adoption. First-party speakers like Amazon.com's Echo or Alphabet's Google Home are expected to dominate the market in the foreseeable future, but third-party devices that integrate virtual assistants -- like Samsung's Harman Kardon Invoke that uses Microsoft's Cortana, or the Sonos One that uses Amazon Alexa -- should start to gain share in the years ahead.

It's never too early to speculate on future Apple products, even though the first-generation HomePod hasn't even launched yet. The second-generation HomePod is now expected to include 3D sensing and Face ID, according to the report. Contract manufacturer Inventec Appliances, which is expected to manufacture the HomePod, told investors on an earnings call that companies are starting to design smart speakers with facial and image recognition.

""We see trends that engineers are designing smart speakers that will not only come with voice recognition but also incorporate features such as facial and image recognition,""Â President David Ho said. ""Such AI-related features are set to make people's lives more convenient and to make the product easier to use.""

Ho did not refer to Apple specifically, but Apple is pushing facial recognition technology forward in a big way with its TrueDepth system and Face ID biometric security. Apple's offerings differ dramatically from existing technologies that essentially analyze 2D images instead of creating a 3D depth map of a user's face. Yuanta Investment Consulting analyst Jeff Pu doesn't expect 3D-sensing HomePods to arrive until 2019.

Apple's product cycles are now sometimes 18 to 24 months for less-important products like Apple Watch or iPad, so it's feasible that Apple wouldn't release a second-generation HomePod until 2019, when the supply chain for 3D-sensing components is more mature. As the industry ramps production capabilities, those gains should probably be allocated to the 2018 iPhones and iPads first anyway.

Now Apple just needs to make Siri competitive."
2017-11-16T04:54:00Z,"Johny Srouji is SVP Hardware Technologies at Apple (AAPL), heading up the development and design of Apple's custom A-series systems on chip (SOCs). It was Srouji who led the design of Apple's first A4 SOC in the first iPad. I have argued many times that Apple has become one of the most important semiconductor companies on the planet, and Srouji has had an awful lot to do with that.

Srouji was born in the beautiful Israeli port city of Haifa, and educated nearby at the Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology. He recently gave an interview with the tech site Calcalist, providing useful insights into the chip design process at Apple. He also had some interesting tidbits of information regarding the involvement of PrimeSense, the Israeli company Apple acquired in 2013, in the TrueDepth sensor design.

On the long gestation of Apple chips:

Silicon is unforgiving. My team is already working on the chips you're going to see in 2020. You make bets. We have the system and the software. We have better knowledge versus external chipmakers about where things are going to end up. Since we own the silicon, we own the software, the operating system and everything else, we deliver, always. We deliver for the exact specification of iOS and nothing else. We don't have to worry about other operating systems.

I've often tried to capture the importance and value of controlling both the silicon design and the operating system design, and Srouji sums it up beautifully. I've also argued that development lead times are very long, but I haven't heard anyone from Apple confirm this directly before.

The implications for the current A11 Bionic are interesting. Apple began planning the chip roughly three years ago. Fairly early in the planning stage, Apple's hardware and OS teams had to have realized that they wanted to implement machine learning and inference algorithms locally on the mobile device, rather than in the cloud.

In 2014 or 2015, no one was doing that, or even talking about doing it. Conventional wisdom was that it had to be done in the cloud. Those hardware and OS teams had to have realized that special purpose hardware was needed to make that work, which would need to be provisioned early in the SOC design process. This became the Apple Neural Engine inside the A11.

Whew! Makes you wonder what they're planning for 2020, doesn't it? If Apple believes so strongly in the importance and value of controlling both hardware and software/OS design, wouldn't it make sense for Apple to apply that principle to all of Apple's products?

One of the things I have wondered about the new TrueDepth sensor in iPhone X is whether PrimeSense, the company that developed the technology, was still involved in the development of TrueDepth. Sometimes, when Apple buys a company, key people leave, and whatever is left is simply assimilated.

Apple employs about 900 people in Israel, and Srouji confirmed that the team from PrimeSense was involved in the development of Face ID, the key function of the TrueDepth sensor. Srouji stated that

In addition to being able to draw upon engineering and scientific talent that might not be available in the US, Apple can make use of its overseas revenue to support the activities. Apple's global reach argues effectively against the premise that its overseas cash can't be put to good use. It can and it is.

When the A10X Fusion processor of the iPad Pro came out last summer, I called it Apple's Fastest Processor Ever. Not only was it faster than contemporaneous mobile processors such as the Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon 835 and the Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) Exynos 8895, it was faster than some Intel (INTC) Core series processors. Apple's processor dominance was extended further by the new A11 Bionic, as I showed in this graph summarizing Geekbench single and multi-core scores.

Rumors are already swirling about a future A11X chip for the next generation iPad Pro. Although it is claimed to be from supply chain sources, the rumor about the A11X sounds like an argument by analogy.

The A10X was the first Apple SOC to be fabricated on TSMC's (TSM) 10 nm process, which was just starting to ramp up in Q2 of this year. Rumor has it that the A11X will be fabricated on TSMC's 7 nm process, which likewise will be ramping early next year.

The A10X is a multi-core design with 3 high performance and 3 high efficiency cores. A11X is rumored to feature 3 high performance and 5 high efficiency cores. Given the likely move to the 7 nm node, the additional CPU cores are a likely way for Apple to extract more performance out of what will probably be about the same size chip.

With each new X series SOC, Apple makes performance inroads against Intel, but perhaps not in 2018, if Intel finally gets its 10 nm process going.

Apple is part of the Rethink Technology Portfolio and is a recommended Buy.

2017-11-10T22:36:00-05:00,"On Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) most recent earnings call, several analysts tried to get Apple management to talk about the sales mix of iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X that Apple expects to see in the coming quarters.

Analysts, of course, want as much information as possible to try to build accurate forecasts of Apple's iPhone revenue for the current fiscal year. Since iPhone revenue depends on both unit shipments as well as average selling prices, and since average selling prices depend on product mix, it's not hard to see why they were so interested in trying to get this information out of Apple's top brass.

Apple executives, of course, didn't provide this information, explicitly stating multiple times that the company doesn't provide historical product mix information or product mix projections, but that didn't stop analysts from trying to ask the same questions in slightly different ways to sneak answers out of the executives.

It's not in Apple's best interests to signal to its competitors what sort of product mix it's ultimately selling. To understand why, suppose that every quarter, Apple provided a detailed breakdown of its iPhone shipments by model and storage configuration.

Apple's competitors would immediately gain insight into what Apple's worst and best-selling products are, allowing them to adjust their product portfolios to more effectively compete with Apple. For example, if that data showed that Apple's best-selling iPhone was the iPhone 8 Plus with 256 GB of storage (I suspect that prior to the launch of the iPhone X, this was probably true), a competitor would know the following:

In response to this information, an Apple competitor could shift its product development pipeline as well as its marketing strategy to more effectively go after Apple customers. Additionally, if Apple routinely provided this information, competitors could gain insights into the sales trends of different iPhones across a range of price points over time, allowing them to further adjust their product development and marketing strategies.

Of course, this isn't to say that Apple's competitors don't do their own market research, or that market trends that impact Apple's business don't apply to competitors' businesses. But the less informed Apple's competitors are of the specifics of Apple's business performance, the better it is for Apple.

Another reason that Apple probably doesn't want to disclose its expected product mix is that this is something that's subject to change.

Let's say Apple provided a forecast of the mix of iPhones that it expected to sell in the current quarter. Analysts and investors would immediately take those mix projections and use them to build forecasts going out multiple quarters, if not multiple years.

That'd be fine -- unless Apple's mix projections turn out to be wrong. If Apple's product mix comes in less favorably than expected, then both analysts and investors might become unduly negative toward Apple and its prospects. It could also reduce investor confidence in Apple's trustworthiness, even if the projection that Apple gave was the best that it could come up with at the time with the information that it had.

On the flip side, if Apple reports a better-than-expected product mix, then analysts and investors might go a little bit nuts in revising their expectations upward, which increases the odds that Apple will miss those projections and ultimately lead to investor disappointment.

Sometimes it's just best for companies to keep the details of their expectations private."
2017-11-14T16:27:08Z,"Last week, I talked about how I expected the Apple (AAPL) bear camp to soon come out talking about how this year's phone success will create a problem for Apple in 2018. With iPhone sales through the roof thanks to a three phone lineup highlighted by the X, phone revenues will help the company to a new corporate record for its top line. I asked the question how Apple could top this year's success next year, and although we are still basically 10 months from the next expected iPhone reveal, part of the story may have already been revealed.

On Monday, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who probably makes the most predictions about upcoming Apple product launches, detailed his expectation for another three phone release lineup in 2018. The key takeaway is that Apple will go big next year, mostly through the elimination of the Home button, which allows for a greater screen to body ratio. We saw an example of that this year, where the iPhone 8 has a 65.4% screen to body ratio while the iPhone X is at 82.9%, per GSM Arena stats.

With Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) still being the only OLED supplier to Apple next year, but more OLED screen supply coming to Apple, this will result in two OLED devices, one being a 5.8 inch while the other will come in at 6.5 inches, the largest display ever for an iPhone. The third device will actually have a screen size between those at 6.1 inches, but will be a traditional LCD screen like the majority of iPhones have been.

Now it is hard to determine what the actual size of these phones will be at the moment even if we know the screen size. Apple will certainly be looking to get the screen to body ratio up, but we also don't know for instance how things like speakers or cameras may impact the overall device size. One thing is certain, and that is that if this KGI report is true, it will continue the trend of increasing iPhone screen size beyond what we've seen in the chart below.

The obvious question here was posed in the title of my article - how big is too big? Not every consumer is going to want a phone that's approaching the size of a brick, which is where we are certainly heading. The iPhone 8 Plus, for instance, also is 50% heavier than the original iPhone. Some of these larger screen non-Apple phones already are blowing well past 7.3 inches. To put that in perspective, a US dollar bill is 6.14 inches long, so take a dollar bill and basically add another 20%. That might not fit in many shirt or pants pockets.

While it certainly seems Apple is just going along with other phone makers and going bigger and bigger as we move forward, it brings up a key question about two other products for the company. Does this mean that the iPhone SE, which reportedly sold fairly well and is popular with people like me who don't like to carry around a giant phone, is going to be eliminated? Additionally, since we are approaching 7-inch screen sizes in smartphones, does that finally mean the iPad mini is also going to be eliminated?

These two other products didn't get any real upgrades this year, but did get increases to their storage size. The iPad mini 4 has been on the market since late 2015, while the iPhone SE has been available since Spring 2016. If Apple does not upgrade either of these products in the next couple of quarters, it means that we are likely just going through the process of selling through the final inventory. It would not make sense to keep producing these two as is in too much volume beyond 2017 given how outdated their hardware is. I haven't received too many comments about the iPad mini, but I've heard from a fair number of people who like myself prefer the SE size and could use some upgraded internals.

So my question today for you is how big is too big? While I certainly understand the benefits of having a larger screen, especially for those who use the phone more for things like video, gaming, web browsing, and potentially multi-tasking (where available), there is a group of consumers that appreciate smaller devices. Monday's news of Apple's larger phone lineup would seem to explain how the company can up the ante next year, as it would likely increase phone prices to account for more expensive hardware. Thus, it won't need to match this year's unit sales bonanza, while still being able to achieve decent revenue growth."
2017-11-17T09:45:05-05:00,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly collaborating with Intel to built 5G modems for the upcoming iPhone. According to FastCompany, Apple engineers are in talks with their Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) counterparts regarding early work on the 5G iPhone.

Intel has reportedly deployed thousands of people to work on 5G technology to get a slice of the contract from Apple and to catch up with rival Qualcomm, report FastCompany, citing a source with knowledge of the matter. Further, the report states there has not been much dialogue between Qualcomm and Apple regarding 5G.

Intelâs announcement on Thursday lends some credibility to the report. On Thursday, the chipmaker announced that it has made âsubstantial advancesâ in the wireless product arena to accelerate the adoption of 5G. Intel noted that it has successfully completed an end-to-end 5G call based on early 5G silicon and sees it as a âkey milestone in its development.â

Qualcomm is believed to be an early leader in 5G technology. However, according to FastCompany, not many carriers are looking forward to Qualcommâs product. Further, Apple engineers seem to be single-minded when it comes to selecting between Qualcomm and Intel, as they believe Intelâs 5G modems fit the requirements for a future 5G iPhone.

FastCompanyâs report is in line with previous rumors that Apple is considering making iPhones and iPads without Qualcomm chips.

A 5G iPhone would be revolutionary, and thus, it is no surprise that Intel and Qualcomm are putting their best efforts into helping develop it. A 5G iPhone would be capable of connection speeds of a gigabit per second and beyond. It would transform our ways of computing, communication and consumption of content. However, the transition from existing tech to 5G is a complex process, and it requires better coordination between OEMs and potential vendors.

According to AppleInsider, Intelâs XMM 8060 chip for 5G networks will be available before the massive roll-out of 5G networks sometime in 2020. For Intel, supplying 5G modems to Apple would be a big win for its lagging modem division. Presently, the Cupertino, California-based company uses Intel modems for phones running on the T-Mobile and AT&T networks and Qualcomm chips for phones running on the Verizon and Sprint networks.

Shunning Qualcomm completely would be a big decision for Apple as the company relied heavily on Qualcomm modems up until the iPhone 7. After that, Apple started using a mix of chips from Intel and Qualcomm for the iPhone 7, iPhone 8 and iPhone X.

However, Appleâs ongoing dispute with Qualcomm could make it easier for it to decide on a modem supplier. Qualcomm recently fired off a lawsuit against Apple stating that the iPhone maker traded secret Qualcomm chip information with Intel. In the lawsuit, Qualcomm states that Apple got access to its software source after signing an agreement in 2010. Qualcomm stated that although the level of access was âunprecedented,â Apple said it was necessary, and therefore, the company agreed.

On Thursday, Intel shares closed up 0.42% at $45.65, while Apple shares closed up 1.19% at $171.10."
2017-11-13T17:16:00-05:00,"Bloomberg recently published an account detailing some of the key specifications of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) next iPad Pro tablet, slated to launch sometime in the second half of 2018.

Per a previous report from generally reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple intended to use an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display on the 2018 iPad Pro.

OLED displays offer some advantages over the liquid crystal display (LCD) technology used in the current iPad Pro displays, such as better contrast and faster pixel response times. However, according toÂ Bloomberg, Apple won't be using an OLED display in next year's iPad Pro after all.

Bloomberg says, citing ""a person with knowledge of Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) display operations,"" that it's not likely that Apple will use OLED displays on the next iPad Pro due to ""technical and financial constraints."" Samsung is the manufacturer of the OLED displays used on Apple's recently released iPhone X and is believed to be the only company currently capable of producing high-quality mobile OLED displays in substantial volumes.

The phrase ""technical and financial constraints"" is light on details, but I think I can fill those in.

Manufacturing good OLED displays is hard. Manufacturing OLED displays good enough for a next-generation iPad Pro is likely to be extremely hard.

For Apple to build an OLED display suitable for the iPad Pro, it'll need to work with its display partner -- almost certainly Samsung Display when it comes to anything OLED for now -- to solve several problems.

First, since Apple moved to a high refresh rate display with this year's iPad Pro models, it'd need to figure out how to bring that technology to large OLED displays while keeping power consumption in check.

If Apple can work that problem out in time, it'd still need to figure out how it plans to deliver an OLED display that's at least as sharp as the LCD found on the current iPad Pro. To do this, Apple would likely need to adopt an OLED panel that implements Samsung's S-Stripe sub-pixel pattern (in such a pattern each pixel has a unique red, green, and blue subpixel).

OLED displays implementing such a sub-pixel pattern, according to technology analyst Daniel Matte, are expensive to manufacture, which is why the iPhone X didn't use such a display panel. I also suspect that such a display would consume quite a bit of power, which would further add to the technology challenges that Apple and its display manufacturing partner would need to overcome.

Beyond simply building the appropriate technology, Apple would need to figure out how to build such displays in a cost-effective fashion. They would easily be far more expensive to produce than the one found on the iPhone X since it would be larger, use a more complex sub-pixel arrangement, and support high refresh rate.

A more expensive-to-produce display would be fine for a product that's commensurately more expensive, but the reality is that Apple doesn't charge for the iPad Pro what it does for the iPhone X.

The iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch display starts at $699 for the version with 64 GB of storage and goes to $1,129 for the variant with 512 GB of storage and cellular capability. The iPhone X, on the other hand, starts at $999 for models with 64 GB of storage and goes to $1,149 for versions with 256 GB of storage.

Of course, Apple's gross profit margins on its iPads are probably lower than those on its flagship iPhones, but it's quite likely that appropriate OLED displays for next year's iPads are still simply too expensive.

Apple is largely unchallenged in the premium tablet market, so the company's focus is likely on building products to get current iPad owners to upgrade to new models as well as to attract as many first-time iPad buyers as possible.

While deferring the transition to an OLED display to, perhaps, the 2019 iPad launch would be disappointing, the good news is that the rumored form factor change coupled with the addition of the TrueDepth camera for Face ID should be rather significant updates.

These changes alone might not be enough to convince those who bought the iPad Pro this year to upgrade again, but for owners of older-generation iPads, the improvements should be quite compelling."
2017-11-09T17:03:00-05:00,"During Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) most recent earnings call, analyst Steve Milunovich asked CEO Tim Cook about his view of Apple's ability to ""accelerate share gains from Android because [Apple is] now in a stronger competitive position.""

Milunovich is, of course, referring to the fact that Apple now has a device on the market -- the iPhone X -- that ticks all the right marketing checkboxes. It has a sharp, bright, and highly color-accurate organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, along with minimal bezels, best-in-class rear-facing cameras, and an innovative front-facing camera subsystem with 3D sensing capabilities.

There's nothing I can point to about the iPhone X that seems obviously dated or behind the competition. That's not something I could say about the iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, or, quite frankly, even the new iPhone 8 smartphones that launched alongside the iPhone X.

Tim Cook's response to this question was quite unusual.

Cook didn't concede that , perhaps, Apple's phones may have not been viewed as such clear leadership products in the past. Instead, he defended Apple's competitiveness across these product generations, telling Milunovich that he has ""maybe a different view than you do or the folks that you're quoting.""

""There's always doubting Thomases out there,"" Cook said. ""And I've been hearing those for the 20 years I've been here, and suspect I'll hear about them until I retire.""

The executive then defended Apple's workforce, saying that ""there's lots of fantastic people [at Apple] and they're doing unbelievable things.""

Is Cook right in his apparent disagreement with Milunovich that Apple's competitive positioning was weaker over the last few product cycles than it is now? Or is Milunovich right?

I'd say Milunovich is right, but with a caveat: Apple's competitive position during the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 generations was reasonably strong, but with some obvious gaps. For example, the bezels on the devices were relatively large, leaving Apple behind in screen-to-body ratio, and the company was slow to adopt OLED technology -- though, to be fair, Apple's LCDs, especially on the iPhone 7 series, were still excellent displays.

But in other ways, Apple led the pack. It has consistently delivered leading applications processors and camera performance, and it has introduced innovative new features such asÂ Touch IDÂ and 3D Touch. The rest of the industry copied the former, and the latter was innovative but didn't catch on as Apple may have hoped.

With this year's iPhones, those gaps are mostly closed, and next year, that positioning should strengthen further.

Though the iPhone X is clearly a leadership product, Apple's product portfolio this year isn't complete: It's missing a larger-screen iPhone X to cater to users who preferred Apple's previous-generation Plus-branded smartphones, as well as Android users who skew toward large-screen Android phones such as the Galaxy S8+ and the Galaxy Note8.

Once Apple brings such a product to market, the company's portfolio at the high end of the smartphone market should be practically bulletproof.

That's not to say customers will switch over to Apple products in droves because its portfolio is broader, though I do think that adding a larger iPhone X to the lineup will get some Android users to switch to iOS. What it will do is give users who prefer Apple and iOS but want larger screens a clear option: They won't be easily tempted by products from competitors.

However, I'd say that the lack of a larger-screen iPhone X is a relatively minor omission from the company's iPhone lineup this year, and such a device was probably not released because Apple may have had a hard time sourcing enough components -- OLED display, 3D sensing components, and so on.

Next year, Apple should have access to even greater OLED supply, which should make it easier for Apple to release such a device and ensure that it can manufacture them in large enough quantities to both launch the devices on time and in good supply."
2017-11-15T09:24:03-05:00,"Wall Street is seeing red this morning, as U.S. stock futures point to extended losses. The headline Dow Jones Industrial Average is headed toward triple-digit losses on the open, as tax plan worries and falling oil prices combined to push stocks lower. Crude was down more than 1% after the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise buildup in U.S. inventories.

Heading into the open, Dow futures were down 0.51%, S&P 500 futures had plunged 0.48% and Nasdaq-100 futures were lower by 0.41%.

On the options front, volume rebounded on Tuesday, with about 17.7 million calls and 12.9 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dipped to 0.62, with the 10-day moving average rose to a one-month high of 0.65.

As for Tuesdayâs options activity, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) was active after the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) launched an investigation into allegations of patent infringement. Meanwhile, JD.com Inc(ADR) (NASDAQ: ) drew heavy call volume despite a downgrade from Morgan Stanley. Finally, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) dividend capture plays were everywhere yesterday ahead of the companyâs ex-dividend date.

Apple is once again at the center of a patent dispute, but this time the USITC is getting involved. The agency said it was following up on complaints from Aqua Connect Inc and Strategic Technology Partners of Orange, California. According to the USITC, it is investigating patents related to certain Apple Mac computers, iPhones, iPads, iPods and Apple TVs.

The negative press comes at a bad time for AAPL stock. The shares are retreating from recent highs near $175, and AAPLâs decline yesterday took the shares below support at their 10-day moving average. Todayâs heavy market selling threatens to push AAPL back below $170.

AAPL options traders donât appear too worried, however. Volume on Tuesday topped 363,000 contracts, with calls accounting for an above-average 64% of the dayâs take. December, meanwhile, is thick with call open interest.

Currently the back-month put/call OI ratio comes in at 0.48, with calls more than doubling puts heading into the final expiration month of 2017. Peak call OI for December totals nearly 52,000 contracts at the overhead $180 strike."
2017-10-31T20:06:00-04:00,"When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports its quarterly results this week -- just before the holiday season -- the tech giant's guidance for the upcoming quarter may ultimately be the most important metric for investors to watch. Not only representing the holiday period, but also the period in which sales of the latest iPhones usually gain steam, the company's fiscal first quarter (the fourth calendar quarter) is seasonally its biggest -- by a long shot.

In Apple's first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Mac maker will be up against record quarterly revenue reported in the year-ago quarter after the iPhone 7 was released. The question, therefore, is whether Apple will provide guidance for first-quarter revenue above its top line in the first quarter of fiscal 2017?

The guidance Apple provides in its fourth-quarter earnings report for its first quarter is arguably more important than usual this year since Apple's launch schedule for its new iPhones follows a much different pattern than usual this time around.

Typically, Apple begins shipping all of its new iPhones before its fourth quarter ends. This year, however, Apple announced both its iPhone 8 and iPhone X in September, but only shipped iPhone 8 before the quarter ended. iPhone X shipments don't begin until Nov. 3 -- more than a month into the holiday quarter. Not only does this leave less time for customers to buy the iPhone X, but the later ship date is also an indicator of the flagship iPhone's limited supply. If Apple were able to ramp up iPhone X production earlier, the company would have shipped the iPhone X alongside the iPhone 8.

Since the iPhone X didn't start shipping until November, Apple may not ramp up iPhone X shipments fast enough to match itsÂ production of new iPhones during the holiday quarter in previous years, particularly when compared to Apple's record holiday quarter last year. Indeed, Apple's website currently says that iPhone X units ordered today won't ship for five to six weeks,Â suggesting production is already running behind demand.

Of course, there are still ways Apple could report a record holiday quarter. First, the iPhone 8 could potentially save the day. Currently, iPhone 8 orders are shipping as early as Thursday, Nov. 2.Â If there is enough demand for the iPhone 8, this could offset any production shortages from the iPhone X. Second, iPhone X production and shipments could ramp up nicely toward the end of the quarter. Last, Apple's other segments could contribute exceptionally strong growth. Notably, though iPhone represents half of Apple's revenue, other segments are growing faster.

Revenue in Apple's first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $78.4 billion, up 2.5% from revenue in the first fiscal quarter of 2016. So, when Apple provides its guidance for first-quarter revenue in its fourth-quarter report, the midpoint of the guidance range will need to be higher than $78.4 billion to imply that management expects growth.

However, for Apple's guidance to meet the market's expectations, the midpoint of Apple's guidance range will need to be about $85 billion, representing year-over-year growth of about 9%. On average, this is what analysts are expecting from Apple's first-quarter revenue. In other words, analysts seem to be betting that between a ramp-up in iPhone X production, sales of the company's September-launched iPhone 8, and growth in other Apple segments, more strong growth is on the way.

Apple will report its first-quarter earnings after market close on Thursday, Nov. 2."
2017-11-07T20:45:00-05:00,"Ahead of the launch of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone X, there were many reports from numerous sources in both the press and financial-analyst community that Apple was trying to integrate a fingerprint scanner in the display of the device.

Those reports indicated that Apple was having significant trouble getting this technology to work and, ahead of the device's launch, Apple canned the feature, opting instead to rely solely on facial-recognition technology to replace Touch ID.

According to Apple hardware chief Dan Riccio in an interview with Mashable, these reports were all bogus.

""We spent no time looking at [putting] fingerprints on the back or through the glass or on the side,"" Riccio told Mashable, referring to the reports that indicated that Apple had considered all three of those options.

Apparently, these reports were bogus, because Apple wasn't making changes to the iPhone X's design when those reports said the company was.

Riccio indicated in the interview that Apple locked down the key specifications of the iPhone X all the way back in November 2016. This, the executive claimed, was ""very, very early,"" which indicates that Apple typically locks down the specifications of its iPhones later than November of the year before they're introduced.

So, Riccio says, Apple simply ""didn't have time"" to make the sorts of last-minute design changes that the numerous news reports claimed were being made.

If you take Riccio at his word that Apple never truly considered those alternatives to Face ID, then one thing becomes crystal clear: Apple sees Face ID as the future of biometric authentication for its devices.

Since I do take Riccio at his word, I think we'll see Apple continue to refine Face ID in the years ahead.

There are obvious improvements that Apple can make to the technology. For example, many reports peg the speed of Face ID at slightly slower than the second-generation Touch ID technology found inside the iPhone 6s, 7, and 8, but faster than the first-generation Touch ID that made its debut in the iPhone 5s and was recycled in the iPhone 6.

Making the technology faster, then, may be a priority for Apple. My guess is that Apple will be able to deliver a speed increase by improving on the capabilities of the Apple Neural Engine, which is found in Apple's A11 Bionic chip.

Apple says the Apple Neural Engine is key to handling the processing requirements of Face ID. If Apple dramatically improves the performance of the Neural Engine with next year's model, then that could lead to a dramatic reduction in Face ID unlock time in the next iPhone.

On top of that, Apple could work to try to work on conquering some of the edge cases that this year's implementation of Face ID doesn't handle that well. According to several reviews, Face ID has trouble with the following scenarios:

Apple could try to work around the first issue by introducing another form of biometric authentication that works seamlessly in concert with Face ID. Iris scanning would probably do the trick, as identical twins still have unique irises and retinas. It's not clear to me how Apple would work around the second issue, but that's what Apple's engineers are paid to figure out.

The point, though, is this: Face ID seems awesome, but Apple would be silly to not aggressively work on the first generation of the technology, especially if it wants to maintain a lead over the competition."
2017-11-03T08:55:00-04:00,"Well, don't I feel foolish (lowercase ""f""). I fully expected Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to report a disappointing quarter, both because it seemed possible that guidance for the September quarter could have been issued before Apple was aware of iPhone X production delays, and a constant string of reports from supply chain sources and Street analysts suggested the production problems were rather severe.

It turns out that neither of those were the case: Apple just reportedÂ a record September quarter and guided the December quarter to uncharted territory.

Revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter jumped 12% to $52.6 billion, beating even the high end of Apple's guidance that called for $52 billion in sales. That translated into net income of $10.7 billion by the time it reached the bottom line, or $2.07 per share. Apple sold 46.7 million iPhones, 10.3 million iPads, and 5.4 million Macs.

iPhone average selling prices (ASPs) increased modestly on a sequential basis, from $606 in the June quarter to $618 in the September quarter as models at both ends of the pricing spectrum continue to sell well. On the conference call, CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone X ramp is ""going well,"" especially considering that it's the most advanced iPhone Apple has ever made.

The Mac enjoyed significant share gains, with unit sales jumping 10% while the broader PC market contracted by 0.5%, accordingÂ to IDC. The MacBook Pro refresh over the summer is driving sales.

Over the past couple of years, Apple's Greater China has been relatively weak, with a string of quarterly declines. That ended this quarter, with Greater China revenue returning to growth. Sales rose 12% to $9.8 billion.

Cook said the strength was broad-based across all products, while services revenue hit a new record in China. Both upgraders and Android switchers in China were up year over year, too. The troubles Apple has been facing in Hong Kong also moderated, and Cook acknowledged that the recent quarters of weakness paved the way for an easier comparison this time around.

Earlier this year, Apple publicly set a goal of doubling its services business by 2020, relative to fiscal 2016 levels. More specifically, the goal is to hit $50 billion by 2020.

Services revenue in the September quarter grew 34% to $8.5 billion, a new record. However, that includes a one-time positive adjustment of $640 million. If you back out this adjustment, services revenue still grew 24%. Services revenue in fiscal 2017 was $30 billion, up from $24.3 billion in fiscal 2016, so Apple is making meaningful progress toward its target.

The drivers of the services business are the same three usual suspects: the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. The App Store hit a new record, thanks to both a growing number of active accounts and increased transactions and spending among existing accounts. Apple now has over 210 million total paid subscriptions across its platforms, up from 185 million last quarter.

Management said Apple Music subscriptions are up 70% without specifying a figure, but Apple Music chief Jimmy Iovine told Billboard at the end of September (around the same time that this fiscal quarter closed) that the service now has 30 million paid subscribers.

There was nothing notable about Apple's capital return activities in the September quarter. The Mac maker returned $11 billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter, including $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents, $200 million in net share settlement, and $7.5 billion in share repurchases.

Of those buybacks, $4.5 billion were bought back in the open market, and Apple entered into a $3 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. To date, Apple has bought back a mind-boggling $166 billion in stock since fiscal 2013.

Total cash was $268.9 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $252 billion was sitting overseas. The company issued roughly $7 billion in term debt during the quarter, bringing total term debt to $103.7 billion. In other words, net cash is at $165.2 billion (flat sequentially).

Guidance was always going to be the most important part of the release, as the most direct insight into the iPhone X production situation. If the bottlenecks were as severe as media reports portrayed, it would show up clear as day in Apple's financial forecast in the form of depressed sales outlook. In no uncertain terms, Apple's outlook blew it out of the park: Revenue is expected in the range of $84 billion to $87 billion, simultaneously topping the consensus estimate among analysts and assuaging fears surrounding iPhone X production.

Gross margin in the December quarter should be in the range of 38% to 38.5%, with operating expenses of $7.65 billion to $7.75 billion. Other income and expense should be about $600 million, and Apple is expecting a tax rate of 25.5%. Using the midpoints of all of those ranges, the forecast implies net income of over $18.1 billion in the December quarter.

I've never been so pleasantly surprised to be so wrong."
2017-11-14T00:37:56Z,"Apple (AAPL) stock has produced extraordinary returns for investors over the long term. Shares of the iPhone maker have gained nearly 780% in the past decade on the back of spectacular financial performance from the company.



However, at current prices Apple is the biggest corporation on Earth, with a gargantuan market capitalization of more than $900 billion. The smartphone industry is maturing, and growth tends to naturally slow down as a company gains size over time.

This raises an important question for investors: Is it too late to buy Apple stock or does it still offer attractive potential for returns going forward?

When trying to understand what Apple has to offer to investors at current prices, it makes sense to think in terms of valuation, embedded expectations, and the companyâs ability to meet or exceed such expectations.

At the end of the day, valuations reflect market expectations about the future of a business. When a stock is priced at moderate levels, this means that expectations are quite reasonable for the company. If the business can exceed those expectations, this usually means above-average returns for investors in such company. Conversely, even the best high-growth companies can turn out to be mediocre investments when valuations and expectations are unrealistically high.

Apple is currently trading at price to earnings ratio around 19. This is a discount versus a price to earnings ratio of 22 for the average company in the S&P 500 index. Based on earnings expectations for next year, the forward price to earnings for Apple stands at 14.5 in comparison to nearly 21 for companies in the S&P 500.

We can easily make the case that Apple is superior to the average stock in the S&P 500 when looking at variables such as business profitability and financial quality, so the stock looks conveniently priced when considering both fundamentals and valuation.

Offering a similar perspective, the following table compares valuation ratios for Apple versus other top players in the tech industry, such as Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT). The numbers are quite clear, and Apple is significantly cheaper than its peers across all of the indicators in the table - price to earnings, forward price to earnings, price to sales, and price to free cash flows.



Companies such as Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft are quite unique, so comparisons can be tricky. Nevertheless, it's hard to argue on the fact that Apple is fairly attractively valued, both in comparison to the average stock in the market and to other big and successful tech corporations.

One more thing, Apple is sitting on top of a mountain of cash. The company has nearly $270 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. This means that nearly 30% of the companyâs market value is currently supported by cash reserves alone, which makes valuation even more compelling.

Apple reported both sales and earnings figures above Wall Street expectations during the quarter ended in September, meaning the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 for the company. Total revenue came in at 52.6 billion, a 12% increase versus the same quarter in the prior year.

Importantly, Apple is delivering accelerating revenue growth in the last five consecutive quarters, and this is great news for investors in the company.

Profit margins also are expanding, so earnings are growing at a faster rate than revenue. Operating income grew 14% year-over-year last quarter. Since the company is aggressively reducing the share count via buybacks, this allows Apple to produce earnings per share growth in excess of net income growth. All said and done, the company announced a vigorous increase of 24% in earnings per share last quarter.

Moving forward, itâs good to know that Apple doesn't need to reinvent the wheel with every new iPhone model in order to drive revenue growth in this key segment. Besides, the services division looks like a particularly promising growth driver in the years ahead.

Apple generated $8.5 billion in revenue from services last quarter, an explosive increase of 35% vs. the same quarter a year ago. Just to make an illustrative comparison, Netflix (NFLX) generated $2.98 billion in revenue last quarter, growing by 30.3% year over year. In a nutshell, Appleâs services business is much bigger than Netflix, and itâs also growing at a faster rate.

The services business does not depend much on product sales in a particular quarter, the size of the installed base is much more important for this division. This should allow Apple to generate both higher growth rates and more predictable recurring revenue from services in the years ahead. Apple does not disclose profit margins for different segments, but it makes a lot of sense to assume that services typically generate higher profitability than hardware sales.

The company also is making big bets on powerful technologies such as augmented reality and machine learning. According to CEO Tim Cook, the launch of iOS 11 made iOS the world's largest platform for AR, and there are more than 1,000 apps with AR features in the App Store nowadays.

Developers are also leveraging on iOS 11 to integrate Machine Learning models into their apps with Core ML. In the words of Tim Cook:



When thinking about risk factors there are multiple variables to consider, and product concentration is particularly relevant. The company makes nearly two thirds of revenue from the iPhone, if Apple makes a serious mistake in this product, or the competition manages to steal customers away from Apple, then this would be a major negative for the stock. Apple operates in a remarkably dynamic and competitive industry, so investors need to watch the competitive landscape closely, especially in smartphones.

That said, considering valuation and the companyâs ability to deliver results, Apple still looks like an attractive investment in terms of risk versus potential rewards over the years ahead."
2017-11-09T09:16:00-05:00,"KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, whose track record of predicting the capabilities of future Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones is quite strong, recently made a somewhat troubling prediction about the company's 2018 iPhone models.

Kuo reportedly said that Apple will focus on ""reducing costs and selling prices"" of its next-generation iPhone X line while also working to deliver ""more product lines to attract more customers.""

Although the second part of Kuo's claim is good news -- a broader portfolio of iPhone X products could help boost shipments -- I'm a little uneasy about Kuo's claim that Apple will also work to cut production costs and selling prices.

Allow me to explain.

Perhaps the single biggest reason that this year's iPhone X is such a phenomenal product is that Apple boldly decided to target a higher selling price for it. This meant the economic constraints Apple traditionally faced in trying to build phones that can be sold for between $649 and $769 while also generating acceptable profits had been, to a large extent, lifted.

The higher selling price allowed Apple to use more advanced organic light-emitting diode displays, higher-quality stainless steel frames, and improved camera subsystems compared with what it could deliver in the cheaper iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.

If Apple continues to build phones targeting the iPhone X's price point, as well as potentially even higher price points, then it can deliver bigger, more interesting innovations at a faster clip.

The risk that Apple would face if it were to focus on cost reductions for next year's iPhones rather than on significantly beefing up the user experience is that it may simply bring out a less than ideal successor to this year's iPhone X.

Considering Apple will almost certainly enjoy a strong product cycle over the next year or so, the company is going to need to pull out all the stops for the 2018 iPhones to continue that growth momentum. Cost-cutting hinders product innovation.

In addition, considering that the smartphone market is seeing relatively anemic unit growth, it makes sense for Apple to focus on delivering more value per smartphone sold, meaning Apple can charge more for each phone.

I get it. Apple can't come to market with phones that start at $999 and only go up from there. Many smartphone buyers are already stretching their budgets to buy something like the iPhone 8, and Apple can't hang those buyers out to dry.

Here's what Apple should do, then. The iPhone X line should remain a premium line. Next year's 5.8-inch iPhone X should still start at $999, and the rumored 6.46-inch iPhone X should start somewhere north of that.

For more cost-sensitive buyers, Apple should sell another product line, known simply as iPhone. Apple is rumored to be planning an iPhone with a 6-inch liquid crystal display next year, which I suspect will serve as Apple's lower-cost flagship.

Apple may want to consider offering two models in this line next year to cover even more of the market, but Apple could use price-reduced versions of this year's iPhone 8 and 8 Plus to handle those price points instead.

In essence, Apple should continue to deliver great iPhones at familiar price points, but it should continue relentlessly innovating at higher price points as well."
2017-11-06T16:36:00-05:00,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) earned a straight A from investors when it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results last week. Accelerating revenue growth and massive guidance highlighted strong performance and big growth potential.

But there was more to the quarter than the key metrics. During Apple's fourth-quarter earnings call, management discussed demand for its just-launched iPhone X, the drivers behind Mac sales, its wearables business, and more. Here's a look at the most insightful takeaways from the earnings call.

When asked about the specific mix of iPhone orders Apple is receiving by model, Apple CEO Tim Cook wouldn't cave. ""[W]e never go through mix,"" he told the analyst. But Cook did comment on the overall solid demand for Apple's newest iPhone, the iPhone X:

But I would share with you that the iPhone X orders are very strong for both direct customers and for channel partners, which, as you know, are lots of carrier throughout the world. And we couldn't be more excited to get underway.

When measured by revenue, Mac was Apple's third-largest segment in the quarter, behind iPhone and services. Notably, fiscal 2017 proved to be the best year ever for Mac. In addition, Mac sales were up an impressive 25% year over year in Q4.

But what, exactly, were the main drivers behind Apple's impressive growth in Mac sales? Apple CFO Luca Maestri explained:

This performance was fueled primarily by great demand for MacBook Pro ... We had outstanding results all around the world with each of our geographic segments, growing Mac revenue by 20% or more. We are also very happy with the success of Mac in the education market, where customer purchases grew double digits year-over-year.

Apple doesn't break out Apple Watch sales in its operating data. Instead, it lumps them in with the company's other products revenue, which was up 36% year over year -- making other products Apple's fastest-growing segment. Based on the segment's rapid growth, investors would assume Apple Watch is doing well.

Fortunately, however, investors don't have to play a guessing game. During Apple's earnings call, Cook said Apple Watch sales have been rising sharply:

Cook was pleased with the Watch's success enough to conclude that adding cellular connectivity with the Apple Watch 3 Series has been a ""game changer.""

If Apple does eventually begin breaking out Apple Watch sales into a more specific product segment, it will likely call it wearables. And Apple will likely opt to include sales of AirPods, and any other future wearable technology it sells, alongside Apple Watch. After all, Cook is already providing data on wearables as a category -- and the segment is looking good:

Apple's earnings call provided further support for a bullish investment thesis for the tech giant. With strong demand for its latest iPhone, healthy Mac sales, and promising growth in newer product segments, there's plenty of reasons for Apple's growth to remain strong in the years ahead."
2017-11-17T15:52:55+0000,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Alphabet Incâs Google said it has bought a plot of land in southern Denmark adjacent to a planned Apple Inc data center to make sure it has the option of building one there too.

Apple said in July it would spend around $950 million to build a center with a planned opening in 2019. If Google follows suit it would make the area one of the worldâs largest data center hubs, the local municipality Aabenraa said.

âIt signals that Google has plans in Denmark, and I think itâs because we have some of Europeâs lowest power prices for companies, some of the greenest energy, and a high security of supply,â he said in a telephone interview.

Facebook in January announced plans to build a data center in Odense in central Denmark, its third outside of the United States.

Besides its new 131 hectare (324 acres) plot in Aabenraa Google also owns a 73 plot in Fredericia, 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Aabenraa.

Google has no plans for the lots yet, but wanted to secure the possibility to expand its data centers in Europe if required, a spokeswoman told Reuters."
2017-11-06T07:10:00-05:00,"A little more than three years ago, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, its first large-screen phones. These devices helped power Apple to a $51 billion (or 28%) year-over-year revenue increase in its 2015 fiscal year. Meanwhile, earnings per share surged 43%, from $6.45 to $9.22.

The recent launch of the iPhone X could have a similarly powerful effect on Apple's revenue and earnings during the 2018 fiscal year, which began last month. However, there's one important difference between now and fiscal 2015: Apple is poised for strong growth in its other product lines this year, whereas it was much more of a one-trick pony three years ago.

As noted, Apple added a stunning $51 billion to its top line in fiscal 2015. What makes this revenue growth especially remarkable is that it was driven singlehandedly by the iPhone product line.

In fact, Apple's non-iPhone revenue totaled $78.7 billion in fiscal 2015, down from $80.8 billion a year earlier. A 23% plunge in iPad revenue more than offset gains in the Mac, services, and other-products segments. On the flip side, iPhone sales surged more than 50% year over year, from $102.0 billion to $155.0 billion.

The weakness in Apple's non-iPhone revenue continued beyond fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, non-iPhone revenue was flat year over year. Accelerating growth from the services business in particular couldn't quite make up for double-digit declines in iPad and Mac revenue. Non-iPhone revenue also decreased modestly during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

More recently, Apple has gotten all the pieces of its business moving in the right direction. In the second quarter, non-iPhone revenue rose 11% year over year, despite yet another double-digit drop in iPad revenue. In the third quarter, the growth rate accelerated to 12%, as even iPad revenue turned positive on a year-over-year basis.

On Thursday, Apple reported that non-iPhone revenue surged last quarter, rising 27% year over year. (Excluding a one-time $640 million revenue adjustment in Apple's services business, revenue would have increased by 24%.) On a full-year basis, iPhone revenue increased by 3% -- mainly driven by an extra week in the 2017 fiscal year -- whereas revenue from the rest of the company jumped by 11%.

Apple's iPhone revenue over the past year was still 9% below the peak reached two years earlier, during the massively successful iPhone 6 product cycle. However, demand for the pricey iPhone X, which starts at $999, appears to be very strong. As a result, this year Apple is poised to smash through the record of $155 billion in iPhone revenue that was established in fiscal 2015.

Meanwhile, Apple is well positioned to achieve another double-digit gain in non-iPhone revenue during the coming year. Most importantly, the services business is gaining traction and posted its fastest growth of the year last quarter. Based on that segment's recent growth rate, Apple could add $7 billion or more in services revenue this year.

The ""other products"" segment could also take off in fiscal 2018, thanks to the recent launch of the cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 3, and to a lesser extent the Apple TV 4K. There are also hopeful signs that iPad sales could continue to rebound as consumers replace older devices and enterprise adoption rises. Lastly, the Mac product line probably can't duplicate the 13% revenue gain it achieved last year, but a recent product refresh should drive continued growth.

In short, whereas non-iPhone revenue fell by $2 billion in fiscal 2015, it is likely to rocket higher by more than $10 billion this year, perhaps eclipsing the $100 billion mark. The combination of a strong iPhone cycle and growth across the rest of Apple's product lines should drive stellar revenue and earnings growth for Apple in fiscal 2018."
2017-11-10T05:01:24-05:00,"Weâve all known that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) would eventually make a push into content. It already has, although admittedly, itâs been a toe-dip at best. AAPL stock is down slightly thanks to the broader market pullback Thursday. But letâs not overlook the new deal it just announced.

A new drama series featuring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston is in the works. While we donât know the terms of the programming deal, costs could run in excess of $10 million per episode. For a company like Apple, thatâs less than a drop in the bucket â this company generated $10.7 billion in net income last quarter alone. Reportedly, Apple beat out Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) and CBS Corporationâs (NYSE: ) Showtime for the âhighly sought after show.â

Weâve seen a big shift in retail thanks to e-commerce, led by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: ). Well that very shift is happening in content consumption, too. It shows why AT&T Inc. (NYSE: ) wants Time Warner Inc (NYSE: ) for its content and HBO assets. It shows why Walt Disney Co (NYSE: ) may be trying to buy Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (NASDAQ: ).

AT&T already owns DirecTV, which is feeling cord-cutting pressure. Disney wants to bulk up its content and studio offerings. After all, content is king.

But my question has always been, what happens to these guys â and Netflix, which is spending as much as $8 billion on content next year â when Apple gets involved? What happens when Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: ) gets involved with its Watch platform?

To an extent, weâve seen it with Amazon, but there havenât been any repercussions. But I ask about FB and AAPL simply because of their size. For example, if they wanted to control live sports content, they could. Movies, TV and originals, too. Maybe theyâll be content with just being the distribution platform â iPads, iPhones and Facebookâs Watch. But if its content they want, it could have big implications for content andÂ distribution companies.

I donât know how long it will take to see this shift or even if it will ultimately happen. But in my eyes, Apple just took its first real step toward joining the content game. Should it get more involved, it will raise plenty of questions. It obviously has a huge ecosystem to leverage, be it mobile devices or at-home devices like Apple TV. With almost a billion iTunes users, it also has the customer preference and credit card data it needs.

I think this is why Netflix is spending so much on content. Itâs producing its own shows and movies because others with far deeper pockets are looming. Even if FB or AAPL donât meaningfully get into the game, others like HBO and Disney are looking to their own solutions. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: ) also has a pretty solid $35/month offering for YouTubeTV. But itâs unclear if YouTubeTV is a threat or a complement to Netflix at this point. It is clear, though, that everyone is chasing Netflix right now."
2017-11-14T19:43:23Z,"For the first time in over a year, our two more aggressive model portfolios include allocations to U.S. small and mid-cap ETFs. We still project better returns for U.S. large-cap stocks, but the recent run in foreign developed and emerging market equities has shaved off future return potential for those sectors and improved the diversification benefit of smaller-cap U.S. stocks. If the rally in global equity continues to compress the returns offered vs. U.S. stocks we would expect our average risk tolerance portfolio and perhaps even our more conservative model portfolios to eventually include U.S. smaller cap holdings as well.



But the worldâs biggest cap company, Apple (AAPL), still merits a place in investor portfolios - either directly or via a market-weighted fund. Our latest earnings model for AAPL pegs fair value at $182. As with all of our analyses, we take a long view of the fundamentals. Our valuation incorporates a quickly maturing hardware business bolstered by a still fast-growing services segment. However, we estimate that the services businesses in aggregate have a much lower profit margin than hardware sales. AAPL doesnât disclose gross profit by segment, but based upon comparable margins and hardware product pricing we estimate that the services segment gross profit margin is in the low to mid teens. This is well below what some analysts have projected. Perhaps the accounting for Appleâs revenue share for items like app store sales enable higher reported margins, but these services businesses are primarily a) dependent upon content produced by third parties (e.g., music, apps, video), or b) a commodity (e.g., cloud storage, payments). Apple has proven that customers will pay a premium price for their devices, but we think the idea that they will pay a premium on content and applications for the privilege of consuming these through AAPL is a bridge too far. And the gross margin trend over the past two years pokes a hole in the thesis that growth in services will drive gross margin expansion. 



We forecast that AAPL will see operating and bottom line profit growth of just 1-1.5% annually over the longer term as faster growth in services causes modest margin compression. Nevertheless, given an estimated cost of equity capital of 6.8% for U.S. large-cap cyclical stocks (including 2% for inflation), AAPLâs operations are worth an estimated $154 per share. And recent tax reform bills suggest repatriation rates for companies with hoards of overseas cash will be quite favorable - our model now assumes a 12% tax rate on foreign cash and securities. Adding cash worth $27 per share gets us to a fair value of $182 for AAPL. Incredibly, we estimate that shares are at worst fairly priced despite a recent stock rally driven by dubious expectations of sustained revenue growth acceleration.



The overall risk profiles of our model portfolios are flat or slightly lower m/m as equity risk premia declined across the board. Allocation changes varied m/m depending upon the level of risk tolerance targeted. However, most portfolios saw a second straight month of reductions in foreign developed stock holdings as higher stock prices combined with a slightly weaker earnings forecast (in U.S. dollars) to dampen prospective returns for that group.

Fixed income maturities have been lengthened for all but the most conservative model portfolio. In addition, slightly greater credit risk has been assumed in most model portfolios. Most of this shift is attributable to the declining attraction of equity as our outlook for fixed income is little changed apart from slightly higher estimated credit risk premia for corporate bonds.



Our optimal portfolio for an investor with average risk tolerance includes a 55% allocation to equity, down 2 percentage points m/m. Non-cyclical equity exposure is down 2 points m/m, while cyclical equity exposure is unchanged. This shift seems counterintuitive given that most of the rally in U.S. equity prices came from cyclical sectors in October. However, recent price movements in foreign stocks have been more uniform and the reduction in the prospective foreign developed non-cyclical equity return is higher in percentage terms than return outlook changes for U.S. equity.



Short-term bond holdings for the investor with average risk tolerance are unchanged, but exposure to intermediate and long-term bonds is 3 points higher. TIPS holdings declined by one point.



Projected U.S. large-cap equity returns are lower following another 2% return for the S&P 500 in October. Information technology stocks surged 7% and financials added another 3% to drive most of the gains for the index.



Our forecast for U.S. large-cap equity returns implies average annual mid-cycle earnings of ~$123 for the S&P 500 index companies, unchanged from our prior estimate. This earnings outlook compares to the consensus bottoms-up forecast of ~$138 over the next four quarters for S&P 500 earnings.



The gap between the projected returns of cyclical and non-cyclical U.S. large cap equity is a scant 10 bp for a second straight month. The last time this gap was less than 20 bp was in the wake of a sharp surge in U.S. stock prices in early 2014.



The Russell 2000 was up 1% in October, driving slightly lower projected returns m/m for U.S. small and mid-cap equity.



We have included U.S. small and mid-cap funds in our most aggressive model portfolios for the first time since October 2016 as lower projected returns in foreign developed and emerging market equity have boosted the relative diversification benefit of smaller cap U.S. stocks.



The projected return for foreign developed large-cap equity is lower m/m as higher stock prices (the MSCI EAFE Index was up 1.5% in October) are coupled with lower forecast earnings. The earnings outlook deteriorated due to a 2% weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar.



The estimated 120 bp premium offered by foreign-developed cyclical equity over U.S. cyclical equity is above the average of 85 bp over the past five years. Our model portfolios continue to favor foreign developed over U.S. cyclical equity, though foreign developed equity holdings have declined in recent months.



The return outlook for emerging markets large-cap cyclical equity is lower m/m following a 3.5% gain for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in October. The 130 bp return premium offered by emerging markets over U.S. equity is below the three-year average of 170 bp, and the 10 bp return premium over foreign-developed cyclical equity is now well below the three-year average of 80 bp.

Projected real fixed income returns are little changed m/m as the forward U.S. TIP curve has held steady. Our estimate of credit risk premia has ticked higher, boosting expected returns for corporate paper slightly.



The estimated real term premium offered for 10-year U.S. Treasury (UST) bonds is down 5 bp m/m. A 10-year UST note purchased in five years offers 26 bp of additional return over a 52-week UST bill. This level is below the 10-year average real term premium of 56 bp.



The estimated inflation risk premium is 3 bp lower m/m for a 15-year bond. The inflation premium remains below 20 bp for the 25th consecutive month as bond markets continue to imply a significant possibility of disinflation. 



We estimate that investors in investment grade corporate bonds are receiving ~8 bp of return for every year to maturity as compensation for credit risk, up 1 bp from a month ago. The current credit risk premium is above the five-year average of 5 bp for every year to maturity.

"
2017-11-06T13:44:00-05:00,"Like clockwork, every time Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) domestic cash position dwindles to near $15 billion, it promptly conducts a bond offering in order to fill its coffers to continue its aggressive capital return program. Just days after reporting a blockbuster fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release, the company has signaled its intention to tap the debt markets yet again.

Apple filed a preliminary prospectus this morning for the offering, which is currently expected to include six tranches. The Mac maker has not yet specified the size of the offering and the interest rates have also not been determined yet.

The notes will come due in November 2019, November 2020, January 2023, January 2025, November 2027, and November 2047. Bloomberg reports that the 2047 notes may price with a spread of around 1.125% over comparable Treasury bonds. For reference, 30-year Treasury bonds are currently yielding around 2.8%, which suggests Apple's 30-year notes may price around 3.925%. Here's how that potential rate would compareÂ to other Apple bonds that mature after 2040.

Apple raised approximately $7 billion worth of debt last quarter, which included $2 billion in its first Canadian bond offering that was followed by $5 billion in September. Total term debt on Apple's balance sheet now stands at $103.7 billion, in addition to approximately $12 billion in commercial paper.

After repurchasing $7.5 billion worth of stock last quarter, which includedÂ $4.5 billion in open market purchases and a $3 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program, Apple has bought back $166 billion out of its $210 billion repurchase authorization. That authorization was boosted from $175 billion to $210 billion in May alongside fiscal second-quarter earnings; Apple updates its capital return program on an annual basis around April or May of each year.

Over the past year, the chances of some type of tax reform that includes more favorable repatriation rates has increased significantly. Republicans unveiled a tax bill last week that includesÂ a significantly lower one-time repatriation rate of 12% on all foreign cash. Being the largest hoarder of foreign cash in the world by far, Apple potentially stands to be the greatest beneficiary if the bill were to pass. The company now holds $252.3 billion (94% of total cash) overseas.

Apple has lobbied for tax reform for years, with CEO Tim Cook arguing that the current 35% repatriation rate is far too high. Cook has said that Apple would gladly bring some of that cash home for domestic investment (and capital returns) if only the repatriation rate was ""reasonable."" The chief executive has previously saidÂ a rate in the ""single digits"" would be reasonable, but more recently acknowledgedÂ that 15% to 20% may be more likely.

But Apple's capital return program can't wait on congressional action. It needs that domestic cash now."
2017-11-07T17:00:00-05:00,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) filed a preliminary prospectus for a bond offering yesterday morning. It wasn't clear at the time how much Apple was raising, but the company has now filed a final pricing sheet with the SEC that details how the offering priced and how much Apple ended up raising.

The company now has nearly $111 billion in term debt on the balance sheet.

Unlike in some prior offerings, there were no floaters this time around; it was all fixed-rate notes. Here's a breakdown of all the tranches:

That adds up to $7 billion in fresh paper that the Mac maker has just issued, which is comparable in size to prior offerings. Apple raised $7 billion across two separate offerings in the September quarter. The company finished the September quarter with $103.7 billion in total term debt, so this offering brings that figure up to approximately $110.7 billion and will help fund another quarter's worth of capital returns.

Apple returnedÂ $11 billion to shareholders last quarter, including $7.5 billion in repurchases, $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $200 million of net share settlements. Domestic operating cash flow should help cover the rest, and we know that the December quarter is likely to be a monster, with sales expected in the range of $84 billion to $87 billion. Most of those sales will occur internationally, but Apple will only need a few more billion dollars in domestic operating cash flow to cover its capital return activities this quarter.

That's an awful lot of debt to service, and interest expenses continue to rise in lockstep. Here's the thing: Apple's massive investment portfolio has long covered these costsÂ and continues to do so. For example, interest and dividend income in fiscal 2017 totaledÂ $5.2 billion, more than enough to pay for the $2.3 billion in interest expense.

Apple has never had net negative interest expenses, and won't for the foreseeable future since there's still a meaningful cushion between interest and dividend income and interest expense."
2017-10-24T18:06:00-04:00,"It's that time of the year again when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) brings the spotlight to earnings season. The world's most valuable publicly traded company is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Thursday, Nov. 2.

Following the introduction of the new iPhones and updated versions of its Apple Watch and Apple TV, investors will have a lot of questions. Hopefully, the quarterly update will provide some answers.

Here are three key metrics investors should check on after Apple's fourth-quarter numbers go live.

As usual, total revenue will be an important metric to watch. Apple investors are particularly sensitive to the tech giant's revenue trends as it was only the first fiscal quarter of this year when the company returned to revenue growth after suffering a period of decline.

For its fourth quarter, Apple guided for revenue to be between $49 billion to $52 billion.Â This compares to revenue of $46.9Â billion in the year-ago quarter. So, the midpoint of its guidance calls for year-over-year revenue growth of 7.7%, slightly better than the 7% year-over-year revenue increase in Q3.

Given that Apple's guidance typically proves to be conservative, investors should look for fourth-quarter revenue to be at the high end of this range.

Since iPhone accounts for over half of Apple's revenue, guidance for total revenue growth implies that management also likely expects growth in iPhone revenue. But some analysts have expressed concerns about iPhone sales during the quarter since the flagship iPhone X isn't available until November.

But I suspect management had enough visibility into its supply chain to anticipate a delayed iPhone X launch. In other words, I believe Apple's revenue guidance for the quarter already takes into account the timing of the iPhone launch. So, management likely expected revenue from its new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus to contribute enough during the quarter for the company to grow iPhone revenue on a year-over-year basis -- without the help of iPhone X.

I'm expecting low single-digit revenue growth from the iPhone, with Apple's services and other products segments playing aÂ meaningful role in helping to achieve its guidance for overall revenue.

In Apple's fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, iPhone revenue was about $28.2 billion. This quarter, look for it to be close to $29.3 billion, up about 4% year over year.

Apple's gross profit margin comes back into the spotlight every year after an iPhone launch. Some iPhone models have higher initial costs than other iPhone models, so it's interesting to see how new iPhones are impacting overall profitability. While the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were only available for nine days during the quarter, they could have some influence on the company's gross profit margin.

Fourth-quarter gross profit margin is expected to come between 37.5% and 38%. This compares to a gross margin of 38% in the year-ago quarter.

But the most interesting aspect of Apple's fourth-quarter earnings release to watch when it comes to gross profit margin is the guidance for its first-quarter gross profit margin. Since the iPhone X is scheduled to launch on Nov. 3, investors will likely see management's expectations for the phone's profitability reflected in the gross profit margin guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Â For a benchmark, Apple's gross profit margin in its first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 38.5%."
2017-11-08T13:29:00-05:00,"Beginning with the iPhone 7-series smartphones last year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) started to dual-source cellular modems from both Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) after relying exclusively on Qualcomm for years.

This led to a drop in Qualcomm's stand-alone cellular modem shipments and a new lifeline for Intel's efforts to break into the market for cellphone chips.

Intel's modems, per third party tests, were inferior to Qualcomm's in terms of real-world performance as well as carrier support (Intel-based iPhones don't work on CDMA networks), but they were good enough so that the average user didn't notice or care.

Apple continued its dual-sourcing strategy with this year's iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X smartphones, once again opting to use modems from Qualcomm and Intel. A recent set of reports from The Wall Street Journal and Reuters claim that Apple may design Qualcomm completely out of next year's iPhones, something that would deal another blow to Qualcomm's modem business and further boost Intel's.

Though the reason that many cite for Apple potentially opting to shift away from Qualcomm is due to the ongoing intellectual property litigation between the two companies, I think there's a bigger strategic reason that a lot of people are missing.

Qualcomm is widely known as the leading vendor of chips that power Android-based smartphones. Most smartphone vendors don't have the financial wherewithal, let alone sound business justification, to build their own applications processors as Apple does. Those vendors lean heavily on Qualcomm making better applications processors, which are branded Snapdragon, to allow them to build competitive smartphones.

Much of the key functionality of a smartphone is directly dependent on the capabilities of the various technologies integrated into the applications processor. The general speed and fluidity of the user experience, the quality of the camera subsystem, battery life, and much more are directly impacted by the technologies found in these processors. Qualcomm commoditizes this technology, making it easy for virtually any smartphone vendor to gain access to some of the most advanced smartphone chip technology on earth without having to invest billions in research and development.

What I think many investors miss, though, is that Qualcomm doesn't just sell processors and some related software to these smartphone vendors. Qualcomm often does much of the heavy lifting in terms of the phone's design, which is how small, relatively unknown smartphone vendors can put out devices that can compete with phones put out by much larger vendors.

Additionally, Qualcomm continues to grow its portfolio of complementary smartphone platform technologies. For instance, Qualcomm is now marketing a broad range of fingerprint scanners, marketed as Snapdragon Sense ID, to smartphone vendors. Qualcomm's portfolio of fingerprint scanners includes everything from low-end scanners that can be embedded in home buttons all the way to scanners that can be embedded directly into the display.

Beyond that, Qualcomm is also being quite vocal about its work to develop 3D sensing technology like Apple's new TrueDepth camera technology. Once Qualcomm gets this technology off the ground, the proverbial floodgates will be open and smartphone makers hoping to copy the signature feature of Apple's iPhone X will have an easy time doing so.

The point is this: Qualcomm is one of the key enablers of the commoditization of the technologies that Apple brings to market, which allows companies with only a fraction of Apple's resources to go head-to-head with Apple. I suspect Apple believes that by cutting Qualcomm out as much as it reasonably can, it'll reduce Qualcomm's ability to invest in chip and other platform technologies that'll ultimately be used against it in the marketplace.

Since Intel's only real exposure to the smartphone market is through the sale of cellular modem chips to Apple, Intel is far less of a threat to Apple's core iPhone business than Qualcomm is.

Intel, of course, does work in the PC market to enable competitors to Apple's Mac and, to some extent, iPad product lines, but even the combination of Apple's Mac and iPad businesses isn't anywhere near the size of Apple's iPhone business. This likely makes it far more palatable for Apple to give billions of dollars' worth of cellular modem business to Intel instead of Qualcomm."
2017-11-08T12:13:00-05:00,"During Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) fiscal year 2016, the company saw its Mac personal computer business plunge. Unit shipments dropped 10%, with revenue dropping similarly. Apple seemed to blame this decline on the state of the overall personal computer market, claiming that the Mac unit shipment decline was at a rate ""similar to the overall [personal computer] market.""

Apple also added that the ""effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar"" hurt its Mac revenue.

During fiscal year 2017, Apple saw a marked turnaround in its Mac business. Revenue was up 13% year over year on unit shipment growth of 4%.

Apple CFO Luca Maestri said during the company's most recent earnings call that the company's Mac products ""gained significant market share"" as overall industry wide PC shipments dropped 1%, per estimates published by IDC.

""This performance was fueled primarily by great demand for MacBook Pro,"" Maestri said.

On top of a return to both Mac unit and revenue growth during the year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that during fiscal year 2017 , Apple's Mac revenue hit a record. That's not bad, considering the overall personal computer market has been steadily declining for roughly half a decade.

It's also worth noting that because Mac revenue growth dramatically outpaced Mac unit shipment growth, Mac average selling prices rose. Apple credits the average selling price increase to selling ""a different mix of Macs with higher average selling prices."" It's clear from these results that Apple's Mac business is back.

One thing that probably hurt Apple's Mac business during fiscal year 2016 was that the company didn't offer compelling refreshes of its MacBook Pro lineup during that year. Indeed, Apple's MacBook Pro with Touch Bar lineup didn't launch until November 2016, which meant the devices didn't start selling until the beginning of Apple's fiscal year 2017.

Apple seems to have learned its lesson, though. Even after launching the new MacBook Pro computers in late 2016, Apple refreshed the lineup again in June of this year, ahead of the back-to-school shopping season. These updated Macs were mainly specification bumps (so no big paradigm shifts this time around), but it's generally easier to market freshly updated computers to customers than nearly year-old ones.

If Apple continues to routinely update its MacBook Pro computers, the company's Mac business has a solid opportunity to continue to outperform the broader personal computer market.

Although I'm optimistic about the future of Apple's Mac business, I think Apple will have a tough time in fiscal year 2018 beating the revenue growth rate it saw this year. As noted above, Apple's Mac performance in fiscal year 2017 benefited from a refreshed set of MacBook Pro products after a year of stagnation.

This year, Apple will need to try to deliver both unit shipment and revenue growth off a much stronger baseline. I suspect that Apple will be able to grow unit shipments again by 1% to 3%. However, I think that average selling price growth will moderate considerably year over year, which could mean Mac revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digit percentages rather than the 13% Apple saw this year.

That's not a bad thing for Apple; growth atop record revenue is still quite impressive, especially given that the PC market still isn't the hottest tech market around. But, it's important for investors to keep their expectations in check to avoid being unduly disappointed."
11/7/2017,"On Sunday, Samsung dropped a new commercial on YouTube, encouraging Apple users to switch loyalties and ""upgrade to Galaxy."" The crux of its argument is that in recent years, Apple has lagged behind, debuting ""innovations"" on the iPhone that Samsung already featured on Galaxy models that were released first.

But I'm here to tell you why Samsung's ad is an epic fail.

Before moving on, here's full disclosure: I'm an Apple user. I'm writing this article on an iMac.Â I also own a MacBook, an iPhone, and an iPad. I own a few Samsung products, and my last phone (before purchasing an iPhone) was a Samsung. I realize the choice between Apple, Samsung, and other brands belongs to the consumer, and often is a matter of what appeals to the individual.

That being said,Â I believe this ad will do more harmÂ than good to Samsung, and here's why:

This is supposed to be a commercial for Samsung. You know what's funny about that?

Both the first and last images you see are Apple iPhones.

The commercial begins with Erik, the main character, walking past a long line of Apple enthusiasts standing in front of a sign featuring the very first iPhone, with the following tagline:

That image, followed by a scene in which Erik excitedly calls a loved one after buying his own iPhone, only reinforces the nostalgia of the debut of a device that literally changed the world.

Then there's the final image of the commercial, where Erik passes by a similar (yet noticeably shorter) line where people are queuing up to buy the iPhone X, Apple's new flagship product.

The problem isÂ these images are self-defeating. They draw attention to Samsung's chief rival and give Apple free publicity for its new phone (which many reviewers are calling the new gold standard for a smartphone).

I'll be the first to admit that Apple seems to have lost its edge as a true innovator.

But Apple's strong suit, at least the past few years, hasn't been debuting new tech. Instead, it's built a reputation based on:

The iPhone X is a perfect example. Reviewers admit that while Samsung was the first to useÂ OLED screens (which are purportedly superior to the LCD screens used in most smartphones for years), Apple has now optimized and improved the OLED. The technology used in Face ID has been around in laptops for a while now, but not in mobile devices (at least, not at this scale). And that missing headphone jack? Sure, it may still be a pain for some, but realistically speaking, thisÂ was an inevitable change that Apple simply pushed forward.

When Samsung demonstrates they had some features first, they only draw attention to the fact that Apple has improved on a number of themÂ and popularized other changes that will surely be copied in the near future.

When ErikÂ passes by those Apple disciples lined up outside, including one fanboy who has a haircut modeled after the infamous ""notch"" of the iPhone X, Samsung pokes fun at what many have referred to as the cult of Apple--those consumers who must have the absolute newest Apple products, right away, no matter the cost.

But here's the important thing Samsung is missing:

Most of us Apple users don't belong to that cult.

Consider me, for example. I've never stood in a long line to buy an Apple product. (Why do that when you can order online?) I still use an iPhone 5S as my main phone. My iPad is even older.

Do you know why consumers like me prefer Apple?

Sure, I like the style and features. I'm also a big fan of iOS and Mac OS, the operating system.

But there's another reason that's much more important: I prefer Apple because its products provide excellent return on investment.

That iPhone 5sÂ I'm using? It's four years old, but it still works great. So does my (even older) iPad. And I was completely happy with my Windows laptop (believe it or not, I'm a big Windows 10 fan) until the hardware broke, less than two years after I spent a thousand bucks on it. (That's when I bought my Macbook Pro, which is by far the best laptop I've ever owned.)

Samsung, you make great products. There's enough room in this world for both you and Apple.

But if it's really important that you lure customers away from your biggest competitor, focus on your strengths, and on making the very best version of your products possible.

Because ads like this may make me laugh, but they won't convince me to buy your phones."
2017-10-20T09:14:00-04:00,"One of the most important parts of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones is the company's custom-designed A-series processors that power them. Each year, Apple integrates new capabilities and improves the functionality of existing technologies in its chips.

These improvements directly touch virtually every part of the iPhone experience, ranging from the quality of the photos and videos that each new iPhone can take to the speed and quality of the games that iPhone users can enjoy on their devices.

Underpinning those improvements has been and continues to be improvements in chip manufacturing technology. Those improvements help to improve performance and power efficiency while at the same time allowing chip designers to keep chip sizes and chip costs in check.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC for short, has been a critical chip manufacturing partner to Apple over the last four years, having been the exclusive manufacturer of three of the last four iPhone processors and one of only two manufacturers of the A9 chip that powered the iPhone 6s.

On TSMC's website , the company says that it plans to start risk production of its 5-nanometer technology (which I'll refer to by the designation ""N5"" henceforth) in the second quarter of 2019.

Let's look at what this means for Apple.

Risk production, a TSMC spokesperson tells me, ""means that the technology has successfully reached a certain stage of reliability"" and that TSMC can begin to take in customer chip designs and ""begin small quantity production.""

There's usually a lag time of about a year between when a technology goes into risk production and when chips based on that technology can start being built for sale.

For example, TSMC claimed risk production start of its N10 technology, which is used to build Apple's A10X and A11 Bionic chips found in this year's iPad Pro and iPhone devices, respectively, in the first quarter of 2016; first N10-based chips showed up in the market about a year later.

So, if TSMC plans to go into risk production on N5 in the second quarter of 2019, then this means that it should be ready for volume production about a year after that in the second quarter of 2020.

If TSMC doesn't suffer any significant bumps during N5 technology development, then the technology should be ready to crank out Apple's A14 processors in support of the 2020 iPhone launch.

TSMC's N5 technology should be a little more than three times as dense as the N10 technology that's being used to manufacture Apple's A10X and A11 Bionic processors today. This means that Apple will have a lot of room to increase the number of transistors in its A14 chip compared to the A11 Bionic chip available today.

For some context, Apple says that the A11 Bionic has 4.3 billion transistors (chips are made up of transistors). In the same physical area that the A11 Bionic occupies, an N5-based chip could house nearly 14 billion transistors.

That's just an insane number of transistors.

Although it might seem insane to imagine that kind of transistor count in a mobile processor, it's not too hard to imagine how Apple will spend that transistor budget. Apple is likely to substantially increase the CPU, GPU, imaging, and artificial intelligence capabilities of its chips in the coming years all while adding dedicated technologies to handle tasks that those of us outside of Apple have yet to dream up.

If you thought this year's A11 Bionic chip was impressive, then let me tell you: The A11 Bionic is going to look downright primitive compared to what we'll likely see in an Apple iPhone in just three years time."
2017-11-02T09:00:00-04:00,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the close tonight. I happen to be expecting a miss in the September quarter relative to Apple's own guidance, which were incredibly bullish to begin with. When Apple provided its forecast back in August, it had the potential to be an all-time record for September quarter revenues. Initially, the bullish outlook suggested that the iPhone X may ship on time, particularly if you look at a detailed timeline of how 3D sensing suppliers are struggling to ramp up production.

When Apple officially confirmed that the iPhone X's launch would be delayed until November, that news called into question whether Apple could hit its guidance primarily on the backs of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Early indications point to soft iPhone 8 sales, as consumers hold out for the iPhone X. For context, here's how Apple has historically fared compared with its guidance.

Meanwhile, there is a constant barrage of supply-chain reports detailing production challenges, but shipping times on Apple's own site don't look that bad compared with prior years. Neither third-party media reports nor vague indications of shipping timelines are particularly reliable indicators to what's really happening with iPhone X production. The most meaningful indication that investors will get regarding iPhone X supply will come in the form of guidance.

In no uncertain terms, Apple's performance in the December quarter will absolutely hinge on iPhone X supply. Apple has saidÂ  iPhone X demand is ""off the charts,"" based on robust pre-order activity. The Mac maker is currently estimating that new orders will ship in five to six weeks, which already puts delivery into mid-December. There should be little question on the demand side of the equation.

The iPhone X production situation is evolving rapidly as component suppliers and contract manufacturers continue to improve production rates, and Apple leans more toward the conservative side with its financial forecasts, but in a matter of hours investors will get the clearest and most quantified indication yet as to how Apple itself thinks it will fare in the December quarter.

Last year, Apple posted revenue of $78.4 billion after selling a record 78.3 million iPhones. There's certainly enough demand for the iPhone X for Apple to overtake those record results, if only the company can produce enough unit volumes to meet that demand. Apple's guidance typically includes revenue, operating expenses, and expected tax rate, among other metrics that can be used to deduce net income, but revenue guidance will be the most important aspect of the forecast by far.

If the sales outlook looks soft, investors will know that it's because Apple's current assessment of the production ramp-up is weak. In contrast, if Apple's forecast includes the possibility of a new record in sales at the high end, investors can be cautiously optimistic that iPhone X production isn't as bad as the media has portrayed. Of course, management will provide some qualitative color regarding the iPhone X ramp, but investors should arguably focus more on the quantitative forecast.

We'll know in just a few hours how Apple thinks the December quarter will play out."
2017-10-30T17:54:26Z,"Blasphemy! You say. No one questions the mighty Apple Inc.âs (AAPL) financial dynasty. The stock has grown on a split adjusted basis from under $2.00 in the year 2002 to its present level of $166 per share on October 30, 2017. And as the price chart shows, over the past year the shares have increased steadily from $100 to the present trading range. Any dips in the share price move up have been good buying opportunities.

Why should anyone worry given the companyâs stellar brand position and cash on hand?

Count me as an investor that lives by the adage, âBulls make money, Bears make money, and Pigs get slaughtered.â And the persistent move higher and higher in the Apple share price on lower and lower share volume, flat net income growth, and a tired product line, creates plenty of reasons for shareholders to start to question the valuation.

But wait, the mighty Apple balance sheet is a fortress of cash, and continues to grow every quarter.

At $50 per share in cash, Apple does indeed have formidable staying power, and therefore, is unlikely to suffer any liquidity based concerns in the near future. But the question that begs to be asked at this juncture is whether the company is actually going to grow its earnings base in the future, or simple harvest its iPhone dominant market position?

Where I come down on the important question of whether Apple can actually grow substantially in the future, at least enough to justify its present stock valuation, is a definite no.

First, you need look no further than the past 4 years of earnings to see that the company is muddling through time without any clear new dominant product entering its portfolio to allow it to expand earnings. The iPhoneâs big earnings growth hit took place from 2010 through 2012. Since that time, the company has been in an earnings growth rut.

To energize growth, Apple is now trying to make ever more sensational new iPhone launch announcements. But the latest product launch announcement in my assessment is shear product line confusion. The company launches the iPhone 8, and then creates an immediate wait by introducing the iPhone X. Not to mention that putting an X in a product name is usually the âkiss of deathâ, Apple without question is struggling to find the next big hit after the phenomenal run Steve Jobs had with the iPod and then the iPhone. Having been in the network technology business for many years, I understand that tech product visionaries always work many years out on the curve in order to grab the next wave. Apple, however, is now seemingly stuck on the same wave, with no clear new product vision coming forward to drive the imagination of the âfeed me nowâ generation beyond the iPhone.

Enter the Apple CFO and Tim Cook to save the companyâs stock from being hammered into oblivion. And the financial engineering that has been used by many tech companies over the last 8 years (OTCPK:MFST) (ORCL) (CSCO) (IBM) is also being used at Apple to pump up a slow growth financial situation. The stock buyback program at Apple, Inc. is a financial âbeauty.â Back in 2012 the company had 6.6B fully diluted share on the books. As of July 2017, the share number had dwindled to 5.2B.

To finance the buy-backs the company has entered the debt market to raise capital, not wishing to pluck the feathers from its overseas cash stash to buy-back the shares thereby incurring a large tax bill. The huge imbalance created by this financial engineering exercise is noteworthy. First, in 2012 Apple Inc, like many tech companies, did virtually no borrowing, and for very good reason. Most tech executives know that the half life of their best products are 7 years or shorter. Borrow against the future when the product line needs to turn over that quickly, and you are destined to be owned by the debt-holders sooner or later.

In Appleâs case, however, they have taken the share buy-back solution one step further. Appleâs CFO is borrowing against its mega-cash balance held overseas, and running a levered bond fund inside the corporation to make this numbers work for Wall Street. Currently the company sits on $261B in cash and equivalent investments, and has borrowed long-term about $90B to fund the buy-backs. Assuming the tech business in Apple in normal market circumstances would maintain very low leverage, this makes the bond investment portfolio levered at about 35%. Margin regulations on funds and investors in the market are limited to 40%. In my opinion, the Apple CFO definitely is running a risky financial operation, and one that could bite unknowing shareholders very hard in the near future, particularly if interest rates continue to increase.

Leverage is a double edge sword, and in the case where a CFO starts to use it to buy-back company shares at an increasing pace, shareholders need to pay close attention to the risks involved. In the current Apple situation, the biggest loser with the increasingly leveraged balance sheet is, and probably has been for several years now, new product investment. I am not talking about revitalizing the iPhone. The company has already proven there are multiple competing contenders to be the next star, neither of which is likely to solve the earnings growth required to justify the current nosebleed stock price level. This circumstance, in my assessment, is a symptom of a growing problem.

The simple fact that Apple is buying back shares at such a rapid pace to prop up the share price is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the risk being taken on. Apple is generating sufficiently large levels of cash flow to support an on-going buyback program. However, the company has chosen instead to borrow money to fund the buy-back, some long-term, but much of it short-term. Meanwhile they have chosen to keep a large bond fund on their balance sheet, sitting mostly overseas to dodge US taxes. This bond fund, by the way, has $150B (about 60%) invest in the bonds of other corporations â not risk-free US Treasuries.

What happens as the interest rate mess created by the Federal Reserve, and followed by the ECB and the BOJ starts to unravel and the market begins to demand a real interest rate as a return for risky investments? Apple loses in multiple ways. One, the bond portfolio takes a hit. A 10% hit on a $261B portfolio, which could happen if rates rose 100 basis points, would translate to a substantial $26B unrealized loss in the securities portfolio that would flow through as an equity reduction on the balance sheet. Likewise, the short-term debt that was being borrowed to lever up the business to buy-back the shares would need to be refinanced at higher rates. The interest expense line at Apple is currently running at $2.4B (annualized 3Q 2017 level). This value could easily double if rates rise 100 basis points or more.

And lastly there is the unknown chain reaction that these events will have on Board Room decisions as the balance sheet losses start to mount and the CFO wakes up to see the risk for Appleâs future his structured finance play in the financial markets, rather than focusing on Appleâs core business. The most likely reaction by the Board will be a âbelt-tighteningâ maneuver inside the company, which will end up hitting future product investment for some period of time. At that point, it will definitely be time to sell Apple shares and find better risk reward opportunities for your investment dollar.

The underlying challenge in maintaining a fortress tech company is that the castle is always built out of sand. Tech product half lives are usually 7 years or less. If Apple does not soon produce a revolutionary product, the tech fortune it has amassed will crumble and the sand castle will be washed away.

With so much emphasis today on the Apple stock buyback program and whether they can successfully re-vitalize an aging iPhone product line as the basis for the stock valuation, odds are high that Apple will be the bellweather indicator of the next big stock market failure in the future. Plenty of other tech companies are using the same buyback playbook. (OTCPK:MFST) (CSCO) (ORCL) (IBM) Buyers beware when the tech market finally reaches a top as interest rates continue to climb. The crashing sound you will hear will likely be similar to the pull-back experienced in year 2000, but this time for a very different reason.

This has been great for companies that make and sell memory, but it's made life tougher for companies that design memory into their products. They've had to increase prices of their products, accept lower profit margins, or some combination of the two.

On Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) most recent earnings call, company CFO Luca Maestri quantified the impact that increased memory prices is going to have on the company's gross profit margins in the current quarter.

Let's take a closer look at Maestri's comments.

Apple says that for its current quarter -- that's the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 -- the memory pricing environment is leading to a 110-basis-point reduction in the company's overall gross profit margin percentage.

For some context, Apple says that it expects a gross profit margin percentage of between 38% and 38.5% for the current quarter. If memory prices didn't budge from where they were last year, then Apple would be guiding to a gross profit margin percentage of between 39.1% and 39.6%.

Although it might seem like a 110-basis-point gross margin percentage decline isn't a big deal, it starts to look a lot bigger when translated into dollars.

Apple says that it expects revenue of between $84 billion and $87 billion in the current quarter, so thanks to higher memory prices, the company is losing out on between $924 million and $957 million in gross profit. That additional gross profit would translate entirely into operating income, because there'd be no additional operating expenses associated with it.

This means that Apple is expecting to lose out on nearly a billion dollars in profit this quarter thanks to elevated memory prices.

Although the financial impact of higher memory prices is evident, there's a bigger-picture impact, too: Apple's ability to pack more memory into its products.

As far as memory used for storage goes, this isn't that big of a problem. Apple has always offered variants of its iPhones with different amounts of storage, and it usually charges extra for products with additional storage, so Apple is generally able to profit handsomely from devices with additional memory content.

The same isn't true for DRAM, which is the type of memory that's used as primary system memory. Apple doesn't generally disclose the amount of DRAM that it includes in its devices, but since the amount of memory in a device directly impacts performance, Apple can't really use DRAM content as a selling point.

Instead, Apple seems to endow its iOS devices with the amount of DRAM required deliver the desired user experience -- no more, no less.

High DRAM prices will make it difficult for Apple to increase the amount of DRAM that it includes in its iPhones and iPads. Now, I don't think Apple would sacrifice the user experience that it delivers just to avoid paying more for DRAM content, but the company's margins could suffer even more once it needs to increase the amount of DRAM in its devices.

Apple could, of course, raise device prices to try to compensate for the increased DRAM content, but such increases could negatively impact demand."
2017-11-10T09:48:29-05:00,"Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) certainly have been on a tear since their latest earnings report. Earnings, revenues and guidance all beat estimates, but the stock reaction has now far outpaced any earnings-related justification. While I am not overly bearish on Apple going forward, I feel AAPL stock has come too far, too fast and is due for a consolidation.

Apple is now trading at the richest P/E ratio over the past five years, with a multiple exceeding 19. The previous time AAPL stock even approached such a rich valuation was in November 2014, which coincidentally signaled a major top in the stock price.



 Click to Enlarge A market cap now exceeding $900 billion will also make it more difficult for Apple to grow simply by the law of large numbers, thus making it tougher to justify a higher P/E multiple.

From a technical perspective, Apple stock price is definitely getting overbought. The 9-day RSI is over 80, which previously marked a significant intermediate-term top in AAPL. Apple is also up over 12% since making a low on Oct. 25 and had risen nine out of the past 10 days. Shares are trading at a huge premium to the 20-day moving average of $164.20, yet another sign of overexuberance.

The mere fact that AAPL stock finally had a down day after the latest run may likely lead to some profit taking by momentum players.



 Click to Enlarge So to position for a coming period of consolidation in AAPL stock, a short-term out-of-the-money call spread makes intuitive sense.

Maximum gain is $50 per spread with maximum risk of $200 per spread. Return on risk is 25%. The short $177.50 strike price is well above the Apple all-time high of $176.24.

2017-11-08T16:11:46Z,"By Parke Shall with Scott Tzu

There have been several significant events that have occurred since the last time we wrote about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), each one of which we believe helps confirm our bearish thesis on the company. We wanted to take a moment and write about these developments today to supplement our September article on why we think Apple is likely due for a pullback in the short-term.

First, we want to remind our readers that over the course of the long term, like over the next 5 years to couple of decades, we are bullish on Apple. The company is fundamentally sound and will likely continue to grow consistently. However, we began to construct a thesis as to why we believe the stock is starting to border on overvalued back in September. Since then, the company has put out earnings that beat Wall Street estimates and subsequently its stock price continued to rise.

Today we wanted to take a minute to briefly update our short term bearish case on the company and introduce a few new reasons that confirm our belief that the company is overvalued at current levels. Hereâs what has happened since our last article,

- Apple reported earnings

- Broadcom reportedly made a $103 billion offer for QUALCOMM

- We finally got to use an iPhone X alongside an iPhone 8 and are not impressed

- The overall market continues to move higher and Apple stock has appreciated more than 10% more

There was plenty to be excited about on the earnings front. After all, Apple is pretty much expected now to beat earnings each quarter. Despite these expectations that we believe the market already carries, Apple did post a impressive corner. It beat both revenue and EPS estimates, itâs saw a return to revenue growth in China, product sales beat all expectations across the board for iPhone, iPad and Mac and the company is now sitting on $269 billion in cash. All told, it seemed difficult for anybody in the financial media to point out anything other than these âblowoutâ numbers when reporting about the company's quarter. With that said, there are a couple items that we are keeping a cautious eye on heading into the holiday quarter.



1. First, Apple has come out and guided for the holiday to be its ""biggest quarter ever"". At face value, this appears like its great news, but we must also be cognizant of the fact that Apple is now sitting very high expectations for the upcoming quarter. The higher the expectations are set, the more positive sentiment is going to be priced into the company prior to the next earnings report. Apple will have to deliver in a significantly profound way in order to continue rallying as strongly as it has been after its holiday quarter.



2. Second, there still seems to be some unsurety as to iPhone X supply, as CEO Tim Cook fielded questions on the conference call with some relatively vague answers regarding when supply would be able to meet demand for iPhone X. With regard to supply and demand, Cook stated,

Additionally, Cook didnât get into any type of detailed iPhone product mix answers, but rather said that âthe 8 Plus had the fastest start of any plus model"". The day after the earnings report, the iPhone X officially hit stores.

The recently released proposed takeover by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to try and acquire QUALCOMM (QCOM) just days ago, we think, helps reiterate our case that the NASDAQ may be nearing a top. We have noted on more than one occasion that we believe the stock market is dangerously overpriced and that eventually the overall broader market will pull back, bringing Apple stock with it.

Apple is very much a beta stock that moves with the overall market, as we wrote about in our September article addressing some of our concerns as to why we think Apple may pull back. In that article, we stated that we thought the market was significantly over valued and that any further moves higher should be used by investors to scale back long positions. In the two months succeeding that article, both the market and Apple stock have moved higher, defying our thesis and also making the stock that much more expensive.

This was all topped off by what is being called the largest possible technology takeover offer in history with Broadcom making an unsolicited $103 billion offer for QUALCOMM. The fact that the largest possible merger in technology could be taking place helps to support our case that all major industries, but especially technology, could be nearing a top. These are not the types of deals that you see when an industry is in recession or cooling off, these are the types of deals you see during stages of euphoria.

The 8 Overshadows the X: So What's Next in the Innovation Pipeline?



In addition to the technology sector possibly nearing a top, we want to reiterate our previously noted concerns about Appleâs lack of future innovation. We wrote in our September article that we were concerned about Apple's innovation runway going forward and that the company may have completely blown out all of its good news and future hype with the release of the iPhone X. While the lack of an innovation runway going forward was our initial concern, that concern has now mutated into concern about how well the iPhone X is going to be received in and of itself.

We had the opportunity to use an iPhone X for the first time just this past weekend and we canât say that we are especially impressed. Keeping in mind that this comes from a group of individuals who have been long time bulls on Apple and fans of the companyâs products, the iPhone X doesnât seem to bring much new to the table. We compared it to the iPhone 8 Plus, which we actually found to be the nicer phone. The smaller iPhone X and the corresponding rectangular ribbon at the top of the phone just doesnât seem like it fits the innovation and quality standards that Apple has been known for. In addition, because of the wireless charging capabilities, Apple has sacrificed weight. Both phones are much heavier and the new casing causes them to slide off of almost any fabric surface very easily.

The design is already being mocked by Samsung, in its latest commercial. We find this telling, as design is what Apple is supposed to be known for.

For a company that is so focused on aesthetics and design, we didnât find that the larger screen stood out much at all. As a matter fact, it drew attention to the rectangular black bar at the top of the screen that looks misplaced and unbecoming of Apple design standards.

While the phone functioned perfectly and we didnât have any issues with Face ID, the overall aesthetic and design when compared to the iPhone 8, we believe, makes the iPhone X an inferior phone for the price. Given that much of the company's success heading into the holidays is going to be dependent on this phone being a blockbuster and Apple being able to meet demand (which they sounded slightly unsure of on the conference call), weâre not sure that we can throw all of our confidence behind the companyâs latest âmarquee"" offering. Put simply, over the last decade or so, we have expected more from Apple when it comes to a flagship product like it is trying to sell us, for its exorbitant price, in the iPhone X. While the functionality weâre sure is fine, we donât think the design is going to bring anything new to the table that is going to make this phone stand out, nor do we believe that the X is going to significantly outperform the 8 when it comes to sales. If you recall, sales of the iPhone 8 have been reported to be hit or miss from the get go, and many analysts have tried to direct investors' attention to upcoming sales of the iPhone X. Whether or not the product sells like a blockbuster is one thing, but we donât feel from using it that the product is a ""must have"" above the iPhone 8 when we compare the two. Does Apple have any big shots left to fire in its phone innovation pipeline?

Apple Stock Will Probably Pull Back, Offering a Better Spot for Entry



And so where does this put us? It puts us in a position where the overall markets have moved even higher since our article in September. Apple stock has moved up more than 10% since we wrote that article, which you could argue makes us incorrect about our September assertions, but also that you could argue has made the stock that much more expensive.

The company had a blowout earnings report and has set the bar very high for holiday sales this year. Much of the holiday momentum is going to be expected to come from the iPhone X, which is a product that we just donât feel has enough uniqueness and style to differentiate it from the iPhone 8, let alone to make it a $1000+ purchase at a repetitive clip over the holiday season. Apple's forward PE remains well above its historical average, now trading at about 16X forward guidance when it has traditionally traded at about 12X or 13X.

In addition, we feel that the overall macroeconomic environment is setting up for bubbles in things like consumer credit and corporate debt to catalyze a eventual pull back in equity markets.

Given all of these factors, we believe the market will present potential Apple investors with a better entry spot than $174 over the coming months and possibly into Q1 2018.

2017-10-31T15:15:00-04:00,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is now contemplating ditching Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) modems altogether for the 2018 iPhone lineup, according to a pair of reports from Reuters and The Wall Street Journal. That doesn't come as much of a surprise considering how contentious the escalating legal battle between the two companies has become. At issue is certain software that Apple uses to test components, which Qualcomm has reportedly stopped providing to Apple.

That would suggest an aggressive shift toward Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) models, and Apple might even tap less prominent suppliers like MediaTek for its modem needs. Nothing has been finalized at this early stage, but it appears that Apple is giving the notion some serious consideration. Qualcomm shares are down 7% as of this writing.

Going back to the original complaint from January 2017, it's clear that Apple has wanted to switch modem suppliers for years. At a minimum, it has always wanted to add additional suppliers, which would reduce supply risk while providing negotiating leverage in securing more favorable volume pricing, which in turn would directly lead to cost savings. Here's what Apple wrote in January (emphasis added):

The company was unable to switch from Qualcomm due to an exclusive supply agreement that expired in 2016.

Qualcomm's top line has relied heavily on Apple and Samsung as its biggest customers for years, with the two smartphone juggernauts comprising as much as 49% of sales in fiscal year 2014. This figure, which includes licensing revenue as well as chip sales, fell to 45% in fiscal year 2015 and 40% in fiscal year 2016.

In other words, Qualcomm still has quite a bit of exposure to its souring relationship with Apple, and it would take a pretty meaningful hit if Apple made the call to cut Qualcomm modems out.

On a technical level, Apple could conceivably switch to Intel for all of its modem needs in 2018. The Intel modem that powers 2017 iPhones does not support CDMA networks like Verizon and Sprint in the U.S. (those iPhone models still use Qualcomm basebands). Intel's forthcoming XMM 7560 will support CDMA, and while it may still lag Qualcomm's modem performance in certain areas, it should be perfectly sufficient for mainstream consumers.

Intel continues to deepen its relationship with Apple, and Apple's opposition to Qualcomm's business practices is a ""principled stand."" Beyond gross margin considerations, Apple has plenty of other reasons to make the switch."

2017-10-19T09:06:00-04:00,"Earlier this week, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) self-driving car prototype was again spotted on public roads in California. However, there were some notable changes this time around: Apple has significantly increased the number of sensors that are mounted on the roof. There are now no less than six lidar sensors mounted on top of a massive array that is affixed to the top of the vehicle, supplemented by numerous cameras and radar sensors. The sensor suite looks similar to prototypes that were spotted in August.

MacCallister Higgins, the co-founder of Voyage, spotted the prototype and shared the brief clip on social media. Voyage is a start-upÂ that is developing autonomous taxis, so Higgins knows a thing or two here.

Here's another recent shot shared by a different user on social media.

Compare that to the prototypes that were seen cruising around in April and May. For example, Bloomberg reporter Alex Webb saw one in late April.

The sheer size of the sensor array suggests that all of the computing hardware necessary to process the autonomous driving tasks is located within the array. That's a markedly different approach compared to other companies pursuing autonomous driving, which often put the computing hardware in the trunk where there's plenty of room. The inevitable question is why is Apple putting the compute stack inside the roof mounted array?

There are two possible explanations. The first being that by developing a self-contained unit, Apple can more easily swap out prototypes during testing, potentially in order to test the system on different types of vehicles.

The far more interesting and speculative idea that's now floatingÂ around is that Apple intends to develop a modular array that could be retrofitted onto vehicles as an aftermarket upgrade that enables autonomous driving, similar to what Comma.ai had initially hoped to do before regulators nixedÂ that idea (Comma.ai has since pivotedÂ to selling a tool that allows people to hack into their vehicles). The chances of Apple actually going this route for its final product are somewhere between slim and none.

On a technical level, it's unlikely that such a modular upgrade would even work. Autonomous driving systems require deep integration with a vehicle's core driving functions. The systems aren't exactly comparable, but as another data point Tesla's Autopilot system can't be retrofitted because the procedure would be so invasive that the costs (mostly labor) would exceed buying a new vehicle, according to Elon Musk.

It would also be incredibly uncharacteristic for Apple to market an autonomous driving system as an aftermarket upgrade for existing vehicles. Not only would the company be compromising on hardware/software integration, the aesthetics -- something Apple cares deeply about -- would be atrocious. Not even Chief Design Officer Jony Ive could design a massive roof array that looks good on such a diverse set of vehicles. Ive is on recordÂ calling many modern car designs ""shocking,"" so would he really want to mount one of his creations on top?

Apple CEO Tim Cook has finally publicly acknowledged that the company is ""focusing on autonomous systems,"" which is also likely contributing to rising R&D expenditures. No one really knows what route Apple will take to market, and most of the choices are un-Apple-like. Perhaps Apple doesn't even know yet, but that's not stopping the Mac maker from moving forward on development."
2017-11-06T15:24:40.000Z,"Just days after announcing it would move its offices from Singapore to the U.S., Broadcom LtdÂ (NASDAQ:AVGO) is launching its biggest acquisition effort, offering to buy Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) for $70 per share, about $103 billion. Itâs not a coincidence.

From its Singapore base, the company formerly known as Avago Technologies found its effort to buy Brocade Communications Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:BRCD) last year slowed by a U.S. reviewÂ covering the sale of key technology to foreign entities, known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.

Now, with an appearance in the Oval Office by Malaysian-born CEO Hock Tan, that may no longer be a problem. The same would be true of a Qualcomm deal.

Qualcomm had become a bargain, falling 7% in value during a year where every other Big Tech name was rising sharply, because of its long-standing dispute with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) over chip royalties.

Apple is demanding discounts on intellectual property royalties, which Qualcomm charges for its patents even if a company buys chips elsewhere. Under CEO Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm has gone to war.Â  Apple has responded in kind and the reputation of both sides has been bloodied.

Tan is likely to end the conflict, doubtless on better terms than Mollenkopf is currently offering. There is also the question of what now happens with Qualcommâs ongoing effort to buyÂ NXP Semiconductors Inc. (NASDAQ:NXPI), which has stalled as investors like Elliot Management seek a higher price.

Broadcom has said its offer stands whether the NXP deal is completed at the current price of $110 per NXP share, or not. In other words, take it or leave it.

Broadcom is already a major Apple supplier, and if Tan, a hero in his native Malaysia, can broker a peace deal he could slow Appleâs ongoing efforts to seek other suppliers for its modem chips, such as Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC).

Investors have yet to grab the premium in Qualcomm that Broadcom is offering as trading opened on Nov. 6, with Qualcomm opening at less than $65 per share, against a deal value of $70 per share.

One reason for that is that $10 per share of the price being offered represents Broadcom stock, and the deal would be partly funded by $30 billion in new debt, increasing Broadcomâs debt-to-assets ratio. Another reason is that the deal could still take 18 months to clear through global antitrust regulators.

As this was written, Qualcomm was still evaluating the dealÂ but it is expected to reject the current price. Some analysts believe Qualcomm could fetch $85 per share in a bidding war, but that would require a second bidder.

While the deal might end the Apple litigation, a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would put together two companies who fought one of the biggest legal wars of the past decade, during which Qualcommâs lawyers were charged with serious ethical violations.

There are a lot of moving parts in this story, but the picture of Trump hugging Tan is the one that endures. If completed, this would be the largest pure technology merger of all time, and while the companyâs headquarters may remain American, its head will be in the Far East.

The merger is going to take time to play out. Broadcom is already a major supplier to Apple, and Appleâs view on this deal may be the key to whether it takes place."
2017-11-04T14:00:00-04:00,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings last week, and it was a blockbuster release both in terms of the September quarter as well as guidance for the December quarter. However, there was one big question mark buried within the release: a one-time positive adjustment of $640 million that was booked in the services segment.

Total services revenue jumped 34% to hit a new quarterly record of $8.5 billion, and $640 million is nothing to sneeze at, representing 7.5% of services revenue in the quarter. Apple's explanation was incredibly vague, merely stating: ""Services revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a favorable one-time adjustment of $640 million due to a change in estimate based on the availability of additional supporting information.""

There was hope that Apple would provide additional detail in its 10-K, but the iPhone maker merely repeated the same language in its annual report. Beyond a passing mention or two, the adjustment was also not discussed in detail on the conference call. What's going on with this one-time boost?

The most feasible explanation is that this adjustment is related to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google, which reported a meaningful increaseÂ in traffic acquisition costs (TAC) last quarter.

The TAC to distribution partners is the line item to focus on, which jumped 54% last quarter, as this relates to what Google pays to ""browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.""

On Alphabet's earnings call, CFO Ruth Porat highlighted mobile as a driver of rising TAC expenses (emphasis added):

The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the sites' TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites' TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.

On top of that, Porat added that TAC is expected to increase as a percentage of revenue going forward. Barclays analyst Ross Sandler asked if the TAC agreements might change as mobile search matures, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the value in these deals:

Sandler: It's just a philosophical question on TAC. So as the mobile search market matures, particularly the Western markets, the question is, why does Google feel like it needs to pay any TAC to partners at all? Is the lesson that you learned from the Firefox desktop partner loss a couple of years ago was that you didn't lose any revenue and you stopped paying TAC on that agreement? Why wouldn't the same logic apply to mobile search if not now, at some point in the future? Pichai: Look, I mean, first of all, we have a lot of experience in this area. We've been doing distribution deals for our search for well over a decade, and I've personally been involved all the way from the toolbar and the Chrome days. So by now, first of all, we want to construct a win-win construct. So we always want a construct in which we do better and our partners do better. And so doing TAC well aligns us in that way. And historically, it's driven a lot of growth. And so it's a model we understand. We understand the key economics behind it. And so we are very thoughtful about how we drive it forward. So we are driving it forward in a way in which we know it's going to give strong both revenue and earnings growth. And so I think we are pretty comfortable with how we are approaching it, and so we'll continue to do that.

There's a big difference in mobile relative to desktop, particularly as it relates to Apple. Unlike macOS, which allows users to change default browsers, iOS forces Safari to be the default mobile browser and does not allow users to change this preference. (Users can change the default search engine on both desktop and mobile.) This tight control effectively puts a much more valuable premium on mobile Safari's default search engine -- and Apple knows it.

In contrast, the rising popularity of Google's Chrome browser over the past decade as it overtook Firefox directly undermined the need to occupy Firefox's default search spot (which was long Mozilla's primary revenue source); Yahoo! scored the default search spot in Firefox back in 2014. In other words, Chrome cannot displace Safari on iOS in the same way that it displaced Firefox on desktop.Â It's also worth pointing out that Apple just switched Siri search from Microsoft Bing to Google too, which sounds an awful lot like a change in ""partner agreements.""

This all comes just months after Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimated that Google could end up paying Apple approximately $3 billion this year in TAC, which gets booked into Apple's services business. This revenue is ""nearly all profit,"" since Apple incurs virtually no cost in sending traffic to the search giant, which helps boost Apple's overall gross margin. It could offset some other margin headwinds that Apple is currently facing, like the current memory pricing environment. Apple's gross margin last quarter came in at 37.9%, near the high end of guidance.

Investors don't have confirmation, but all signs point to that $640 million adjustment coming from Google."
2017-10-27T10:00:00-04:00,"About a year from now, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to launch its next-generation iPhones. Although we don't know that much about them, one thing is certain: They'll be powered by a new generation of custom-designed Apple A-series applications processors, and they'll almost certainly be built using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) 7-nanometer technology.

This new technology, TSMC says, promises to deliver significant performance, power consumption, and chip area benefitsÂ over the 10-nanometer technology that's being used to manufacture Apple's latest A11 Bionic chips, which power the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X smartphones.

On TSMC's most recent earnings call, company management provided an update on how the development of this technology is progressing.

Let's go over what the executives had to say.

TSMC co-CEO C.C. Wei said that the company transferred its 7-nanometer manufacturing technology out of research and development and into manufacturing early in the third quarter of this year. This doesn't mean that TSMC is ready to begin mass-producing chips using the technology, but it does mean that the company is in the final stages of the development of the technology.

""Right now, our efforts focus on defect reduction and fine-tuning device performance to prepare for mass production in the first half of 2018,"" Wei said.

This might not make sense at first, especially if you're unfamiliar with chip industry lingo, so allow me to break it down for you.

When a wafer of semiconductor chips is produced, the wafer will have a certain number of defects spread out across the wafer. One metric that's used to measure the health of a manufacturing technology is defect density -- the average number of defects per unit area.

If part of a chip happens to be on an area of the wafer that has a defect, then that chip isoften unsuitable for use.

A chip manufacturer like TSMC aims to reduce the defect density inherent to a manufacturing technology for two big reasons. First, chip manufacturing plants are typically filled with enough equipment to build a certain number of chips under certain assumptions about manufacturing yield rate, which is heavily influenced by defect density.

If a chip manufacturer can't get the defect density down to acceptable levels, then its ability to meet demand could be impaired.

It's not just about meeting demand, though. The lower the defect density of a wafer, the more chips can be produced on a wafer, thereby increasing the value of that finished wafer to customers. This can mean higher wafer selling prices and ultimately better profit margins for the chip manufacturer.

With each new generation of manufacturing technology, chipmakers aim to increase performance and decrease power consumption. This allows potential customers to build faster, more efficient products than they could using older-generation technologies, which helps motivate customers to use the latest (and most expensive) chip manufacturing technologies available.

Moreover, chip designers often make their technical decisions based on the expected performance of the technology that they're using. If the chip manufacturer misses the mark on performance (or too few of the chips produced can hit the desired performance levels), then this could negatively impact the capabilities and marketability of a chip product, and ultimately the businesses of the chip manufacturer's customers."
2017-10-24T01:57:14-05:00,"It's been 6 and a half years of patent infringement suits, damages rulings, and retrials across 10 different countriesÂ  for Apple ( AAPL ) and Samsung, as they both try to claim ownership of the smartphone/tablet design.

Yes, they're fighting over who came up with the idea first, and there is no clear winner even after all this time.

In April 2011, Apple filed a lawsuit in the U.S District Court of Northern California, claiming that their component supplier and direct competitor Samsung had copied the design for the original iPhone and iPad. The suit was based on the original design patents submitted by Apple in 2007, only days before the iPhone was first launched globally.

Everything from the design, user interface, functionality, and 'style' were called into question.Â As the years went on the list of infringed products expanded;Â Apple claimed that Samsung's Nexus, Epic, and Galaxy phones/tablets were all based off of Apple's patents. A week later, Samsung had counter-sued Apple in three different countries (Korea, Japan, and Germany) claiming the same patent infringement against Apple.Â The lawsuits expandedÂ to the UK and US only aÂ few months later, andÂ by 2012, injunctions were filed in Dutch, French, and Italian courtsÂ as each company tried to halt sales of the competitor's devices.

On the US side, 2012 saw the verdictÂ favor Apple, finding that Samsung had infringed on Apple's device design and trade patents. The jury awarded Apple $1BN in damages, a practicallyÂ unprecedented winÂ for any lawsuit.

The ruling didn't last long however, as the presiding Judge Lucy H. Koh ordered a retrial after deciding that the jury had ' miscalculated ' the amount awarded by a few hundred million.Â  Samsung during this time never denied infringement, but their attorney did clarify, ""That doesn't mean Apple gets to come in here and ask for a windfallâ¦for more that it is entitled."" Samsung appealed the verdict of this case on questions surroundingÂ the payoutÂ and possible jury misconduct; they had managed to reachÂ a decision in less than 3 days.

The verdict was taken into a damages-focused retrial in 2013, where Samsung tried to negotiate down the awarded amount for Apple. Samsung offered up a payout of $52MN, which surely came off as an insultÂ to Apple and the huge amountÂ it had received in the first trial. In November 2013, the jury awarded $290MN to Apple. Still however, the case was not over.

On December 6,Â 2016Â the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the decision of the lower courts with aÂ 8-0 vote. The reversal required the case to be brought back to retrialÂ as the Justices said the companies needed to accurately and legally define the ""article of manufacture"" or what exactly is being infringed on.

Based on this decision,Â District Judge Koh openedÂ a second retrial on Sunday for the awarded monetaryÂ verdictÂ based on SCOTUS' opinions. Apple has not made a comment regarding the new trial, but Samsung released the below statement yesterday:

""We welcome to [sic] District Court's decision for a new trial. This is a historic opportunity to determine how the U.S Supreme Court's guidance on design patent damages will be implemented in our case and future cases.""

That it is Samsung. As technology rapidly innovatesÂ and progresses forward, these cases will act as precedent for many other technology-focused patent lawsuits;Â if the trials ever manage to reach a conclusion.

2017-11-08T12:00:14.769Z,"Apple Inc., seeking a breakthrough product to succeed the iPhone, aims to have technology ready for an augmented-reality headset in 2019 and could ship a product as early as 2020.

Unlike the current generation of virtual reality headsets that use a smartphone as the engine and screen, Appleâs device will have its own display and run on a new chip and operating system, according to people familiar with the situation. The development timeline is very aggressive and could still change, said the people,Â who requested anonymity to speak freely about a private matter.

While virtual reality immerses the user in a digital world, augmented realityÂ overlays images and data on the real one. The applications for AR are endless, from a basketball fan getting stats while watching a game to a mechanic streaming instructions on how to fix a specific piece of equipment. Apple isnât the only company working on the technology. Google, which drew derision for $1,500 smart glasses a few years ago, is developing a business-oriented variant. Startup Meta has developed a headset with a focus on education and medical uses.

Apple Chief Executive OfficerÂ Tim Cook considers AR less isolating than VR and as potentially revolutionary as the smartphone. He has talked up the technology on Good Morning America and gives it as almost much attention during earnings calls as sales growth. âWeâre already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn,â he said in the most recent call. âPut simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever.â

The company began putting together a team to work on AR-related projectsÂ a couple of years ago, Bloomberg reported in March.Â Led by Mike Rockwell, who previously ran engineering at Dolby Labs, the group has now grown to several hundred engineers from across Apple, the people said. Scattered across office parks in both Cupertino and Sunnyvale, California, the team is working on several hardware and software projects under the umbrella code name of âT288.â

The teamâs first product was ARKit, tools that outside software developers use to create AR applications for the latest iPhones and iPads, leveraging their screens, cameras and processors to create virtual 3-D interfaces for online shopping, education and gaming. This was an interim step, giving Apple an opportunity to test the technology on an existing product.

The next step --Â creating a headset with a built-in display capable of streaming 3D video without draining the battery -- is much more complicated. Cook acknowledged as much in a recent interview with The Independent, when he said: âAnything you would see on the market any time soon would not be something any of us would be satisfied with.âÂ Referring to challenges creating displays, Chief Design Officer Jony Ive told a tech panel last month that âthere are certain ideas that we have and we are waiting for the technology to catch up with the idea.â

As with previous products, Apple isnât waiting around for someone else to create a chip capable of powering its AR headset. Itâs designing one in-house thatâs similar in concept to the âsystem-on-a-packageâ component in the Apple Watch. Such chips can squeeze more components -- graphics processors, AI chip, CPU -- into a smaller area than standard processors; they also consume less power.

The new operating system, internally dubbed ârOSâ for âreality operating system,â is based on iOS, the iPhoneâs operating system. Just as tvOS powers the Apple TV, macOS runs on Macs and watchOS runs on Apple Watches, ârOSâ will power Appleâs AR headset. Geoff Stahl, formerly a software manager for games and graphics at Apple, is one of the directors of the ârOSâ software group.

Apple hasnât finalized how users will control the headset and launch apps, but is investigating touch panels, voice-activation via Siri and head gestures. Engineers are prototyping a range of applications, from mapping and texting to more advanced features including virtual meeting rooms and 360-degree video playback. The company has discussed pairing the headset with its own version of the App Store, where users would be able to download content, just as they do with the iPhone, Watch, Apple TV and Mac.

Because Apple doesnât have a fully operational headset of its own, engineers have begun using HTC Vive headsets for testing purposes. Theyâre also working on a device similar to an Oculus Gear VR headset that uses an iPhoneâs screen, cameras and chipsets. Apple doesnât plan to sell the gadget but instead aims to use it internally to test AR apps next year.

For more on Apple, check out theÂ DecryptedÂ  podcast:

With the headset at least two years away, Apple wants to make it easier for developers to bring new AR features to the iPhone. To that end, the company plans to release a new version of ARKit software tools as soon as 2018. They could help developers create software that remembers accurately where a digital object was placed in a virtual space, using a technology called persistent tracking; you look away, and the object is still there. The tools will also make it easier to create AR games for multiple players."
2017-11-16T20:53:47+00:00,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are up more than 45.99% this year and recently decreased -1.32% or -$2.26 to settle at $169.08. Energous Corporation (NASDAQ:WATT), on the other hand, is down -49.26% year to date as of 11/14/2017. It currently trades at $8.55 and has returned 15.54% during the past week.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Energous Corporation (NASDAQ:WATT) are the two most active stocks in the Electronic Equipment industry based on todayâs trading volumes. The market is clearly enthusiastic about both these stocks, but which is the better investment? To answer this, we will compare the two companies based on the strength of their growth, profitability, risk, returns, valuation, analyst recommendations, and insider trends.

Companies that can consistently grow earnings at a high compound rate usually have the greatest potential to create value for shareholders in the long-run. Analysts expect AAPL to grow earnings at a 11.57% annual rate over the next 5 years.

Growth isnât very attractive to investors if companies are sacrificing profitability and shareholder returns to achieve that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which control for differences in capital structure between the two companies, to measure profitability and return. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has an EBITDA margin of 32.39%. This suggests that AAPL underlying business is more profitable AAPLâs ROI is 18.30% while WATT has a ROI of -160.20%. The interpretation is that AAPLâs business generates a higher return on investment than WATTâs.

The value of a stock is simply the present value of its future free cash flows. AAPLâs free cash flow (âFCFâ) per share for the trailing twelve months was +1.64. Comparatively, WATTâs free cash flow per share was -0.37. On a percent-of-sales basis, AAPLâs free cash flow was 3.67% while WATT converted -0.57% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, AAPL is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.

Liquidity and leverage ratios provide insight into the financial health of a company, and allow investors to determine the likelihood that the company will be able to continue operating as a going concern. AAPL has a current ratio of 1.30 compared to 5.50 for WATT. This means that WATT can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. AAPLâs debt-to-equity ratio is 0.86 versus a D/E of 0.00 for WATT. AAPL is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.

AAPL trades at a forward P/E of 14.03, a P/B of 6.50, and a P/S of 3.81, compared to a P/B of 9.72, and a P/S of 84.35 for WATT. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.

Just because a stock is cheaper doesnât mean thereâs more value to be had. In order to assess value we need to compare the current price to where itâs likely to trade in the future. AAPL is currently priced at a -9.26% to its one-year price target of 186.34. Comparatively, WATT is -54.03% relative to its price target of 18.60. This suggests that WATT is the better investment over the next year.

The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80 for AAPL and 1.80 for WATT, which implies that analysts are equally bullish on their outlook for the two stocks.

No discussion on value is complete without taking into account risk. Analysts use a stockâs beta, which measures the volatility of a stock compared to the overall market, to measure systematic risk. A stock with a beta above 1 is more volatile than the market. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies a below average level of risk. AAPL has a beta of 1.21 and WATTâs beta is 1.98. AAPLâs shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.

Comparing the number of shares sold short to the float is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment. AAPL has a short ratio of 1.19 compared to a short interest of 6.79 for WATT. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for AAPL.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) beats Energous Corporation (NASDAQ:WATT) on a total of 9 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. AAPL is growing fastly, is more profitable, generates a higher return on investment, has higher cash flow per share and has a higher cash conversion rate. In terms of valuation, AAPL is the cheaper of the two stocks on book value and sales basis, Finally, AAPL has better sentiment signals based on short interest."
2017-11-06T08:00:00Z,"Apple's (AAPL) fiscal 4Q17 was one of the company's most solid quarters in recent memory - the widest top- and bottom-line beats since the March 2015 period. However one chooses to look at the numbers, whether by product category or geography, Apple seems to have lavishly outperformed, at least compared to prior periods.

But I was particularly excited to see one of my old, long-forgotten catalysts show signs of having a pulse once again: Greater China. The region delivered YOY growth of +11.6% that had not been achieved since fiscal 1Q16 (see graph below). Granted, the improvement was over a dismal fiscal 4Q16 quarter that saw sales nosedive by -30% after two equally soft quarters. Still, the geographic segment is so relevant for total company revenues that returning to growth in the region might have been the most important positive development in the September quarter.

Let me explore a hypothetical scenario a bit to give the reader further perspective. Assume that Apple had delivered much less impressive growth (or lack thereof) in China that was consistent with last quarter's -9.5% rate. In that case, I estimate that the company would have likely missed consensus revenue estimates and possibly beat on EPS only due to below-the-op line items - see my calculations below, which make certain assumptions on margins that are not disclosed by the company.

Robust results in the region were credited to ""unit growth and market share gains for iPhone, iPad, and Mac"", according to CEO Tim Cook during the company's earnings call. Strength in services, also mentioned, did not surprise me. This segment had been performing more solidly throughout fiscal 2017, as hinted in Apple's recently filed 10-K. The more stable service revenues tend to be fueled more by Apple's installed base rather than new device sales. But double-digit increase in iPhones and +25% growth in iPads in China certainly caught me by surprise.

In the past, softness in the important Hong Kong market had been often blamed for the poor results in the region. I admit having been a bit skeptical of the resilience of mainland China during Apple's multi-quarter downcycle, wondering if Apple's product portfolio post-iPhone 6/6 Plus cycle had not been properly aligned with consumer preference in the country. But this quarter's nearly +12% improvement in the country happened despite further (but decelerating) contraction in Hong Kong, suggesting strength outside the archipelago.

Apple's success in fiscal 4Q17, particularly in mainland China, could be attributed to the company's wider pricing range. For a while now, bears and skeptics have been claiming that the Chinese market could not easily absorb Apple's higher-end, richly-priced devices amid tough competitive pressure at the lower end of the spectrum. Now that the Cupertino company has gone to market with lower ticketed items on both the iPhone and iPad sides, it is possible that Apple has finally reached an important portion of the Chinese market by casting a wider net.

If the hypothesis is proved accurate, strength in the country could very well gain momentum, possibly leading Greater China sales to much healthier fiscal 2015 levels by fiscal 2020, in my view.

I believe China will once again catch analysts' and investors' attention, after six quarters of dismal performance. Whether momentum will be carried forward remains to be seen. Hong Kong is an improving but still soft spot, and FX headwinds can always blow in the company's face. But I suspect that Apple is better equipped in terms of its product portfolio to address the needs of a very large, very diverse demographic group.

All accounted for, I continue to be very bullish on Apple for the next several quarters at least.

2017-11-08T15:27:03Z,"Each week since June 8th, we've been sharing our top 10 names with our Marketplace subscribers. Apple (AAPL) was one of our top 10 names on June 8th, and after its post-earnings pop, it's now doubled the performance of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) since, making it the sixth-best performing stock in our June 8th cohort. It's also helped drive our top names portfolio from June 8th higher. We elaborate below, but first we offer a few comments on Apple's business.

This is a point the Lex column of the Financial Times made over the weekend (paywalled here). After noting the $999 price of the iPhone X, Lex pointed out Apple's presence at lower price points:

The FT didn't mention it there, but Apple's price points extend lower if you're willing to buy older models, and lower still if you're interested in a display model. While we were waiting for the Genius Bar at our local Apple Store last Thursday, we overheard one associate answer another's question about the cost of a display model of an iPhone 7: $149.

This is another point the same Lex column emphasized, pointing out that the App store and Apple Music already account for 16% of Apple's revenues, advising:

On Twitter, Cheddar put Apple's services revenue in perspective, comparing it to the total revenues for Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX):

And Apple isn't resting on its laurels when it comes to services.

Starting last year, Apple has taken a more creative approach in its App Store. We noted last year that it had started offering developers search ads within the store. Another change was allowing for recurring in-app subscriptions for all apps, something that formerly was limited to apps for media outlets such as magazines. And now, as Genady Okrain shared on Twitter on Monday, app developers will be able to offer introductory pricing for their subscriptions, including making them free:

Anything that lowers the barriers to a customer trying a new app subscription is promising for Apple's future services revenues. It also sounds promising for app developers, and it's something we may take advantage for a future update of the Portfolio Armor iOS app.

As we mentioned above, Apple was one of our top 10 names which we presented to subscribers in this post on June 8th. Since then, it's doubled the performance of the market, as represented by SPY:

That makes it our sixth-best performing stock from our June 8 cohort, which also included Align Technology (ALGN), Nvidia (NVDA), Illumina (ILMN), Netflix (NFLX), and LuluLemon (LULU).

Taking into account our four picks that have done worse than Apple since then, MercadoLibre (MELI), Electronic Arts (EA), Straight Path Communications (STRP), and Priceline (PCLN), the average performance of our top 10 names since June 8th has been 14.85%.

This was our top names portfolio presented in the same post to subscribers on June 8th. The idea here was to maximize the expected return for someone with $1,000,000 to invest who was unwilling to risk a drawdown of more than 9% over the next six months. Based on those parameters, this is what Portfolio Armor presented us with.

And here's how that portfolio has performed since - note the most recent bump, which came after Apple's earnings release last Thursday:

That performance is, incidentally, net of hedging and trading costs.

We were going to write ""Cassandras"" instead of ""crash predictors"" there, but were reminded that the Cassandra from Greek mythology was accurate in her prophecies of doom. In recent years, crash predictors haven't been so accurate. To pick a random example, consider this article from September of 2015 which argued that ""valuations and momentum suggest this could be an awful time to invest."" Since that article was published, the market has climbed nearly 38%.

With that in mind, our closing thought for crash predictors is to stop trying to predict crashes and instead position yourselves so you can profit from the bull market while it continues but are prepared for a crash when it comes. Our top names portfolio above, which includes a hedged position in Apple, illustrates a way of doing that. Although its return so for of 8.65% lags the 14.85% performance of our unhedged top names, it's competitive with SPY's 6.19% return over the same time frame and comes with the assurance of knowing its drawdown risk is strictly limited to a 9% decline. Peace of mind, while participating in the upside."
2017-11-06T13:43:12.000Z,"Another week of earnings has helped the market close near its highs on Friday, and it looks to open higher Monday as traders and investors alike continue to shovel money into equities.

Last weekâs earnings results from Apple gave the technology sector another boost in the arm as the stock is trading more than 3% higher in early movement. While the results are positive, there may be a chance to grab the stock on a pullback if history has anything to say about it.

Todayâs three big stock charts takes a look at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) as a potential âbuy the dipâ candidates.

With shares trading at their highs and the buzz over the newest of the iPhones hitting a frenzy may prove to be the wrong day to jump on the Apple stock bandwagon. According to our historical tracking, the stock tends to drop an average of around 6% after announcements as traders sell into the strength of the rumor turning to news.

Shares of âThe Generalâ are battered after the last earnings report weeks ago. Now, the stock is pressing against significant support that should result in a short-term bounce for the stock, but is it a hold from here? According to the charts, the answer is relatively clear.

Teslaâs post-earnings dive cracked some serious technical trendlines and now have the shares trading at a pivotal price point (say that fast three times). For the short-term traders there is an opportunity to grab some quick profits but the longer-term investors may want to consider the possibilities of lower target prices.

As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The post 3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Apple Inc., General Electric Company and Tesla Inc appeared first on InvestorPlace."
2017-11-07T21:16:00-05:00,"Investors should have very little doubt that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is hard at work developing augmented reality (AR) glasses. Not only has Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported on some early details regarding the project, but CEO Tim Cook can't seem to stop talking about the technology's game-changing potential (although we have yet to actually hear Cook ""yell out and scream"" about AR).

The Nikkei Asian ReviewÂ is out with a fresh report regarding one of Apple's suppliers for metal casings, Catcher Technology. Catcher just reported earnings -- and dropped some possible hints regarding potential new AR products during its conference call.

Apple sources metal casings for iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks from Catcher, which is also listed as one of Apple's top 200 suppliers for 2017. The company specializesÂ in light metal casings for the consumer electronics industry.

""Based on what we have learned, [new AR products] need to look good and be light enough to wear ... that makes the casings for such device very complicated to manufacture and there are still a lot of challenges to overcome currently,"" Catcher Chairman Allen Horng said during the call, according to the Nikkei. Horng did not specify Apple by name at any point.

The report also cites Yuanta analyst Jeff Pu as predicting that Apple may launch its AR glasses as soon as 2019, which is a year earlier than when noted Apple analyst Gene Munster thinks they'll ship.

On Apple's earnings call last week, Cook again reiterated how excited he is for AR, even suggesting he'd happily go back to grade school:

The reason I'm so excited about AR is, I view that it amplifies human performance instead of isolat[ing] humans. And so, as you know, it's the mix of the virtual and the physical world. And so it should be a help for humanity, not an isolation kind of thing for humanity. As I go through different countries, as I've been traveling lately and looking at things, some things in the market, other things that are coming, the very cool thing is they're all over the place. I see things that the consumer's going to love because it's going to change shopping. I see things that consumers will love on the gaming side, on the entertainment side. I see business-related AR apps as well that are going to be great for productivity between small and large business. And I see apps that makes me want to go back to K-12 again and repeat my schooling because I think it changes the game in the classroom a lot. And so the real beauty here is that it's mainstream.

Meanwhile, Apple's research and development expenditures continue to grow ever greater, recently hitting a new high as a percentage of revenue. The Mac maker's ongoing exploration of autonomous driving systems surely takes up a fair chunk of that R&D budget, but it's safe to say that Apple is also investing heavily in AR, as it's clearly a priority for Cook."
2017-11-16T18:25:06+00:00,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock flux has recently been causing stir among the investment community. At the end of the day, itâs only a stockâs performance that matters. With this in mind, itâs worth taking a look at the chart to get a sense of where it might be headed in the future.

How has the stock performed recently?

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the last month has increased +5.83%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 257%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $169.08, AAPL sits below its 52-week high. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stockâs 20 and 200 day moving averages.

Of course, these surface-level price movements donât tell us much about the direction that AAPL may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AAPL is 57.90%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 77.49%, tells a different story, and suggests that AAPL currently trades in overbought territory.

What do the trading volumes reveal?

Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, itâs often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Apple Inc. (AAPL) average trading volume of 30,673,455 during the past month is 14.71% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times.

What do the analysts think?

AAPL is currently undervalued by -9.26% relative to the average 1-year price target of $186.34 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AAPL over the next year.

How risky is the stock?

In order to put AAPLâs recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stockâs price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a beta of 1.21, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stockâs price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AAPL therefore has a above average level of market risk.

Apple Inc.âs head of diversity and inclusion is leaving the technology company after a few months in the role.

Denise Young Smith will depart at the end of 2017 and will be succeeded by Christie Smith, a veteran of accounting firm Deloitte LLP, an Apple spokesman said. Young Smith was named to the diversity role in May. Before that, the 20-year Apple veteran oversaw human resources at the iPhone maker, which included diversity efforts.

Young Smith, who is black, apologized to her team in October after she was reported by TechCrunch and other news organizations to have told a conference that a group of âwhite blue-eyed blond menâ could also be considered diverse based on their different life experience and perspective.

Young Smith is joining the faculty of Cornell Universityâs New York technology campus. TechCrunch reported her departure from Apple earlier on Thursday."
