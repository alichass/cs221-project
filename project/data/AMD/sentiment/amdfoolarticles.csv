            ","Chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and perpetual runner-up Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have benefited greatly from the fact that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows, the overwhelmingly dominant PC operating system, can only run on x86 CPUs. The market for PC CPUs is a duopoly thanks to this limitation.
Microsoft attempted a version of Windows that ran on ARM processors, the standard for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, back in 2012 with Windows RT. It was an unmitigated failure. The problem: Windows RT could only run applications built specifically for the platform. Standard windows applications were incompatible, leaving Windows RT with a hobbled software ecosystem that led to its downfall.
Microsoft is trying again, and this time its plan makes a lot more sense. At Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon Tech Summit earlier this month, Microsoft unveiled the first PCs under its Always Connected PC initiative. These PCs are powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors, the same processors found in flagship Android devices. The core features include integrated LTE connectivity and a battery life in excess of 20 hours, as well as support for the full Windows 10 operating system. That means the entire catalog of Windows applications, minus a few exceptions, can be run on these ARM PCs.

Microsoft clearly learned from its mistakes. Instead of creating a new flavor of Windows, Windows 10 has been ported to run on the Snapdragon 835 chip. Standard windows applications that require an x86 processor will be emulated, meaning that the x86 instructions will be translated into ARM instructions.
Emulation will introduce a performance penalty, and we'll have to wait until devices are out in the wild to know exactly how severe that penalty is. Whether these ARM PCs will be powerful enough to effectively multitask, running multiple emulated applications simultaneously, remains to be seen.
The Always Connected PC initiative isn't limited to Qualcomm chips. AMD announced a collaboration with Qualcomm that will pair its Ryzen Mobile processors with Qualcomm's LTE modems, for example. But the most exciting part of this effort from Microsoft is the introduction of a third player in the PC CPU market.
Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad has matured into a viable alternative to a laptop for users with light computing needs. The Always Connected PC initiative seems like an effort on the part of Microsoft to win back that crowd. The iPad has also made inroads among business users, so it's not surprising that Microsoft emphasized the benefits for organizations when it unveiled these new devices.
I doubt that ARM chips will proliferate to other parts of the PC market anytime soon, given the downsides of emulation and the fact that these Snapdragon chips are designed for mobile devices. But a Qualcomm chip running Windows 10, and supporting x86 applications, is not a positive development for Intel or AMD. At least in a portion of the laptop market, the duopoly will be no more.
Microsoft and Qualcomm are the big winners, along with consumers who will now have more options. For Microsoft, the goal is to put Windows on as many devices as possible while preventing competing platforms like the iPad and Chromebooks from further encroaching on its turf. For Qualcomm, this opens up a whole new market for its chips.
These ARM PCs may not be available until early next year. But when they do launch, they have the potential to shake up the PC industry.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), one of the hottest chip stocks of 2016, slumped more than 10% this year as rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) struck back with new chips. On the surface, AMD's growth still looks solid -- analysts expect its revenue to rise 23% this year and for it to achieve non-GAAP profitability after two straight years of losses.
However, its outlook for 2018 looks murkier. Analysts expect its sales growth to slow to 12% for the year but for its non-GAAP earnings to nearly triple on tighter cost controls. Let's examine the four main areas for AMD's businesses investors should watch next year.
Image source: AMD.
AMD scored a brief victory earlier this year with its new Ryzen CPUs, which offered comparable performance as Intel's current-generation Kaby Lake CPUs at lower prices. AMD also launched the high-end Threadripper (two eight-core Ryzen CPUs linked by its Infinity Fabric), and challenged Intel's near-monopoly in data centers with its Epyc chips.
However, Intel subsequently struck back with new Coffee Lake chips in its final 14nm Skylake refresh, which widened the gap against Ryzen in desktop benchmarks. It also launched the premium Skylake-X to counter Threadripper, and unveiled next-gen Xeon Phi CPUs for data centers.
But AMD isn't down for the count. It will launch its Raven Ridge APUs -- which combine Ryzen CPUs with Vega GPUs -- for laptops by the end of the year. Reports also indicate that its new 12nm Ryzen 2 chips could arrive next February. Those chips might keep AMD safe until Intel launches its 10nm Cannonlake chips in late 2018.
AMD's situation in GPUs is similar. Its Radeon cards briefly gained a price advantage against NVIDIA's GeForce cards last year, but NVIDIA struck back in the low-end market with powerful budget cards like the GTX 1050.

AMD launched its next-gen Vega GPUs earlier this year, but they merely offered comparable performance to NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal GPUs at similar prices. This was an odd move for AMD, which usually targeted lower price points than NVIDIA. To make matters worse, NVIDIA then unveiled Volta, its 12nm successor to the 14nm-16nm Pascal.
Volta-based GPUs are currently only available for data center customers, but NVIDIA plans to launch the consumer versions next year. AMD plans to counter Volta with its next-generation 12nm Vega GPUs next year, but it could face a tough uphill battle.
Lastly, investors should also keep an eye on the unpredictable cryptocurrency mining market, which could lift demand for both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs next year.
In a strange twist, AMD recently partnered with Intel to integrate its Radeon graphics into Intel's upcoming chipset for laptops. This partnership is risky, since it could curb demand for AMD's own Raven Ridge APUs.
Intel also recently hired Raja Koduri, AMD's former Radeon chief, to lead its new Core and Visual Computing Group to create discrete GPUs. That's a troubling development for both AMD and NVIDIA, which hold a duopoly in the discrete GPU market.
Therefore, it doesn't seem wise for AMD to work closely with Intel, even if both companies want to throttle NVIDIA's growth. Investors should see where AMD's partnership with Intel leads next year and whether Intel's discrete GPUs will become a threat to its Radeon cards.
AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business became a pillar of growth over the past few years as it supplied semi-custom SoCs to leading gaming consoles like the Xbox One and PS4. But with both consoles now four years old, the EESC business needs fresh catalysts.
The recent updates to the Xbox One and PS4 might boost the unit's sales. Microsoft introduced the smaller Xbox One S and the more powerful Xbox One X, while Sony launched the comparable PS4 Slim and PS4 Pro.
Meanwhile, other new niche devices, like the Ataribox, also use AMD's custom SoCs. If these catalysts generate fresh growth for the EESC business, it could offset any softness in its core Computing and Graphics (CPU and GPU) business.
I think AMD could rebound next year if it plays its cards right. However, the stock could also keep slipping if the next-gen Ryzen and Vega chips don't live up to expectations.
AMD also isn't cheap at 28 times next year's earnings, which is much higher than Intel's forward P/E of 13. Therefore, I'll keep an eye on AMD, but I don't plan to buy any shares until it proves that it can withstand the competition from Intel and NVIDIA.

            ","When the calendar finally changes over to 2018, investors will likely look back and marvel at the annual gains of cryptocurrencies.
Just how good have cryptocurrencies been as a whole? Since the year began, the aggregate market cap of virtual currencies has increased from $17.7 billion to $293 billion as of Nov. 26. That's a better than 1,550% gain in less than 11 months. Of course, bitcoin has played a big role in this advance. The largest and most popular cryptocurrency in the world (out of more than 1,300 cryptocurrencies) has seen its market cap climb to $155 billion, up from around $3 billion just a few years ago.

However, bitcoin is arguably not the story of the year when it comes to virtual currencies. That title just might belong to Ethereum. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap vaulted to a new all-time high last weekend, touching $480 per Ether token, and placing its market cap at $46 billion. By comparison, Ethereum began the year at just $7.98 per token. That's a gain of more than 5,900% in less than 11 months. It's taken the broad-based S&P 500 six decades to deliver comparable returns.
What's driving such impressive gains in Ethereum, you wonder? It looks to be a mountain of excitement regarding blockchain technology. Blockchain is the digital and decentralized ledger that records transactions without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank, and it's what underlies most cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.
Blockchain technology has been shown to be incredibly cost-effective relative to current financial services industry software, but it's the security and settlement times of these open-source networks that really have investors pumped. Since it's an open-source network, changing logged data without someone else noticing would be almost impossible, meaning blockchain is incredibly secure. It also allows for the possibility of real-time settlements in the business world, which would open up new doors for cross-border transactions.
Investors are stoked about the 200 organizations, including some well-known companies, that are currently testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain in pilot or small-scale programs. For Ethereum, nabbing enterprise customers with its proprietary blockchain is the ultimate goal.

But investors in Ethereum aren't the only winners. Stocks that have some connection to Ethereum or Ethereum mining have also received a boost from investors. Here are the three top Ethereum stocks in 2017.
Unlike bitcoin, which is treasured by digital-currency enthusiasts and investors for its payment potential, the Ether token isn't all that popular as a form of payment -- at least not yet. It's possible it could be used to facilitate real-time transactions in the future, but that's not where Ethereum investors are currently focused.
Instead, the money is being made by mining Ethereum, which is a far less intensive process than mining bitcoin at the moment. Still, mining Ethereum and getting paid for solving complex equations and verifying transactions requires some heavy-duty technology. That technology includes high-powered graphics cards from the likes of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).
According to a test run by HotHardware in June, NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card delivered the second-highest hash rate (a measure of calculation speed) of the eight graphics cards tested, and it looks to be the best overall with regard to performance per watt. Remember, mining cryptocurrencies can be a costly venture, and not just because of the hardware purchases involved. Electricity costs can be nothing to sneeze at. 
Long story short, NVIDIA has witnessed a surge in its gaming segment revenue, which incorporates graphics cards sold for gaming purposes, as well as cryptocurrency mining. Though the company doesn't break out how much of its sales are related to mining, it's pretty clearly seeing positive benefits from the rise of Ethereum. Shares of the company are up 101% year to date.

Along the same lines as NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which is better known as AMD, has also taken advantage of rising graphics card demand.
AMD is perhaps best known for its all-out war against Intel over microprocessor market share in personal computers (PCs) in the 1990s and 2000s. However, given the decline in standard PC usage and the rise in mobile devices, AMD has turned its attention elsewhere. The company's graphics card unit has become a major player in gaming, as well as in mining various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.
According to the aforementioned HotHardware study, even though NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1070 looks to be the best all-around graphics card for performance per watt, AMD's Radeon series graphics cards were right behind NVIDIA's. Virtual-currency miners probably aren't seeing meaningful differences in cost or performance between AMD and NVIDIA, meaning both can benefit.
As noted in AMD's third-quarter operating results in October, computing and graphics sales grew by 74% year over year, with the average selling price of its graphics cards rising ""significantly"" year over year. The only reason its graphics card sales would rise significantly is if higher-powered units were being sold, which would signify strong demand from virtual-currency miners. 
Though AMD shares are relatively flat this year, they're up 388% over the trailing-two-year period.

Another top stock that's been somewhat linked to Ethereum's success is online retailer Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK). Overstock has been at the forefront of the digital-currency revolution, and it's the first major company to accept what could be described as the six most popular digital currencies: bitcoin, Ethereum, bitcoin cash, LiteCoin, Monero, and Dash. As noted, Ether tokens aren't exactly a popular choice for paying for goods and services, but Ether can be used to buy items through Overstock's website.
However, it's pretty much impossible to understand how much Ethereum's move higher has really impacted Overstock, given its gung-ho nature toward all cryptocurrencies. A subsidiary of the company is currently working on a project, the Medici t0 blockchain, which is a blockchain-based securities-lending system that could be cheaper and more efficient than the software Wall Street currently has in place. The expectation of an initial coin offering from this development, which might be the largest ever, along with Overstock's being tethered to around a half-dozen cryptocurrencies via its website (the company generally retains a small percentage of its virtual currencies, as opposed to converting them to U.S. dollars), has transformed it into a highly volatile crypto-driven stock. 
Shares of Overstock.com have jumped by more than 215% since the year began.

            ","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) literally owns the market for server chips. Over 99% of data centers run computers powered by Chipzilla's silicon, creating a big entry barrier for any would-be competitor. But this hasn't deterred other chipmakers from trying their hand at server chips in the hope that they can make a dent in a market that's expected to grow at 5% a year until 2020, hitting a projected $20 billion in revenue.
Earlier this year, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) made waves when it claimed that its EPYC server chips can outperform Intel's offerings thanks to superior specs. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is the latest company to join the bandwagon, claiming that its Centriq line of server processors can do better than Intel at a price point that's way lower. So, should Intel start quaking in its boots? Let's find out.
Image Source: Intel. 
Qualcomm's Centriq server chip is based on the ARM platform, and it is being manufactured using the 10nm fabrication process by Samsung. Qualcomm claims that the Centriq 2400 processor family is the ""first high-performance Arm-based processor series designed to offer groundbreaking throughput performance for cloud workloads running in today's datacenters,"" and it has been designed to deliver ""exceptional performance-per-watt and performance-per dollar.""
The more important thing to note is that Qualcomm has spent over four years to develop its server processor family with the intention of currying favor with service providers. The good news is that Qualcomm's expertise in making chips and brand equity has helped its new chip family get off the ground.
The chipmaker has managed to get the likes of Alibaba, Alphabet, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and Microsoft on board to test the Centriq processors. 
Given that Qualcomm has already started commercial shipments of Centriq, these chips will now be evaluated by its partners to see if they can really deliver.  It might be a year before we start seeing deployments on a large scale.
But Qualcomm investors have strong reasons to remain upbeat about the future of Centriq as the chips have massively undercut Intel's Xeon server processors in terms of pricing. The most expensive Centriq 2460 processor retails for $1,995, while the most expensive Intel Xeon Platinum processor carries a price of just over $10,000.
One of Qualcomm's benchmark tests indicates that its top-of-the-line Centriq processor can match the performance of the Intel Xeon Platinum in terms of single-thread performance, and at a far lower power consumption rating (120 watts versus Intel's 205 watts). This could be a big advantage for Qualcomm over Intel as servers reportedly account for 30% of a data center's power consumption.
Additionally, Qualcomm's Centriq can outperform Intel's processors in multi-threading workloads as well, according to content delivery provider Cloudflare. If Centriq can replicate such performances in the real world, there's no doubt that they will witness strong demand from hyperscale data centers.
A hyperscale data center requires more processing power per square millimeter and low per-watt power consumption, so Centriq seems ideal. According to TechNavio, the global hyperscale data center market is expected to grow at an annual pace of 11% from 2016 to 2021.
AMD has been making a lot of noise with its EPYC server chips in recent months. After claiming that these chips are better than Intel's Xeon server chips earlier this year, AMD has managed to land a few big-name clients.
For instance, Chinese cloud giants Tencent, JD.com, and Baidu have already  deployed EPYC chips in their data centers. Moreover, AMD made another big announcement recently when it revealed that its EPYC processors have helped Hewlett-Packard Enterprise slash costs at one of its servers by as much as 50%.
With this deployment, AMD is now supplying its EPYC processors to two of HPE's servers, indicating that the chipmaker's server business is indeed gaining traction. Additionally, AMD has deployed a smart strategy of undercutting Intel on pricing across its entire chipset range. For instance, the EPYC 7601 processor priced at $4,200 is over $500 cheaper than an Intel Xeon 8160 chip, and also offers more cores, making them ideal to process resource-hungry workloads.
Therefore, it won't be surprising to see more infrastructure providers using AMD's EPYC server chips in their data centers. This sounds like bad news for Intel as both AMD and Qualcomm are trying to hit the former on pricing and trying to match the performance of Chipzilla's offerings as well.
It is still early to see how much damage Qualcomm and AMD can do to Intel in the server space. But Chipzilla investors have a good reason to remain concerned as rivals have now set the wheels in motion, and could hurt its supremacy if they can execute their product development moves with aplomb.

            ","Following the launch earlier this year of the desktop variants of Ryzen, Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) latest generation of CPUs, the first products powered by the mobile variants are starting to hit the market. AMD officially unveiled Ryzen Mobile in October, announcing the Ryzen 7 2700U and the less powerful Ryzen 5 2500U. These chips feature AMD's Vega graphics, providing substantially improved graphics performance compared to the company's previous generation of mobile processors.
The HP Envy x360 is the first Ryzen Mobile laptop to become available, powered by the Ryzen 5 2500U. The Tech Report ran it through its paces, comparing it to a few configurations of the Acer Swift 3, all powered by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs and one featuring a discrete NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) MX150 GPU.
One thing is clear from the review: The success of Ryzen Mobile will depend on pricing. The Envy x360 configuration tested was $760, a bit more than the current $719 price tag on Amazon for the Swift 3 with NVIDIA graphics. Priced in the same ballpark, the Intel-NVIDIA option is the clear winner for gaming.
Image source: AMD.
Based on The Tech Report's testing, the Ryzen 5 2500U trounces the integrated graphics built into Intel's chips. In some cases, games go from being unplayable on the Intel-only system to playable on the AMD system. This isn't surprising -- Intel's integrated graphics have never been particularly good for gaming.
The Ryzen 5 chip represents ""good enough"" gaming performance. The problem is, for the same price, gamers can get a more powerful system with NVIDIA graphics. In all of the gaming tests, the system with the MX150 graphics chip handily beats the Ryzen system, sometimes by 50% or more in terms of average frame rate.
It's not surprising that a discrete graphics chip beats the integrated graphics in the Ryzen system. But I'm not sure why someone interested in gaming on a laptop, given the choice between a Ryzen Mobile system and an Intel-NVIDIA system for roughly the same price, would opt for Ryzen Mobile.
The story may change as more Ryzen Mobile laptops become available. At a lower price, a system like the Envy x360 would offer a compelling, and cheaper, alternative to an Intel-NVIDIA system. All of the games tested were playable on the Ryzen system, and there's certainly a market for gaming laptops that provide just enough oomph to get the job done.
Beyond gaming, Ryzen Mobile lags Intel in terms of single-threaded performance. The same story played out with AMD's desktop Ryzen chips. Single-threaded performance is important for general responsiveness, app start-up times, and any case where multiple cores can't be fully utilized. In The Tech Report's tests involving web browsing, app start-up, and productivity software, the Ryzen 5 chip came in dead last. In the case of productivity software, it fell short of the Intel-based systems by a wide margin.
For those interested primarily in gaming, the single-threaded shortcomings may not matter. But as a general-purpose laptop, the Ryzen 5 system doesn't justify its price.
AMD isn't going to pick up much laptop market share if the pricing on all Ryzen laptops is similar to the Envy x360. For those not interested in gaming, an Intel laptop with integrated graphics offers better performance for everyday computing tasks. For gamers, a similarly priced laptop with discrete NVIDIA graphics offers substantially better gaming performance. I'm not sure where Ryzen 5 really fits in.
Cheaper Ryzen 5 laptops may be on the horizon, which could change the story. Lop $100 to $200 off, and a Ryzen 5 laptop makes a whole lot more sense as a gaming laptop, and it's much more competitive as a general-purpose laptop. But if prices end up in line with the Envy x360, Intel and NVIDIA probably don't have too much to worry about.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reentered the high-end graphics card market earlier this year when it launched Vega, its highly anticipated attack on NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance. The RX Vega 64 and RX Vega 56 caught up to NVIDIA in terms of performance, but they used far more power than comparable NVIDIA products, which had been on the market for over a year. Vega was a catch-up play from AMD, not the home run that investors were hoping for.
According to Jon Peddie Research, Vega failed to provide a boost to AMD's market share. In fact, AMD lost discrete GPU unit market share in the third quarter, compared to both the previous quarter and the prior-year quarter. The market for graphics cards grew by more than 20% year over year, so AMD still managed to grow its GPU sales. But its position weakened relative to NVIDIA.
Image source: AMD.
As recently as 2014, AMD enjoyed a discrete GPU unit market share of roughly 40%. NVIDIA accounted for the remaining 60%, but AMD was a strong No. 2 player. This dynamic ended in the latter half of 2014 when NVIDIA launched the GeForce 900 series. The GTX 970 and GTX 980 came in September of that year, with the mainstream GTX 960 following in January. The rest of the lineup was filled in throughout 2015.
These products were disruptive, dramatically undercutting AMD's own products on price. A look at the market share data shows the upheaval.
Chart by author. Data source: Jon Peddie Research.
AMD's unit market share was essentially cut in half between the second quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2015. At its lowest, it fell below 20%.
AMD regained some ground in mid-2016, aided by the launch of its mainstream Polaris GPUs. Polaris targeted the $200-and-under portion of the market, leaving the high end uncontested. AMD's unit market share rose to around 30% and stayed there. That move marked progress, but with no competitive high-end products, the most lucrative portion of the market was out of reach.
Vega is the latest step in AMD's plan to regain its former position in the graphics card industry. NVIDIA's GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 were in AMD's crosshairs when Vega launched in August.
But Vega failed to live up to the hype. Instead of leapfrogging NVIDIA's year-old products, Vega provided similar performance and much worse power efficiency. AMD's unit market share in the third quarter slumped to 27.2%, down from 30.3% in the second quarter and 29.8% in the third quarter of 2016.
Things will get even tougher for AMD's graphics business in 2018 and beyond. NVIDIA is expected to launch graphics cards based on its next-generation Volta architecture sometime next year. Volta is already shipping for data center products, but NVIDIA hasn't yet brought the architecture over to the gaming market. When Volta-based graphics cards do launch, AMD's Vega will fall even further behind.
A longer-term problem for AMD is Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The PC CPU giant announced in November that it was developing its own discrete graphics solutions, with the new core and visual computing group led by Raja Koduri. Koduri was poached from AMD, where he led the Radeon Technologies Group responsible for bringing Vega to market.
The GPU duopoly that has allowed AMD to retain a sizable market share despite its floundering performance in recent years is getting a third player. Intel's first discrete graphics product probably isn't coming anytime soon, but it has the potential to shake up the industry. That shake-up is unlikely to be in AMD's favor.
AMD's graphics business looks stuck. Growth in the overall market, partially driven by demand related to cryptocurrency mining, helped the company post solid third-quarter results in October. But Vega hasn't provided a market share boost. With NVIDIA's Volta on the horizon, and with Intel set to join the fray, AMD's market share may never fully recover.

            ","2017 was a great year for the semiconductor industry thanks to robust demand for chips across multiple industries. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rallied 46% this year, easily beating the S&P 500's 15% gain.
Some shining stars, like Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY), even outperformed the index -- Cypress itself grew nearly 50% this year. Yet there were also laggards, like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), which stayed nearly flat this year after being one of the hottest chip stocks of 2016.
Image source: Getty Images.
I previously compared these two chipmakers back in February, and concluded that Cypress was a better pick thanks to its better-diversified business, wider moat, and decent dividend. Today, we'll reexamine both companies to see if Cypress is still a better buy than AMD after its year-long rally.
Cypress produces a wide range of analog and memory chips for the automotive, industrial, home automation, medical devices, and consumer electronics markets. Most of its recent growth comes through acquisitions. It merged with embedded chipmaker Spansion in 2015, then acquired Broadcom's Internet of Things (IoT) business last year.
Cypress reports its revenue in two segments: the MCD (microcontroller and connectivity division), which sells analog, wireless, and wired connectivity chips; and the MPD (memory products division), which produces NOR, NAND, SRAM, F-RAM, and other types of specialty memory chips. The MCD unit generated 62% of its sales last quarter, while the MPD unit accounted for the remaining 38%.
AMD is the world's second biggest supplier of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs. It directly competes against Intel and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), which respectively lead the CPU and GPU markets. Those two businesses are placed together in AMD's Computing and Graphics unit, which generated half its revenues last quarter.
The other half of its revenues came from its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which provides custom SoCs (system on chips) for gaming consoles and other devices.
Cypress' revenues rose 20% to $1.92 billion last year thanks to a combination of robust chip demand, a transition toward higher-margin chips, and its inorganic growth strategy. Analysts expect its sales to rise another 20% this year, then cool off to 7% growth next year as year-over-year comparisons stabilize.

On the bottom line, Cypress' non-GAAP earnings are expected to grow 76% this year and 38% next year. Cypress attributes that growth to the expansion of the IoT market lifting demand for its connected chips, which provide Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity to a wide range of devices -- including Nintendo's popular Switch console.
Cypress' chips are also widely used in crash avoidance systems and infotainment platforms in connected cars. Looking ahead, Cypress expects demand for its industry-leading USB-C charging platform to grow as more device makers switch to the newer standard.
AMD's revenues rose 7% to $4.27 billion last year, as the strength of its EESC business (propped up by the PS4 and Xbox One) complemented solid demand for its Radeon GPUs. Analysts expect its revenues to rise 23% this year, fueled by strong sales of its new Vega GPUs and Ryzen CPUs against NVIDIA and Intel's current-gen chips.
But looking ahead, AMD's outlook gets murkier, since NVIDIA and Intel are already striking back with newer and faster chips. That's why analysts expect AMD's revenue growth to drop to 12% next year. But on the bottom line, AMD's non-GAAP earnings are expected to improve 193% this year and 169% next year as it returns to profitability.
Cypress trades at 14 times next year's earnings, while AMD has a forward P/E of 39. Cypress is also much better at generating free cash flow (despite all its recent acquisitions) than AMD.

Source: YCharts
That's why Cypress pays a forward yield of 2.7%, while AMD has never paid a dividend. Cypress only raised that payout once since it introduced the dividend in 2011, but it's still a decent bonus for patient investors.
It's easy to see why investors favored Cypress over AMD this year -- the former has a well-diversified business which rides high on positive trends like the IoT, connected cars, and higher memory prices, while the latter remains sandwiched between NVIDIA and Intel. When we consider that Cypress also has a lower forward multiple and pays a decent dividend, the choice becomes clear: Cypress wins again.

            ","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) sprung a big surprise when it said that it is going to work with archrival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to manufacture a high-end notebook chip aimed at the enthusiast market. This unlikely partnership could pose trouble for NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), denting its chances in the notebook space as Intel and AMD are going to offer a sleek and powerful chip package to curry favor with laptop OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).
So, should this venture give NVIDIA sleepless nights, or will it be able to overcome the Intel-AMD combine?
Intel plans to combine its laptop-gaming focused Core H-series processors with a custom-made AMD GPU (graphics processing unit). This multi-processor chip package will also be equipped with AMD's second-generation high bandwidth memory (HBM2), and use Intel's Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) power-sharing framework to help the chips quickly communicate with each other.

The connection established by this power-sharing framework will use software drivers to coordinate information among the three chips to deliver optimum performance in real time, while managing the system's temperature and power consumption based on the workload. Therefore, this combined system-on-a-chip will allow laptop manufacturers to offer a longer battery life, especially because of the addition of HBM2 in place of GDDR5 RAM (random access memory).
Discrete GPU systems have long used dedicated graphics memory such as GDDR5, but the efficiency of this technology is waning because of an increase in memory bandwidth requirements. GDDR5 memory is said to consume a lot of power in case the memory bandwidth of a GPU increases, which constrains the performance of the chip.
Intel wants to solve this problem with the help of HBM2, which stacks memory chips in a vertical format. This allows for smaller form factors and faster flow of information between the CPU and the GPU. Therefore, the deployment of HBM2 along with a CPU-GPU combine on the same chip package will free up a lot of space.
Now, laptop OEMs can use this space to either make thinner devices, or pack in features such as a bigger battery package or a more efficient cooling system to elongate battery life. So, it won't be surprising if Intel-AMD's combined offering hits the ground running when it starts shipping in the first quarter of 2018.
Intel hasn't revealed anything apart from the concept, so the tech specs of the new chip package are still some time away. However, it is unlikely that AMD will be selling its latest GPU architecture to Intel given the rivalry between the two companies in the CPU market, as well as for technical reasons.
AMD and Intel are engaged in an intense fight for CPU market share. AMD recently launched its Ryzen Mobile processors that come integrated with the latest Vega graphics platform, and the company's internal tests indicate that they can outperform Intel's chips by a wide margin. More importantly, the chipmaker is trying to offer a mix of powerful performance and long battery life through the Ryzen Mobile platform.
AMD claims that a system based on the Ryzen 7 mobile chip can deliver over 12 hours of full high-definition video playback. By comparison, the Kaby Lake architecture-based Core H-series reportedly delivers 9.5 hours of video playback, so it is unlikely that AMD will have cannibalized its own sales as a part of the Intel deal.
Not surprisingly, rumors suggest that AMD will be supplying GPUs to Intel based on the older Polaris platform to keep its own product line one generation ahead of Intel. This could be the opening that NVIDIA needs to maintain its dominance in the discrete GPU space, as OEMs are busy rolling out laptops based on the graphics specialist's top-of-the-line GTX 1080 GPU.
Additionally, NVIDIA's Max-Q design allows laptop manufacturers to create thinner, faster, and quieter gaming devices. In fact, a laptop equipped with the GTX 1080 graphics card and the Max-Q design can perform 1.7 times faster than the company's older generation card. More importantly, the Max-Q design enables OEMs to deploy NVIDIA's GeForce GTX GPUs in laptops as thin as 18mm.
This is far lower than the 26mm average of devices based on Intel's Core H-series processors. Therefore, there is no real reason for NVIDIA investors to worry as it can offer its latest graphics cards in laptops with a slim profile. By comparison, the Intel-AMD combine might come out with an older discrete graphics platform given the competitive dynamics between the two companies, paving the way for NVIDIA to maintain its dominance in the GPU market.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of the hottest tech stocks of 2016, surging nearly 430% on its recovering chip sales. But 2017 was a different story. After climbing another 30% by March, the stock stalled out -- and then reversed course following its third quarter earnings report in late October.
AMD has now declined 22% over the past month, erasing all of its year-to-date gains and casting serious doubts on the former tech darling's long-term growth. Let's look back at what went wrong for AMD, and whether or not it can turn things back around.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD bulls believed that the company's x86 chipmaking business could challenge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) again with its new Ryzen chips, while its discrete GPU business would gain ground against NVIDIA (NASDAQ:INTC) with its newer Vega-based GPUs.
For a while, it seemed like AMD's plan would work. The new Ryzen CPUs offered performance comparable to that of Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake CPUs at lower prices. Major companies, including Microsoft and Baidu, agreed to install AMD's higher-end Epyc CPUs into their data centers -- which could potentially loosen Intel's near-monopoly on the server chip market. AMD also plans to hit Intel in the mobile market with Mobile Ryzen CPUs, which integrate Vega graphics directly into laptop CPUs.
AMD's new Vega-based Radeon GPUs also offered comparable performance to NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal cards. It also launched a high-end workstation card, the Radeon Vega Frontier Edition, to challenge NVIDIA in the enterprise market. Sales of its GPUs also enjoyed a minor boost from the cryptocurrency mining craze.
Meanwhile, the bulls believed that updated versions of the Xbox One and the PS4 would boost sales of AMD's custom SoCs, which power both consoles. Those three core businesses would prop up AMD's revenue growth, and any seasonal weakness in one could be offset by growth in the others.
On the surface, AMD's growth still looks superb. Its revenue rose 25% annually last quarter as its non-GAAP net income surged more than 300%. It also posted a GAAP net income of $71 million, compared to a loss in the prior year quarter. Analysts expect its revenue and non-GAAP earnings to respectively rise 23% and 193% this year.
However, most AMD investors didn't count on Intel and NVIDIA hitting back so hard. Intel initially teamed up with AMD to create Radeon-branded graphics cores and built-in video memory for a new chipset, which seemed like a win-win situation for both companies and a losing one for NVIDIA.
But shortly afterwards, Intel announced the creation of a new Core and Visual Computing group to create discrete GPUs -- and hired Raja Koduri, AMD's former senior president and chief architect of Radeon, as its new leader. This was clearly bad news for AMD and NVIDIA, and both stocks plunged after the announcement.

Intel also introduced its new Coffee Lake chips (the final 14nm Skylake refresh), which pulled ahead of Ryzen again in terms of raw performance in mainstream desktops. Intel's Skylake-X also countered AMD's Threadripper (two eight-core Ryzen CPUs joined by AMD's Infinity Fabric) in the high-end market, albeit at a much higher price.
Meanwhile, AMD's Vega chips offered comparable performance to NVIDIA's Pascal chips, but the prices were also comparable -- which limited their overall appeal. NVIDIA also introduced its next-gen Volta GPU for enterprise users. Once the mainstream version of Volta arrives next year, AMD could struggle to match NVIDIA's blows. Lastly, NVIDIA stole the console show by securing the SoC spot in Nintendo's Switch, which has been outselling the Xbox One and PS4 over the past few months.
Analysts expect these headwinds to throttle AMD's growth, with its revenue and earnings respectively rising 13% and 169% next year. Those numbers aren't bad, but they would represent a significant slowdown from its growth in 2016.
Moreover, the stock doesn't seem particularly cheap at 38 times next year's earnings, which is higher than Intel's forward P/E of 14 but only slightly lower than NVIDIA's forward P/E of 42. As a result, AMD's stock is priced for perfection, but the chipmaker could struggle to meet investors' lofty expectations.

            ","The news that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) would supply semi-custom graphics chips to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for use in a new product aimed at notebooks was surprising when it broke earlier this month. There had been rumors of an Intel-AMD licensing deal earlier this year, which seemed far-fetched at the time. This deal involves AMD selling chips to Intel, with no licensing of technology or patents, but it still validates the spirit of the rumor.
It originally seemed like a strange move for Intel, which competes with AMD in the PC and server CPU markets. It made more sense a few days later, when Intel announced that Raja Koduri, chief architect of the Radeon Technologies Group at AMD, was jumping ship to Intel. Through its new Core and Visual Computing Group, Intel plans to develop discrete graphics solutions of its own. Putting AMD graphics into Intel products is a stopgap measure, not a long-term strategy.
Image source: AMD.
AMD's enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment is mostly comprised of the semi-custom chips used in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game consoles. As those consoles reach the back half of their life cycles, revenue and profits from those chips are set to decline. This deal with Intel to provide semi-custom graphics chips, in addition to AMD's new server processors, can help offset those declines.
AMD launched its own mobile processors recently, called Ryzen Mobile, which feature the company's Vega graphics cores. It's unclear whether AMD is supplying Vega-based graphics chips for the Intel product, or if it opted for the mainstream Polaris. I would assume that AMD wouldn't enable a product that would compete with its new Ryzen Mobile chips directly. There's been some speculation that this Intel-AMD chip is for Apple. If that's the case, it would make a lot more sense for AMD to provide Vega-based chips, as all Macs run on Intel processors.
Either way, this deal will put Radeon graphics in more devices, and it will generate some additional revenue for AMD. Exactly how much revenue depends on where this Intel chip ends up. If Apple uses it across its Mac product line, it could certainly move the needle for AMD. Apple sold more than 5 million Mac units in its fourth quarter alone.
But don't count on this new revenue stream to stick around. Intel's push into discrete graphics makes it unlikely that an Intel CPU paired with an AMD GPU will become the norm.
The market for discrete graphics chips used for PC gaming and accelerating enterprise workloads is dominated by NVIDIA, with AMD attempting to make a comeback with Vega. The duopoly in graphics is a lot like the duopoly in PC CPUs, with Intel dominating and AMD a distant second.
A third player entering the graphics business is unequivocally bad news for AMD. The company has had enough trouble competing with NVIDIA. Another competitor, especially one with the resources of Intel, spells trouble.
The full scope of Intel's plans and the timing of its first discrete graphics product are unclear at this point. Intel plans to build ""high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing segments,"" which implies that it will go after both the gaming and enterprise markets. The gaming PC market is an oasis of growth within an otherwise slumping market for PCs, and NVIDIA manages some incredible margins by dominating the high end. NVIDIA also dominates the enterprise accelerator market, with data-center revenue now on a $2 billion annual run rate. That's too big for Intel to ignore.
AMD's task of making a comeback in graphics will get a lot harder once Intel is shipping products. That may still be a few years away, and for now, AMD will enjoy some extra revenue from the Intel deal. But these developments collectively are a net negative for AMD.

            ","When the dust finally settles and the calendar changes over to 2018, investors are likely to look back on 2017 as the year of the cryptocurrency. Having begun the year with a $17.65 billion aggregate valuation, the market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined reached $199.37 billion as of Nov. 4. That's a year-to-date return of 1,030%. To put this in some context, it's taken the broad-based S&P 500 decades to return more than 1,000%, but the average digital currency has done so in roughly 10 months.
Leading the way, even though it's ""underperformed"" its digital peers this year, is bitcoin. After beginning the year below $1,000 per coin, bitcoin recently surged as high as $7,500, marking a gain through the first 10 months and four days of roughly 675%. Its current market cap of $122 billion comprises more than 60% of the aggregate market cap of the nearly 1,200 virtual currencies, and it's left investors wondering if bitcoin stocks could be the next hottest thing.

Pushing bitcoin higher has been a mix of fundamental, emotional, and news-driven events. Fundamentally, investors are excited about the potential for blockchain, the underlying technology of many cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. This digital and decentralized ledger records transactions without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank, and it's expected to be a major step forward in security for the financial services industry.
Emotionally, bitcoin has appealed to retail investors who don't want to miss the boat. These once-in-a-lifetime gains have attracted investors, big and small, but it's mostly kept institutional investors relegated to the sidelines because of the unregulated nature of the currency.
More recently, news has been the biggest price driver. An upgrade to bitcoin's blockchain during this past summer is expected to attract enterprise customers, while news released last week that the CME Group will be listing bitcoin futures for trading by the end of the year sent its price blasting higher. The entrance of institutional investors through futures trading should help calm bitcoin's wild volatility, and perhaps improve liquidity. 
Image source: Getty Images.
The big question for many investors is how they can take advantage of bitcoin without having to actually buy bitcoin. After all, until those future contracts are up and running on CME Group's exchange, buying and selling bitcoin can only be done on decentralized exchanges, which often have wild volatility and potentially limited liquidity. The following stocks offer some degree of correlation to bitcoin, but not all are worthy of consideration.
In theory, the most direct correlation to bitcoin should be found with the Bitcoin Investment Trust (NASDAQOTH:GBTC), run by Grayscale. This is a relatively passive fund that owns bitcoin and gives investors a potentially more liquid approach to investing in the virtual currency through their broker.
As of the end of October 2017, the Bitcoin Investment Trust held 172,144 coins, which at $7,390 would be worth $1.27 billion. However, the trust ended Nov. 3 with a market cap of $1.62 billion, representing a 28% premium to the current price. There's really no explanation for this premium, other than improved liquidity over decentralized exchanges, but that doesn't really merit a premium of this magnitude. Tack on a steep 2% annual management fee for a Trust that has virtually no active management, and this has all the hallmarks of a dangerous investment.

Perhaps no publicly traded company has gone all-in with virtual currencies more than online retailer Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK). In addition to being the only major retailer to accept bitcoin, Ethereum, bitcoin cash, Litecoin, Monero, and Dash, it's also on the cusp of what could be a $500 million initial coin offering through subsidiary tZero (t0). The build-out of the Medici t0 blockchain is incredibly exciting because it's designed to be a blockchain-based securities lending system that goes head-to-head with Wall Street at a more efficient and cheaper rate. 
But is Overstock worth considering as a bitcoin stock? Honestly, the company has struggled to deliver consistent growth, and as of now its virtual currency blockchain operations are costing it money rather than helping. That isn't to say things won't change, but Overstock.com comes with a lot of inherent risks to investors.

Another ""bitcoin stock"" is video graphics giant NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Though the company is well known for its high-powered graphics cards for the gaming industry, it turns out that these graphic cards come in particularly handy when mining cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately for investors, NVIDIA doesn't break out what percentage of revenue is derived from virtual currency mining, which leaves Wall Street guessing. Nonetheless, record high after record high for bitcoin and its peers are bound to continue attracting new miners, which could be a good thing for NVIDIA.
But the real investment thesis with NVIDIA revolves around the cloud and data centers. With enterprises moving into the digital realm, the demand for data is only expected to increase, which should provide NVIDIA with a double-digit percentage annual growth opportunity. NVIDIA isn't a cheap stock by any means, but it appears to be on considerably more solid ground than Overstock or the Bitcoin Investment Trust.
Image source: Getty Images.
The same could be said for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), or AMD as it's more commonly known. Traditionally known as a chipmaker and the biggest rival to Intel in the personal-computing market, AMD has switched gears in recent years and focused its efforts on the expanding graphics card arena. Like NVIDIA above, AMD has benefited from a surge in sales to virtual currency miners with cryptocurrencies hitting all-time highs. While neither AMD nor NVIDIA specifically benefit in a big way from bitcoin mining anymore, with a more specialized chipset known as ASIC handling mining of the most popular digital currency, other currencies like Monero, LiteCoin, and Ethereum are still popular mining destinations for AMD graphic-card users. 
But is AMD really a bitcoin stock to considering buying? Maybe not, considering that its legacy PC business is struggling mightily. It would probably also be difficult to keep up its recent rapid growth derived from virtual currency mining.
Image source: Getty Images.
In terms of the worst bitcoin stock, I give you the over-the-counter-traded First Bitcoin Capital Corp. (NASDAQOTH:BITCF). This company describes itself as a developer of virtual currencies, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrency exchanges, but it's generally produced nothing but losses since its inception. Having only recently become a digital currency-focused company, First Bitcoin Capital previously owned mineral rights in Venezuela. In other words, it made quite the logistical jump back in 2014 from a gold-focused company to a completely new mode of business.
Recently, the company faced a two-week trading halt initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and it had the first-ever cryptocurrency dividend put on hold because of the somehow unforeseen complications of issuing a virtual currency as a dividend. Though it has bitcoin in the name, this company is no way emblematic of the gains bitcoin has seen in 2017. Stay far away. 
In other words, there really aren't any bitcoin stocks worth buying as an alternative for investing in bitcoin. NVIDIA appears to be the strongest of the bunch, but its strength lies with expectations for cloud and data-center growth, not cryptocurrency mining or anything having to do with bitcoin. Since my opinion is that bitcoin is looking more like a bubble by the day, I'd suggest investors keep their distance.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have taken a  beating in recent trading sessions, with the stock down 21% since Oct. 23. First, a negative analyst note from Citi Research dented investor confidence going into the company's third-quarter results. Analyst Christopher Danely slapped a $5 price target on the stock that closed Oct. 23 at $14.10 and reiterated his ""sell"" rating, citing intense competition after the recent launch of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) eight-generation processors.
Then, investors pressed the panic button despite AMD's terrific quarterly report and consensus-topping guidance on Oct. 24 , sending the stock down more than 13% after the results were released. This makes it evident that investors are having second thoughts about the chipmaker's ability to deliver growth in the face of increased competition from the likes of Intel and NVIDIA, who have released new chips to arrest AMD's rise.
But a closer look makes it clear that the recent stock price crash could be an opportunity in disguise.
Image Source: AMD 
According to Citi Research analyst Danely, as reported by CNBC, Intel's latest Coffee Lake CPUs (central processing units) have extended its technology lead. That makes sense as the latest Intel processors pack six cores, up from four in the previous generation, and are built on Chipzilla's third-generation 14nm technology.
More importantly, the Intel processors are reportedly beating Ryzen, according to some third-party testing, but there is a twist. The Coffee Lake chips aren't compatible with existing Z270 and Z170 motherboards, so users will have to upgrade their chipsets to run the new processors.
This is the case because the new Coffee Lake processors could outperform the Ryzen chips only with the help of extra power from a newly designed motherboard socket. In case a Coffee Lake processor is run on an older motherboard, users won't be able to exploit the full potential of the new CPUs.
This could be an obstacle for Coffee Lake sales as Intel is expected to launch the first batch of its Cannon Lake processors in June or July of 2018 and these will be based on the 10nm technology, so they are expected to deliver a massive jump in performance and reduce power consumption substantially thanks to a smaller die size.
Therefore, the potential launch of Intel's next-generation platform within a year of Coffee Lake, as well as the lack of backward compatibility with existing chipsets could hurt its adoption. That's good news for AMD investors. Moreover, the competing Ryzen processors undercut the Coffee Lake lineup on pricing, so it is too early to say if Intel can put a stop to AMD's juggernaut in the CPU space.
Danely also said -- in a note that came out before AMD reported its latest earnings -- that AMD is losing money despite the launch of new products this year. But the company's third-quarter results indicated otherwise. The chipmaker posted GAAP net income of $71 million as compared to a huge loss of $406 million last year, driven by an increase in sales of its GPUs and CPUs in the premium desktop market.
More specifically, AMD saw a spike in the average selling prices of both CPUs and GPUs last quarter, and this led to a 4-percentage point increase in the company's gross margin. Furthermore, the chipmaker's operating margin shot up 4.1 percentage points year over year even as operating expenses increased 18%.
So the statement that AMD's latest products aren't helping the company make money doesn't hold water anymore. Looking ahead, the chipmaker could post sustained profits thanks to a spike in CPU sales.
Moreover, AMD has just started shipping its notebook-centric Ryzen CPUs, with full deployment expected by the first quarter of next year, so it has another avenue to grow its market share.
Danely's $5 price target for AMD stock doesn't make much sense as its revenue and earnings are expected to get better. The company has raised its full-year revenue guidance and AMD is expected to report non-GAAP earnings of $0.13 per share this year, which could increase to $0.35 per share in the next fiscal year, according to analyst estimates.
AMD's earnings expansion depends on its ability to keep snatching market share from rivals. It has been making the right moves in this regard by scoring wins in NVIDIA's stronghold, and is touted to win share from Intel in the server market post the launch of its EPYC chips. Finally, AMD's latest quarterly report is proof that the company's new products are delivering results. Investors should stop panicking.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) failed to impress Wall Street in late October despite posting strong third-quarter results and a decent outlook, with revenue jumping 25% year over year and net income skyrocketing to $110 million from last year's $27 million. AMD shares plunged 13% the day after the results came out as the company didn't provide much clarity about future sales.
The company skipped providing details about a recently closed patent licensing deal, keeping investors in the dark about how much it is contributing to its revenue and earnings. This sparked speculation that AMD's new chips aren't selling as well as expected, and it might have missed estimates if there was no licensing deal in place.

But there was enough in AMD's latest earnings report to indicate that the company is progressing in the right direction to enhance its revenue and earnings in the long run. Let's take a closer look at the three important points made by management.
AMD posted GAAP net income of $71 million during the third quarter as compared to a massive loss of $406 million in the prior-year period. This was the chipmaker's first profitable quarter in three years (barring the second quarter of 2016 when asset sales inflated earnings), and was driven by the company's strategy of targeting the high-end PC market.
More specifically, high-end GPUs account for less than15% of sales, but they bring in 66% of the margins. On the other hand, server processors present another potentially fertile ground for AMD as chips in this space sell for a premium.
The average selling price (ASP) of AMD's processors rose last quarter thanks to the introduction of Ryzen CPUs (central processing units). Similarly, the newly introduced Vega line-up led to a ""significant"" increase in graphics processing unit (GPU) ASP.
The higher ASP helped AMD increase its non-GAAP gross margin by 4 percentage points from the year-ago quarter to 35%. Furthermore, the company's operating margin shot up to 9.4% last quarter from just 5.3% in the year-ago period despite an 18% jump in operating expenses. Therefore, AMD's new product line-up is helping it make a dent in high-end chips and pushing the company closer toward sustained profitability.
AMD launched the EPYC server chip with much fanfare earlier this year to challenge Intel's dominance in this space, and it looks like the company is making good progress.
""In a short period, three of the Super 7 mega data center providers have publicly announced plans to deploy EPYC-based products into their Hyperscale environments, including Baidu, Microsoft Azure and Tencent,"" according to CEO Lisa Su. The CEO went on to add that ""HP Enterprise and Dell are in the process of bringing their first EPYC-based platforms to market in Q4.""
And AMD's chips have been chosen by five of the biggest data center and cloud service providers. This includes cloud computing leader Amazon, which recently decided to move away from NVIDIA by using AMD's FirePro server GPUs for the AppStream 2.0 service. Therefore, AMD's datacenter business looks set to get better thanks to its recent design wins in both server CPUs and GPUs.
AMD's improving traction in the data center business should eventually help it boost its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business that struggled last quarter. Revenue from this segment was flat year over year, but operating income nosedived 38% as sales of semi-custom processors to console manufacturers Sony and Microsoft took a hit due to seasonality.
Looking ahead, semi-custom chip sales are expected to continue struggling in the fourth quarter, but the launch of EPYC datacenter platforms by HP and Dell could help AMD offset some of that weakness.
AMD's computing and graphics revenue surged 74% year-over-year last quarter, and investors can expect its terrific momentum to continue thanks to a couple of new catalysts. First, AMD has now started shipping its Ryzen CPUs for the notebook market. It expects to have a full-fledged Ryzen-based notebook lineup on the market by the first quarter of 2018.
This puts AMD in a strong position to benefit from the laptop market's growth, where shipments are expected to jump more than 8% over the next two years.
Second, AMD's Vega GPUs can get a lift from blockchain applications. Blockchain is a distributed database that holds information across several locations. This makes it difficult for hackers to breach the database as they would have to corrupt millions of computers at a go.
GPUs are expected to play a key role in this technology, as a blockchain system can buy spare computing power from a large number of users to power the platform, instead of buying all the hardware from just one source. This could boost GPU sales as users would want to boost their computing power so they could sell surplus power to the blockchain provider.
The blockchain market is expected to grow at an annual rate of over 61% until 2021. It is expected to hit a size of over $2.3 billion thanks to its growing application in various verticals such as financial services, banking, and retail.
AMD's execution has remained top notch as the improving traction of its new products shows, and this has given a substantial boost to its revenue and earnings. The company doesn't have any shortage of long-term catalysts, so it could keep growing its business in a profitable manner by selling higher-margin products.

            ","Shares of  Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soared in early October, rising as much as 12% in anticipation of the chip designer's third-quarter results. But that report turned out to be a disappointment, and AMD shares tumbled. All told, AMD's stock fell 13.8% last month, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
AMD was destined to make a big move after this earnings report -- win or lose. Analysts raised their price targets ahead of the earnings release, noting strong results across the semiconductor industry and seeing no end to the cryptocurrency mining boom driving AMD's growth. At the same time, short-selling interest in the stock spiked to record levels, indicating a lot of skeptical investors willing to bet real money on AMD shares heading downward.
When the report finally arrived, AMD exceeded analyst targets across the board with adjusted earnings of $0.10 per share on sales of $1.64 billion. But the stock had been priced for absolute perfection, and AMD fell short of delivering on that. The next day, AMD shares closed nearly 14% lower.

Don't cry for AMD shareholders. Even after October's sudden correction, the stock is up a market-stomping 70% over the last 52 weeks. These shares are still set up for some crazy volatility, trading at 34 times forward earnings estimates, and with 19% of the share base borrowed out by short-selling pessimists.
In November, I had to look outside and check for flying pigs or snowballs in Florida, as archrival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced a new Core processor lineup featuring AMD's Radeon graphics technology. If these longtime adversaries are working together now, exactly how close might that partnership grow? Then again, Intel immediately followed up by pilfering AMD's top graphics guru, Raja Koduri, to create graphics solutions for it instead.
Those Floridian snowballs are melting again.

            ","After the market closes on Thursday, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will attempt to wow investors yet again with its quarterly results. The graphics-chip company's performance over the past year has been stellar. Revenue has been growing at a 50% clip, per-share earnings have been doubling, and the stock has more than tripled.
While most of the headlines go to NVIDIA's efforts in artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, the gaming business remains the core of the company. Gaming has been responsible for the bulk of NVIDIA's growth over the past year, and it accounted for a bit more than half of its revenue during the second quarter of 2017. There are some headwinds that will make maintaining that growth rate difficult in the third quarter.
Image source: NVIDIA.
NVIDIA's GeForce 10 series of graphics cards launched toward the end of the company's fiscal second quarter last year. The high-end GTX 1080 came in late May, followed by the GTX 1070 in June, the GTX 1060 in July, and the ultra-high-end Titan X in August. These GPUs are based on NVIDIA's Pascal architecture, which provided major improvements in performance and efficiency compared to its predecessor.
To say that this launch was a success would be an understatement. During the fiscal third quarter of last year, the first full quarter following the launch, NVIDIA's gaming revenue soared to $1.244 billion. That's up 59% compared to the second quarter, and up 63% compared to the third quarter of the previous year. Aiding NVIDIA was the fact that its only competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), had no real presence in the high-end graphics card market at the time.
NVIDIA lapped the initial launch of the 10 series during the third quarter of this year. The company has filled out its lineup with additional products, like the GTX 1050 and the Titan Xp, but the big sellers have been on the market for over a year. Bottom line: The growth rate in the gaming business is bound to slow.

Another wrinkle: AMD now has a stronger presence in the high-end graphics-card market with Vega. AMD launched Vega 56 and Vega 64 in August, and while the cards come with some major trade-offs, NVIDIA no longer has free rein in the most lucrative part of the market. Add these two headwinds up, and you get a potential snag in NVIDIA's gaming growth story.
Despite a dearth of recent product launches and a resurgent AMD, there is one tailwind that will benefit NVIDIA's gaming business in the third quarter. NVIDIA managed to win the contract to supply chips for Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) Switch gaming console, which launched back in March. Nintendo's previous Wii U console was mostly a flop, but the Switch looks like a runaway success so far.
The more Switch consoles that make it into consumers' hands, the more revenue NVIDIA receives for its chips. Nintendo sold 4.89 million Switch consoles during the six-month period ending in September, and it expects cumulative sales to reach 17 million by the end of its fiscal year in March. That's likely hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue for NVIDIA's gaming business.
AMD provides chips for the other two major consoles, the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. That business peaks each year in the third quarter as inventory is built for the end of the year. NVIDIA may get a similar tailwind in its third quarter as Nintendo prepares for what could be a very successful holiday season.

Following the surge in the stock price over the past couple of years, shares of NVIDIA now have some optimistic expectations built in. With a market capitalization of $125 billion, the stock sports some mesmerizing ratios: 15 times trailing-12-month (TTM) sales, 55 times TTM net income, and 64 times TTM free cash flow.
Those ratios can be justified if NVIDIA can keep growing at a breakneck pace. The data center and automotive businesses, which sell chips aimed at accelerating enterprise workloads and powering driver-assistance and self-driving features in automobiles, are still small, and they could be set for many years of growth. The gaming business may be a different story, and a slowdown there could make it difficult for NVIDIA to grow fast enough to satisfy investors.
We'll know Thursday whether NVIDIA's gaming business can keep impressing investors. It will need to overcome increased competition and the lapping of blockbuster results last year. The Nintendo Switch will help the cause, but it may not be enough.

            ","Though there were some similarities in their third-quarter earnings releases, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have taken dramatically different turns since the reports came out.
AMD stock took a turn decidedly for the worse. However, with its shares down 21% since its Q3 release on Oct. 24, it could be argued that it has been oversold, so value seekers may consider it tempting. No such problems for Intel, which reported Thursday: Its stock jumped 10% in the past week.
So, which is the better buy: AMD, with its potential value, or Intel, due to the budding strength of its core businesses?
Image source: Getty Images.
Generally, when a company posts a 26% increase in revenue and  returns to profitability -- both of which AMD did last quarter -- one would expect it to be cause for celebration. Safe to say CEO Lisa Su left her party hat in storage following the earnings release, however.
AMD's $1.64 billion in total revenue obliterated  last year's $1.22 billion. The good and bad news was that AMD's new-ish Ryzen processor helped boost its computing and graphics (CG) unit sales an eye-popping 74% to $819 million. The not-so-good news was that outstanding CG growth was one of AMD's few positives last quarter.
Thanks to its CG results AMD posted a profit of $0.07 per share, up from a $0.50 per share loss in Q3 2016. Skeptics will point to the $340 million hit AMD took last year related to its wafer supply agreement (WSA) as the reason for the disparity. But even setting aside the WSA charge, AMD's bottom line number for Q3 2017 still would have been an improvement.
Another win last quarter, albeit a small one, was the 4 percentage point improvement in AMD's gross margin to 35%, excluding the one-time WSA charge. The reason to consider that a small win is that its gross margin is still well below those if its competitors, as discussed below.
In addition to record growth in Intel's key segments -- data centers, the Internet of Things (IoT), and memory solutions -- CEO Brian Krzanich continues to deliver on his promise to pare overhead. Intel posted a 6% increase in revenue to $16.15 billion and shaved nearly $600 million off operating expenses to $4.9 billion.
The result of Intel's strong top line and leaner operations was a staggering 36% rise in earnings per share (EPS) to $0.94, well above last year's $0.69 a share. The data center group generated $4.9 billion, a 7% improvement; IoT sales soared  23% to $849 million; and sales from non-volatile memory solutions popped 37% to $891 million.
The strength of Intel's core businesses as it continues its transformation away from a PC focus more than made up for the flat year-over-year result for the computing group, which generated $8.9 billion in revenue. Another sign of Intel's progress was its record-setting $5.1 billion in operating income, a whopping 15% improvement.
As for the aforementioned gross margin comparison, Intel's actually declined a percentage point ... to 62.3%, well above the 35% its smaller rival improved to. As competition in data centers, IoT, and artificial intelligence solutions heats up, there's bound to be some pricing pressure, but Intel's margins remain a strong point.
Though I'm not necessarily bullish on AMD, it is likely the negativity surrounding its Q3 results resulted in its stock being oversold -- a bit. Not only are AMD's margins questionable, investors are still waiting to see its revenue growth translate to higher profitability.
Not to mention AMD remains a somewhat niche, gaming-processor-focused provider, which puts it squarely in sights of big hitters like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and even (to a lesser extent) Intel. In the data center market, even with its new Epyc processors, AMD is a barely noticeable also-ran against an Intel that holds a 99% market share. Toss in the growth Intel is achieving in it core units, plus a dividend currently yielding 2.4%, and it is hands-down the better buy.

            ","Monday was a generally positive day for the financial markets, with major benchmarks posting modest gains from last week's record levels. Merger and acquisition activity became the focus of investors' attention today thanks to a major deal in the technology sector, but other contributors to the market's strong performance included a lack of substantial bad news from President Trump's trip to Asia and signs of progress on the federal government's domestic policy agenda. Some stocks benefited strongly from the attitude on Wall Street, and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Cavium (NASDAQ:CAVM), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Shares of Chesapeake Energy climbed 12%, bouncing back from poor performance in the month of October. Many investors have been nervous about the energy giant, citing unhealthy levels of debt that could hamper the company's ability to react to a rising interest rate environment. Yet news over the weekend of a shake-up in the Saudi royal family sent crude oil prices to their highest levels of the year, and a healthier energy market could be just the ticket to help Chesapeake make the most of its opportunities. The oil and natural gas producer still has plenty of work ahead of it, but higher prices would make it a lot easier for the well-known industry player to make progress.

Cavium stock climbed 12% after reports surfaced that the semiconductor chip manufacturer might become the target of an acquisition bid. The Wall Street Journal reported that Cavium could be in talks with Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ:MRVL), with a possible deal to be announced within the next several weeks. The combination would be highly complementary, with Marvell focusing on areas like data centers and wireless and network applications for which Cavium already produces highly integrated semiconductor products. A deal is far from certain, but with M&A activity picking up in the space, the move makes sense for both players.
Finally, shares of Advanced Micro Devices climbed 7%. The maker of graphics processing chips and microprocessors said that it would work with archrival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to create a multichip processor package. Under the deal, AMD will supply a semi-custom Radeon graphics processor unit to go with an Intel Core processor and a specialized memory chip to compete in the high-performance graphics space. A collaboration between Intel and AMD would have once seemed unthinkable, but as NVIDIA takes greater control of the chip market, an aggressive response is warranted, especially given shareholders' concerns about Advanced Micro's ability to sustain recent growth rates.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) recently plunged after the chipmaker's third quarter earnings sparked concerns about its future growth.
On the surface, the numbers looked solid. AMD's revenue rose 25% annually to $1.64 billion and beat estimates by $130 million, marking an acceleration from 18% sales growth in the second quarter and 23% growth in the prior year quarter. It also expects its revenue to rise 20% for the full year, compared to a prior forecast for ""mid-to-high teens"" growth.
On the bottom line, Its non-GAAP net income surged 307% to $110 million, or $0.10 per share, beating expectations by two cents. On a GAAP basis, its net income of $71 million, or $0.07 per share, marked a huge improvement from its loss of $0.50 in the prior year quarter. Its non-GAAP and GAAP margins both rose annually.
Image source: AMD.
Based on those numbers, AMD looks like it's firing on all cylinders. So why were investors so eager to dump the stock, and does the sell-off represent a buying opportunity for long-term investors?
AMD's Computing and Graphics revenue soared 74% annually to $819 million on robust demand for its new Radeon GPUs and Ryzen CPUs.
AMD's newer Vega-based CPUs compete against NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) current-gen Pascal-based GeForce GPUs at comparable prices, and they remain popular with budget PC gamers and cryptocurrency miners. Its new Ryzen x86 CPUs are aimed at Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) current-gen Kaby Lake processors, and benchmarks indicate that they almost match Intel's performance at much lower prices.
Image source: Getty Images.
This means that AMD's Radeon and Ryzen chips are currently good options for budget-minded consumers who want to upgrade their PCs. But AMD introduced these new chips near the tail end of NVIDIA and Intel's current-gen cycles.
NVIDIA's Pascal chips, which were introduced in mid-2016, will be succeeded by its next-gen Volta chipsets early next year. Intel's Kaby Lake, which was launched at the beginning of 2017, was recently succeeded by the Coffee Lake refresh, and will be upgraded from the 14nm to 10nm process with Cannonlake next year.
Simply put, AMD is keeping pace with NVIDIA and Intel now, but that could all change next year as the two market-leading rivals leapfrog AMD's chips again. Intel's latest earnings report indicates that although Ryzen is gaining some market share in PCs, Intel remains firmly in control of both the PC and data center markets and AMD still faces a long uphill battle.
Moreover, AMD's guidance for a 15% sequential decline in companywide sales during the fourth quarter (representing 26% annual growth) was disappointing, since the bulls had expected the triple threat of Vega, Ryzen, and Epyc server chips to generate some strong year-end sales. AMD might have something up its sleeve to deal with Volta and Cannonlake next year, but the chances that it can effectively counter both rivals on a much lower R&D budget seems highly unlikely.
In previous quarters, AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business was a pillar of growth which frequently offset less reliable growth at its Computing and Graphics business. Much of that growth came from robust sales of the PS4 and Xbox One, which use the unit's custom SoCs.
Image source: Getty Images.
However, demand for those aging consoles is waning. NVIDIA also scored a major victory against AMD over the past year by supplying SoCs for Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) popular Switch hybrid console. The bulls expected sales of new Epyc CPUs -- which were squarely aimed at Intel's market-dominating Xeons -- to offset its weakness in consoles.
Unfortunately, AMD's EESC revenues stayed roughly flat year-over-year at $824 million (even after adding a one-time gain from a patent licensing settlement which boosted revenue at both its business units for the quarter), extinguishing the notion that AMD would dent Intel's 99% market share in data centers. By comparison, Intel's data center revenues rose 9% annually to $4.4 billion last quarter on the strength of its new Xeon Scalable processors for AI and other data-intensive workloads.
It's tempting to root for AMD as a disruptive underdog against NVIDIA and Intel, but I think AMD could struggle to counter both rivals' newer chips next year. I might be wrong, and AMD could pull a rabbit out of its hat with updated Vega and Ryzen chips.
It might even pull key customers away from NVIDIA and Intel in the connected cars, data center, and PC markets. But with the stock already up nearly 500% over the past five years and trading at over 40 times next year's earnings, I think there's far too much optimism already baked in.

            ","Wall Street took a downward turn Monday as federal tax reform during this session of Congress began to look more uncertain than ever. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials both fell about 0.4%, and investors struggled with concerns that the long-expected stock market correction could be sparked by any result that was less than a complete victory by the White House and the tax-cut wing of Republicans in Congress.
Adding to the downbeat mood were steep declines in the stocks of a few companies that suffered from bad news specific to them. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP), and Iconix Brand Group (NASDAQ:ICON) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices dropped 11% after the chipmaker drew negative comments from various Wall Street analysts. Morgan Stanley cut its rating on AMD from equal weight to underweight, and cut its price target on the stock from $11 to $8  because of long-term doubts about whether temporary demand drivers like cryptocurrency mining and video game consoles will be able to offset the company's weaker performance in its core markets. Investors were already skeptical about the staying power of its recent surge, but today's move adds some credibility to the assertions, especially given the widespread high expectations among shareholders in AMD.

Shares of Office Depot plunged nearly 20% on worries about its ability to grow in an increasingly competitive environment. The office supply retailer has long had to deal with competition from its archrival Staples, which will arguably have even greater capacity to fight for market share, assuming its plan to go private in the near future comes to fruition.
Now, e-commerce giants appear to be putting more effort into the office segment, which could further hurt Office Depot's prospects. Recognition of that trend led to negative comments from analysts at JPMorgan, who cut their rating on the stock from neutral to underweight, and said they expect less business for the company in the near future. Unless Office Depot can pull a rabbit out of its hat, the company's fundamentals appear increasingly bleak.
Finally, shares of Iconix Brand Group took a more than 60% hit. The brand-management company  said that retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) had decided not to renew its license for the DanskinNow brand beyond January 2019. That will result in loss of about $15.5 million in royalty revenue for Iconix in 2018, which in turn raised the danger that it may violate its debt covenants with lenders. Iconix negotiated amendments to its credit agreements that will reduce the availability of a credit facility, and restructured some of its outstanding debt. Without Wal-Mart's business, Iconix will be under significantly heavier pressure to figure out a more effective strategy for making the most of its brand assets.

            ","Wall Street finished down on Wednesday, and triple-digit losses for the Dow led major benchmarks lower by about half a percent. Earnings season continued to dominate the headlines, but some market participants are more nervous about broader-based macroeconomic calls suggesting that the 8-year-old bull market might finally be starting to run out of steam. Even some companies that posted relatively good earnings results lost ground, as their performance wasn't quite as good as investors had wanted to see. Moreover, some less-than-stellar news also weighed on certain individual stocks. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), and Dr Pepper Snapple Group (NYSE:DPS) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices dropped 13.5% even though the chipmaker reported good financial results in its third-quarter report and pushed its guidance for the rest of the year higher as well. Sales were up by more than a quarter on strength from new product launches and a big acceleration in demand for graphics processing units due to soaring cryptocurrency prices. However, one piece of bad news came from the enterprise segment, where operating income fell by nearly two-fifths from year-ago results. Still, most of those following the stock attributed the share price decline to outsized expectations, and given just how far AMD had soared recently, it's not surprising to see some investors conclude that the stock had gotten ahead of itself.

Alaska Air Group stock lost altitude, falling 13% in the wake of the company's third-quarter financial report. Adjusted net income was up just 2% from year-ago levels, and revenue soared by more than a third thanks largely to the acquisition of Virgin America earlier this year. Yet key metrics fell, including a 4% drop in passenger revenue per available seat mile and a decline in load factors, and the cost of fuel climbed by nearly a seventh from where it was a year ago. With competitors starting to attack some of the routes that Alaska has sought to dominate, shareholders are looking more carefully to see whether Alaska Air's competitive advantages can hold.
Finally, shares of Dr Pepper Snapple Group finished 5% lower. The beverage company posted a 4% rise in sales during the third quarter, but the Texas-based Dr Pepper blamed the recent hurricanes as well as the earthquake near Mexico City for hurting its results during the period. Nevertheless, CEO Larry Young remained confident about Dr Pepper's prospects, pointing to the recent acquisition of Bai and its antioxidant drink line as well as the ongoing brand-building program that the company has implemented. Competition in beverages is fierce, but Dr Pepper has a customer loyalty advantage that it hopes to use to build momentum going forward.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) slumped on Wednesday following the release of the chip company's third-quarter earnings report. AMD managed to beat analyst expectations across the board and raise its full-year revenue guidance, but that wasn't enough to satisfy the inflated expectations built into the stock price. As of 11:56 a.m. EDT, shares of AMD were down 11.6%.
AMD reported third-quarter revenue of $1.64 billion, up 26% year over year and $130 million above the average analyst estimate. Growth was driven by the computing and graphics segment, which produced $819 million of revenue, good for 74% year-over-year growth. AMD has launched a full slate of new products this year, including Ryzen PC CPUs and high-end Vega GPUs, and those products are pushing revenue higher.
Image source: AMD.
Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.10, up from $0.03 in the prior-year period and $0.02 better than analysts were expecting. AMD also managed to produce a GAAP profit of $0.07 per share, up from a loss of $0.50 per share in the year-ago period. AMD benefited from a patent licensing transaction during the quarter, but the details were not disclosed in the company's earnings press release.
AMD sees revenue growing by 26% year over year during the fourth quarter, with full-year revenue expanding by more than 20%. That's up from previous guidance calling for a mid- to high-teens full-year revenue growth rate.
Despite what looks like a great quarter for AMD, the market responded negatively. AMD shares have soared over the past two years, quadrupling in 2016 alone, and the stock was priced for perfection prior to the earnings report. AMD's results and guidance simply weren't enough to justify the stock price.
AMD is competitive in the PC CPU market with Ryzen, and its EPYC server CPUs should lead to at least some market share gains in the coming years. Those tailwinds will be partially offset by declining revenue from game console chips as those consoles enter the later stages of the cycle and the potential for GPU demand from cryptocurrency miners to collapse.
Even after Wednesday's drop, AMD stock trades for nearly 17 times what the company hopes to earn on a non-GAAP basis in 2020. A successful turnaround is still fully priced into the stock, so investors should brace themselves for more declines if AMD fails to live up to expectations.

            ","Despite handily beating analyst estimates and bumping up its full-year guidance in the third-quarter report it delivered after the bell Tuesday, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) sank about 8% at market open on Wednesday.  New products, including Ryzen CPUs and Vega GPUs, drove a double-digit increase in revenue, and AMD returned to profitability. But investors sold off the stock regardless.
What's going on? Expectations were simply too high. Shares of AMD quadrupled in 2016 on the hope that new products would make the company competitive again. Those products did their job during Q3, but not to the degree required to justify the stock's frothy valuation.
Image source: AMD.
AMD produced $1.64 billion of revenue in Q3, up 26% year over year and about $130 million higher than analysts were expecting. Its core computing and graphics segment generated revenue of $819 million, up a whopping 74% year over year. The launches of Ryzen and Vega, along with elevated GPU demand from cryptocurrency miners, drove that impressive increase. The enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment produced roughly flat revenue of $824 million.
AMD CEO Lisa Su asserted during the conference call that Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 chips reached a desktop market share of 40% to 50% at strategic e-tailers worldwide. On the graphics side, AMD saw strong demand from both PC gamers and those using GPUs for cryptocurrency mining. Su predicted that cryptocurrency-related demand will soon level off, although it could also collapse at any time if the mania for unregulated digital money dissipates.
AMD produced GAAP earnings per share of $0.07 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.10. Analysts were expecting non-GAAP EPS of $0.08. The core computing and graphics segment turned profitable, producing $70 million of segment operating income, up from a loss of $66 million in the prior-year period. The enterprise-embedded, and semi-custom segment saw segment operating income decline by 38% year over year to $84 million. Weaker sales of game console chips were a factor in that decline.
AMD forecasts that Q4 revenue will surge 26% year over year. The quarter is seasonally weak for AMD, so this represents a 15% sequential decline. Based on its strong Q3 performance, AMD now foresees full-year revenue growing by more than 20%, up from previous guidance calling for a mid-to-high-teens percentage increase.
AMD's third-quarter was strong, and its guidance was solid as well. But shares of AMD closed on Tuesday, prior to the earnings release, at $14.25, a level that baked in far too much optimism. That price represents a market capitalization of $13.5 billion, nearly three times trailing-twelve-month sales and 19 times AMD's target for 2020 non-GAAP earnings. The company sees non-GAAP earnings rising to $0.75 in 2020, which would represent near-record net income.
Can AMD hit that target? Sure, if Ryzen, Vega, and EPYC produce the kind of growth the company is expecting over the next few years. But the stock was priced prior to earnings as if hitting that target was a sure thing. It's not. AMD faces intense competition from Intel and NVIDIA, and there's a lot that can go wrong.
Sometimes, an overwhelmingly good quarter simply isn't enough. In this case, AMD's frothy stock needed more than what the company could deliver to stay afloat. When a successful turnaround is already priced in and then some, simply executing that turnaround won't be enough to drive the stock higher.
As AMD continues to produce growth over the next few quarters, investors should remember to view its results through the lens of market expectations.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) beat analyst estimates when it last reported quarterly results in July, with that performance driven by its Ryzen CPUs (central processing units), and GPU (graphics processing unit) demand from cryptocurrency miners. AMD will try to provide an encore performance on Tuesday, when it reports its third-quarter results after the market close.
Ryzen and cryptocurrency-related demand will continue to act as tailwinds, and the launch of high-end Vega graphics cards in August will provide another source of growth. The stock has more than doubled over the past year on the expectation that these new products would push revenue and profits through the roof. AMD now needs to deliver.
Image source: AMD.
The average analyst estimate for third-quarter revenue sits at $1.51 billion, a 15.3% increase compared to the third quarter of 2016. That's in line with AMD's own guidance, which calls for a 15% year-over-year increase.
AMD boosted its full-year revenue guidance after its strong second-quarter report. The company expects revenue to grow by a percentage in the mid- to high teens, up from previous guidance calling for a low-teens percentage increase. Analysts expect 18.3% growth.
The average estimate for third-quarter non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share is $0.08, up from $0.03 in the prior-year period. AMD doesn't provide earnings guidance, but a double-digit increase in revenue should drive the bottom line higher. GAAP earnings may also turn positive if AMD matches or beats expectations. That would be a change from the second quarter, when even estimate-beating revenue growth wasn't enough to prevent a small net loss.
For the full year, analysts see non-GAAP EPS of $0.10, with that number rising to $0.33 in 2018. AMD's 2020 target for non-GAAP EPS is $0.75.
The full lineup of AMD's Ryzen PC CPUs has now launched. High-end Ryzen 7 chips came in March, followed by mid-range Ryzen 5 chips in April and low-end Ryzen 3 chips in July. AMD also released Threadripper, a line of ultra-high-end chips, in August.
The selling point of Ryzen is a high core count relative to comparable processors from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The trade-off is that Intel's chips retain a significant advantage when it comes to single-core performance. Intel recently launched its new Coffee Lake line of desktop CPUs, bumping up the core count to six on the high-end i7 and mid-range i5 models. Ryzen's core-count advantage is no longer as strong, but AMD is still more competitive than it's been in years.
Ryzen may not drive massive market-share gains, but given AMD's position in the PC CPU market a year ago, even modest gains will drive revenue higher. The launch of high-end Vega graphics cards in August will also help the cause, although Vega doesn't seem likely to topple NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance. AMD's RX Vega 64 and RX Vega 56 provide similar performance to comparable NVIDIA cards, but they do so by using far more power. The other issue: Those NVIDIA cards have been on the market for over a year. AMD is still playing catch-up.
Demand from cryptocurrency miners, who use graphics cards to perform the compute-intensive work required to extract new coins, may offset Vega's shortcomings. Both AMD and NVIDIA are benefiting from cryptocurrency-related demand, thanks to the explosion in cryptocurrency prices this year. I doubt this demand will last, but it will provide a nice revenue boost for AMD while it does.
Given that AMD was not competitive in either the PC CPU market or the high-end GPU market last year, it should be no surprise that Ryzen and Vega are driving revenue growth. Once AMD laps these launches next year, will this revenue growth continue? Neither product is a clear-cut home run, and neither Intel nor NVIDIA will let market share slip away without a fight.
AMD stock is priced for near-perfection, trading for close to 19 times what the company hopes to earn in 2020. If AMD shows any sign that it's falling short of that target, in its third-quarter report or in the next couple of years, the stock could be in for quite the reversal.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) came into 2017 with momentum on its side, but it lost its way after releasing tepid second-quarter guidance in May. The good news is that AMD has made a terrific comeback since that slip-up, thanks to a blowout performance during the second quarter
Analysts are divided over AMD's upside potential, believing that the stock is fairly valued after rising rapidly over the past year. Therefore, any slip-up from AMD's side when it releases its third-quarter report after the market closes on Oct. 24, could result in turbulence in the stock price once again.
Hence, it is important to check whether AMD's upcoming results can pass muster. But even if they don't, should savvy investors take advantage of any ensuing dip to buy more shares? Let's find out.
Image source: AMD.
Wall Street expects AMD's revenue to increase around 15% year over year to $1.51 billion, which will push its earnings per share to $0.08 from $0.03 in the prior-year period. The chipmaker shouldn't have any difficulty in meeting these targets and it won't be a surprise if the results are even better.
AMD's results could benefit from cryptocurrency-led GPU (graphics processing unit) demand once again. According to Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh, the quarter's GPU shipments were 30% to 50% higher than expected thanks to cryptocurrency mining, paving the way for a strong top-line performance. More importantly, the robust GPU demand has boosted chip pricing by 25% in the past six months, which should augment AMD's margin profile and enhance earnings.
Additionally, AMD has gained more ground over NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU space, adding 1.9 percentage points of market share during the second quarter of the year. Therefore, there is a strong possibility that AMD will come out with flying colors when it reports its third-quarter earnings, though it will also have to issue solid guidance to keep the skeptics at bay.
AMD looks set for a strong finish to the year in light of its recent contract wins. For instance, the much-hyped EPYC data center processor, launched at the end of June, has started gaining traction at cloud service providers. In fact, the company has signed on 10 major server manufacturers that will be using this chip in their data centers.
More importantly, AMD has been scoring wins with NVIDIA's customers, breaking the latter's viselike grip over Amazon's AppStream 2.0 application streaming service. AMD is now providing its server GPU for the Graphics Design instance of AppStream 2.0, while the other two instances are powered by NVIDIA chips.
Even Alibaba has decided to join forces with AMD. The Chinese e-commerce giant will now be using AMD's GPUs to power its cloud service, after originally selecting NVIDIA as a partner in January 2016. AMD's recent inroads into NVIDIA's clientele will definitely give it a shot in the arm going into the end of the year. Investors shouldn't forget that its data center business can get bigger in the long run.
Last year, AMD formed a partnership to license its server-chip designs to a Chinese partner, which gave an immediate boost to its revenue. The Chinese data center market is expected to grow at an annual pace of 13% through 2020, which will drive the need for more server chips. AMD's agreement with its Chinese partner will help it tap the secular growth of this market and boost its revenue in the long run.
Recent benchmarks indicate that AMD's top-of-the-line Vega GPU can outperform NVIDIA's current flagship GPU quite easily. Initially, there were concerns that AMD's new GPU lineup couldn't match up to NVIDIA's chips, but recent real-world tests seem to indicate otherwise.
Tests conducted by ComputerBase.de show that the RX Vega 64 outpaced the NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti in full HD resolution while running the Forza Motorsport 7 game. This is a ringing endorsement for AMD's GPU lineup going into the busy holiday season when GPU sales are traditionally strong.
Given all these tailwinds, it is highly likely that AMD will come out on top with its third-quarter earnings report and guidance, which will help maintain the stock's momentum. But even if AMD disappoints for some reason, investors shouldn't panic -- growth in data centers and gaming will eventually lead to long-term growth.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had been the go-to supplier of custom processors for video game console majors Sony and Microsoft. But NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) rained on AMD's parade when Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) decided to use a custom Tegra processor to power its latest Switch console.
Sales figures suggest that Nintendo has hit a home run with the Switch. The console has outsold both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One four times in the past six months in the U.S. Meanwhile, Switch sales have been very strong in key console markets such as Japan, selling over 1.5 million in just 26 weeks, a figure that the PS4 took 69 weeks to hit.
Not surprisingly, Nintendo now aims to sell 15 million Switch consoles during its first year as compared to the original expectation for 10 million units. Now, NVIDIA reportedly makes $50 on each Switch console, so it stands to win big with this device in the long run given a potential lifetime production forecast of 40 million units.
By comparison, Sony has reportedly sold just over 60 million PS4s in just over three years since launch, which means that the Switch is not a slouch. Therefore, AMD has lost a big opportunity by failing to land a spot in the Switch, especially considering that Nintendo had previously used AMD's chips to power the Wii U console.
But AMD's latest design win in the console space could be a game-changer and help it counter NVIDIA's newly found momentum in the console gaming space.
Atari has decided to make a comeback in console gaming hardware with the Ataribox console, and it has selected  AMD's custom processor and Radeon graphics chip to power the new device. Now, Atari is going all out to make its new console a success as evident from the aggressive price range of $249-$299.

The Ataribox's popularity could soar thanks to its varied abilities and open-source nature. The console will be running a Linux-based operating system, allowing gamers to play games bought on other platforms, according to Atari.
The Ataribox will also double up as a home entertainment device thanks to SD card support, USB and HDMI ports, and Ethernet connectivity, enabling consumers to stream video, music, browse the web, and launch apps. Furthermore, the game publisher has decided to pre-package the Ataribox with a collection of classic and popular Atari games, which could kick-start its sales thanks to the publisher's brand value.
In fact, 900 cartridges of one of Atari's worst-rated games -- E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial -- found buried in New Mexico were auctioned for a jaw-dropping price of $108,000 two years ago. The title was originally launched in 1982, which indicates that enthusiasts are still willing to spend an average of over $1,500 per cartridge of one of its legacy games.
Therefore, Atari's modern take on console gaming could help it make a comeback in this space after years. Furthermore, as Atari is looking to deliver a full-PC experience on the TV to customers, it won't be surprising if it can capture a slice of the PC gaming market as well. This might be possible due to the Ataribox's open-source operating system, and a combination of AMD's processor and GPU (graphics processing unit) that could help it tap both console and PC gaming enthusiasts.
The gaming hardware market was worth  $30 billion last year, and it could grow at an annual pace of 6% through 2019, giving AMD the opportunity to boost its chip sales through Atari gaining a slice of that pie. Furthermore, AMD investors shouldn't forget that the Ataribox can open a new opportunity in the streaming TV device market that's growing at a terrific pace of over  17% a year.
Therefore, the Ataribox's versatility could breathe life into AMD's console business once again after it lost a chance to capitalize on Nintendo's latest device earlier this year.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has made significant inroads into the central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics processing unit (GPU) markets by taking the fight to Intel and NVIDIA. The company is now enjoying substantial market share in both of these areas, which has translated into robust revenue and margin growth.

AMD data by YCharts
Not surprisingly, Wall Street has rewarded AMD handsomely as its shares have soared over 90% in the past year. There's one good reason to believe that AMD can sustain its impressive run -- the success of its products in the fast-growing server market. However, there's a potential hurdle to AMD's near-term success -- the failure of its Vega graphics cards.
Image Source: AMD. 
AMD is currently engaged in a battle for server supremacy against both Intel and NVIDIA. The company claims that its EPYC server CPUs can defeat the best of Intel's offerings in terms of efficiency and performance. It looks like data center customers have bought into AMD's claims, as EPYC launched in late June with backing from several big server players, including leading cloud service providers such as Baidu and Microsoft, which have already announced deployments of the new chips across their data center platforms. Looking ahead, AMD's EPYC chips could find their way into more servers given a strong partner ecosystem that includes Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Dell, Samsung, and others.
Furthermore, AMD seems to have made significant headway into the Chinese data center space by roping in infrastructure providers such as Lenovo and Sugon. Additionally, the likes of JD.com and Tencent have also committed to using AMD's EPYC chips in their data centers. All these partnerships in China could be a big deal for AMD in the long run as the country's data center market is estimated to grow at 13% a year until 2021.
But AMD's gains in this space won't be limited to the EPYC server chips, since its server GPUs seem to be gaining traction as well. AMD recently scored a big win when cloud services leader Amazon Web Services announced that it will use the former's FirePro server GPUs and the multi-user GPU technology in the Graphics Design instance of its AppStream 2.0 service.
This is a big coup for AMD as Amazon has traditionally been a NVIDIA customer. In fact, Amazon uses the Tesla GPUs from NVIDIA to power the two other instances of the AppStream service.
This breakthrough in server GPUs could be a big deal for AMD as the server GPU accelerator market could be worth at least $4.5 billion in 2022, according to Ark Invest. This is almost equal to AMD's revenue in the past 12 months, which means that it can nicely boost its revenue going forward.
AMD's rise has been primarily driven by the company's GPU market-share gains against NVIDIA. At the end of the second quarter, AMD had almost 30% of the GPU market at its disposal, which is a bump over the 21% share it enjoyed at the end of 2015.
AMD has managed to claw back such substantial market share from NVIDIA thanks to its strategy of selling value-for-money GPUs, which allowed it to capture a greater share of the mid- and entry-level market. But AMD might find it hard to replicate this in the premium GPU market, as its recently released Vega chips have been found to be wanting against NVIDIA.
Independent tests indicate that AMD's Vega GPUs can't significantly outperform NVIDIA's rival offerings, which were launched more than a year ago. For instance, the RX Vega 64 and the RX Vega 56 consume more power to deliver an identical performance to NVIDIA's GTX 1080 and GTX 1070. One more problem with the Vega cards is that they don't undercut the NVIDIA offerings on pricing, either, limiting their chances of succeeding in the high-end market.
Furthermore, NVIDIA is reportedly preparing a souped-up version of the GTX 1070 -- the GTX 1070 Ti -- to counter the lower-priced RX Vega 56. Leaked specs suggest that the new card could be as powerful as the GTX 1080 with a base clock speed of 1607 MHz and a boost clock speed of 1683 MHz. It could retail at a compelling price of $430 when it goes on sale at the end of October.
By comparison, the AMD RX Vega 56 has a retail price of $399, but it has a lower clock speed range of 1156 MHz to 1471 MHz. Therefore, performance-oriented enthusiasts are unlikely to have a problem in paying the extra $31 for a more powerful card.
AMD has been successfully lapped up the low-hanging fruit in the GPU market and built up its market share. The company is now looking to accelerate its growth by moving into the lucrative server space, where the likes of Intel and NVIDIA currently hold sway. But investors shouldn't be surprised if AMD stock takes a tumble as its rivals could start coming up with competitively priced products to arrest its rise.

            ","Since the beginning of 2016, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have staged a rally that has left nearly every other stock in the dust. Investors have enjoyed a 360% return in less than two years, brought on by optimism about the company's new products and despite a long stretch of losses.
With AMD's market capitalization near a decade high, can the stock possibly keep moving higher? The good news for investors is that the company's new products are its most competitive in years, and that may be enough to drive more gains. The bad news: The stock price already bakes in so much optimism that there may be nowhere to go but down.
Image source: AMD.
AMD's ongoing turnaround hinges on the company becoming competitive again in its core businesses. In the PC CPU market, AMD had been flailing since the 2011 launch of its Bulldozer microarchitecture, which was a clear-cut disaster. In the GPU market, rival NVIDIA had taken an overwhelming lead, stealing market share and dominating the lucrative high end. And in the server CPU market, AMD's market share disappeared as Intel enjoyed a near-monopoly.
AMD launched the first batch of its Ryzen PC CPU chips earlier this year, reasserting itself in a market that Intel had run away with. The strategy was to provide more cores for less money, and while the products come with trade-offs, Ryzen put Intel on the defensive. The manufacturing gap between the two companies has narrowed, with Ryzen built on a 14nm FinFET process and with Intel delaying its move to 10nm. AMD is a real option again in the PC market.
Vega, AMD's return to the high-end GPU market, has been more mixed. Vega provides similar performance as NVIDIA's high-end offerings, but the cards consume far more power. It's clear that AMD is struggling to catch up with the market leader. Still, Vega puts AMD back into the most profitable part of the graphics card market, and even modest market share gains can provide a boost to the bottom line.
With the server CPU market completely dominated by Intel, the timing of AMD's return couldn't be better. EPYC is AMD's new line of server CPUs, aimed at wresting some market share away from Chipzilla. Like Ryzen, EPYC offers more cores for less money, with a focus on providing a strong value proposition. The EPYC story will play out over the next couple of years, with the best-case scenario being double-digit market-share gains that make AMD a major player in the server chip market once again.
All three product lines will need to exceed expectations for AMD stock to keep roaring higher. The company will need to consistently produce double-digit revenue growth, and the bottom line will need to improve even faster. If AMD truly does return to its former glory, becoming a strong player in all its core markets for the first time in years, investors will likely be happy with the result.
If AMD falls short of expectations in any way, though, watch out below. The company unveiled its long-term outlook back in May, calling for double-digit annual revenue growth through 2020, with non-GAAP EPS expected to reach $0.75 in that year. AMD has posted a GAAP loss in each of the past five years, and it may end up posting a loss this year as well. The company is betting that its new products will push the bottom line back into the black.

AMD Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts.
There are two problems with this outlook. First, non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 represents about $700 million of non-GAAP net income. On a GAAP basis, AMD hasn't produced net income above $500 million since the early 2000s. In other words, AMD's outlook assumes it will hit close to record levels of profitability by 2020.
The second problem is how the market is assigning odds to this best-case scenario. Trading around $13.25 per share, AMD stock is valued at nearly 18 times what the company hopes to earn three years from now. The market is essentially pricing in AMD hitting this guidance. Given AMD's history of overpromising and underdelivering, I wouldn't make that bet.
Nearly everything needs to go right for AMD stock to be an above-average investment from here on out. Possible? Sure. Likely? I doubt it.

            ","Over the last few years, graphics processing pioneer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been riding high on its growing success in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). Scientists found that the parallel processing capabilities that make graphics processing units (GPUs) superb at rendering images in video games also worked well for data processing in AI systems. NVIDIA moved quickly into the space, establishing itself in the majority of data centers running AI applications. Growth from AI has exceeded 174% on average in each of the last five quarters and now accounts for nearly 19% of NVIDIA's revenue. Its stock has surged over 800% in the last three years and has shown no signs of slowing.
Competition may be heating up, however, as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) no longer seems content to cede the space to NVIDIA. Several recent wins of big-name customers show that AMD may represent a bigger threat to NVIDIA than previously believed, and the company may be becoming a serious competitor in the nascent AI market.
Can AMD's new line of AI-enabled GPUs unseat NVIDIA? Image source: AMD.
NVIDIA and AMD have long been competitors in the GPU market. NVIDIA controls just over 70% of the discrete desktop GPU market, while AMD accounts for the remainder. The gaming segment represents the largest share of business for both companies, but the AI market may be an even bigger opportunity going forward.
With the recent release of its Radeon line of GPUs, which were designed specifically to address the high-performance requirements posed by systems running AI applications, AMD is announcing to the world that it wants to be a contender.
E-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that it will use AMD's Radeon Pro GPUs to run graphics software on its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform. Amazon indicated that this new offering would allow users to run the graphics-intensive software, like those used in engineering and graphics design applications, in the cloud. Amazon is the undisputed leader in cloud computing, and this partnership could potentially be a big win for AMD and result in future opportunities.
This follows a recent announcement by China's internet search leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) that it would collaborate with AMD for ""optimizing software for AMD Radeon Instinct GPUs in Baidu datacenters."" Baidu and NVIDIA have a long history together, so this announcement came as something of a surprise. Baidu has one of the most advanced AI programs in China and perhaps in the world, so this partnership gave AMD a shot of credibility in the AI market.
The most intriguing bit of news came recently when CNBC reported that electric car company Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was working with AMD to develop a chip specifically designed for the data-intensive challenges of self-driving cars. Tesla is one of a number of innovators working to perfect autonomous driving systems, and it currently uses NVIDIA GPUs in its Autopilot system. If AMD were to develop a custom chip that was capable of outperforming NVIDIA, this would mark a significant turn of fortunes for the two companies.
It is important to note that the CNBC story cited unnamed sources, and there is some doubt the veracity of the report. Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry called the report ""completely false,"" noting that Tesla and NVIDIA had a five-year contract that had recently been renewed. He also noted the complete lack of benchmarks for AMD running AI systems. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves noted that the report was ""unsubstantiated"" and that even if it were true, NVIDIA would remain ""the de-facto standard and market share leader."" 
The data center market for AI applications is enormous and still in its infancy. A report by MarketsandMarkets estimates that the AI chipsets market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 62.9% over the next five years, totaling $16 billion by 2022.
NVIDIA is the incumbent and as such has its title to defend, while AMD is the scrappy underdog. This isn't a zero-sum game, and just as it has done for years in the gaming market, AMD will likely carve out a niche in the emerging field of AI. NVIDIA shareholders shouldn't lose any sleep at this point, but any high-profile wins should be monitored carefully, as AMD would love to get NVIDIA on the ropes.

            ","The stocks of chip companies Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) have been on the rise over the past year, with the former up roughly 90% and the latter up some 160%. Which of these two archrivals looks like the best buy now? Let's take a look.
VEGA FRONTIER EDITION GPU. IMAGE SOURCE: ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC.
After long being dominated by Intel and NVIDIA, AMD has had a strong start to 2017. AMD received a lot of attention for several new product launches, including its new Ryzen CPUs, Vega GPUs, and its new Epyc chip for servers. These new chips offer a competitive value proposition, and investors are clearly optimistic about AMD's prospects.
In the second quarter, AMD's computing and graphics segment, which comprises sales of Ryzen and Vega chips, had a 51% increase in revenue year over year. For the full year, management expects to finally turn a profit after years of losses. Revenue is expected to be up around 15% or more, with gross margin expanding above last year's 31%.
DATA SOURCE: AMD.  
At a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 130 times analyst estimates for 2017, investors are making a big bet that AMD is going to make a big comeback in the CPU market with its new Ryzen processors. Intel has led this market since around 2006, with its market share reaching over 80%. However, according to Passmark's latest benchmarking data, AMD gained about 10% share versus Intel since the end of 2016, which is a good sign that recent innovations are paying off.
AMD could pick up even more share in the short term in both CPU and GPU markets. Mobile versions of Ryzen will be launching soon. Also, Vega GPUs just started shipping around the beginning of the third quarter, which will give NVIDIA stiffer competition in the short term. The latest data from Jon Peddie Research shows AMD's discrete GPU market share ticked up to 29.4% for the second quarter while NVIDIA's ticked down a few points to 70.6%.
Another opening for AMD could come from the fast-growing data center market, in which NVIDIA has been growing revenue more than 100% in recent quarters. AMD's recent partnership with Baidu shows that there is demand for companies that can provide both CPU and GPU solutions, which puts AMD in a unique position compared to Intel and NVIDIA, since only AMD can claim expertise developing both CPU and GPU technology.

NVIDIA is the pioneer of the GPU. For nearly 20 years, it has been catering to the needs of PC gamers, who make up 57.5% NVIDIA's total revenue over the trailing-12-month period.
DATA SOURCE: NVIDIA. FISCAL YEARS SHOWN. 
NVIDIA launched its latest Pascal GPUs last year, which helped extend its market share lead to as high as 72.5% earlier this year. AMD's new offerings will provide a compelling alternative in the short term, but it's uncertain how much more share AMD can take away, since NVIDIA just announced its latest chip design, Volta, which will take GPU performance to another level. As AMD rolls out Vega chips, NVIDIA will likely announce new gaming GPUs based on Volta in the coming months, which may halt the advance AMD makes on NVIDIA's turf.
NVIDIA doesn't always offer the best value, but it has done a better job than AMD at developing GPUs that deliver high performance while requiring lower amounts of power. This helps neutralize AMD's pricing advantage, because graphics cards with higher wattage requirements may require a gamer to pay for a new power supply in addition to the new graphics card, which adds to the expense of upgrading.
Additionally, NVIDIA has been very successful finding new applications for its core graphics processing technology in other industries, which loosens NVIDIA's dependence on the cyclical nature of the gaming segment. NVIDIA has a roster of partnerships with just about every major automaker to help build a fully autonomous car in the next five years.
NVIDIA's consistent financial performance has allowed it to build a significant advantage over its rival. At the end of the second quarter, AMD had $531 million in net debt, while NVIDIA had $3.9 billion in net cash. In a historically cyclical and fast-changing competitive landscape like computer chips, the importance of having a major cash cushion cannot be emphasized enough.
As for valuation, NVIDIA's forward P/E ratio of about 50 is much more attractive than AMD's 130 times forward earnings. Plus, NVIDIA shareholders get a dividend yield of 0.31%, which is not much, but better than no dividend from cash-strapped AMD.
AMD has upped its game, but for investors looking for the stock with the best risk-to-reward potential, NVIDIA looks like the better choice.

            ","Chipmakers Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) had dramatically diverging fortunes over the past year. Ambarella, which makes image processing chips for a wide range of cameras, shed more than 30% of its market value over the past 12 months. AMD, which sells CPUs and GPUs, rallied over 90%.
Therefore, investors might be wondering if the market is too bearish on Ambarella and too bullish on AMD. Let's take a closer look at both chipmakers to see which stock is the better buy at current prices.
Image source: Ambarella.
Ambarella supplies image processing SoCs to a wide variety of customers, including GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), DJI Innovations, and Hikvision -- which are respectively the largest makers of action cameras, drones, and security cameras in the world.
Ambarella is considered the ""best in breed"" player in that market, but it's being challenged by cheaper chips in China, mobile-based SoCs from Qualcomm, and first-party custom chips from big customers like GoPro.
AMD is the second largest manufacturer of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs in the world. It mainly competes against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market. It also produces embedded SoCs for non-PC devices like gaming consoles.
In the past, AMD struggled to counter Intel and NVIDIA's latest chips. But under CEO Lisa Su, who took over in late 2014, AMD launched new CPUs and GPUs which compared favorably to Intel and NVIDIA's chips again. It also invested more heavily in adjacent markets like data centers and connected cars.
Ambarella's revenue fell 2% to $310 million last year, and analysts anticipate another 5% decline this year. Those declines were attributed to sluggish sales of action cameras, drones, and the decision by DJI to not install Ambarella SoCs in its cheaper Spark drones.
CFO George Laplante also warned of a ""substantial decline"" in GoPro revenues last quarter. That was recently confirmed when GoPro revealed that its latest camera, the Hero 6, would use a custom designed GP1 SoC instead of Ambarella's chip. Meanwhile, sales of Ambarella's SoCs for security cameras continues to face pressure from cheaper Chinese chipmakers.
Image source: AMD.
AMD's revenue rose 7% last year, and analysts expect 18% growth this year. That bullish sentiment can be attributed to AMD's recent introduction of Ryzen, a next-gen CPU that offers performance comparable to that of Intel's higher-end processors at about half the price. Its new Vega GPUs are also expected to help AMD keep pace with NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal GPUs.
AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business should also benefit from the recent refreshes and upgrades for the PS4 and Xbox One, since it supplies custom SoCs for both consoles.
In terms of gross profit margins, Ambarella easily beats AMD because its chips cost much less to manufacture. Ambarella reported a gross margin of 62.6% last quarter, compared to AMD's 33%. However, Ambarella's gross margin declined 410 basis points annually due to the aforementioned competition, while AMD's rose 200 basis points.
Ambarella and AMD both have thin operating margins. But if we compare those results on a quarterly basis, AMD has steadily expanded its gross margins over the past three years, while Ambarella's margins gradually deteriorated.

Source: YCharts
As a result, analysts expect AMD to report a full-year non-GAAP profit this year, compared to net losses over the past two years. Ambarella's non-GAAP earnings are expected to fall 35% this year.
Ambarella trades at 32.1 times earnings, which is higher than the industry average of 25.2 for semiconductor equipment companies. Its P/S ratio of 5.3 is also slightly higher than the industry average of 4.8.
AMD doesn't have a P/E ratio due to its lack of consistent profits, but it trades at 51 times next year's earnings -- which remains higher than the industry average of 24 for semiconductor companies. On a revenue basis, it trades at 2.6 times sales, compared to the industry average of 4.2. This indicates that neither stock can be considered a ""cheap"" play at current prices.
My Foolish colleague Chris Neiger compared Ambarella and AMD about a half year ago, and concluded that AMD had a better business but the stock was tough to recommend after its massive gains.
I have a similar opinion about both stocks -- investors should clearly avoid Ambarella, but remain cautiously optimistic about AMD. I might nibble on AMD shares during a big pullback, but I'm not eager to load up on the stock in this frothy market just yet.

AMD announced a new Radeon graphics processing unit (GPU) today, and investors sent the stock up 5.6%. The processor extends AMD's Polaris architecture to ""embedded"" applications, meaning the chip is intended to go into a wide range of devices that need power and thermal efficiency, rather than into desktop or laptop computers. Examples of target applications are digital casino games, ""thin clients"" (like Chromebooks), medical displays, retail and digital signage, and industrial uses such as airplane cockpits.
""Developers are continuing to push the boundaries on what's possible for embedded systems, demanding more performance, more features and more design options, all while significantly reducing power consumption,"" said Colin Cureton, AMD director of product management. ""At the GPU level, it is critical to provide versatile solutions that do not compromise on graphics performance or 4K multi-display capabilities.""
AMD is locked in a battle with NVIDIA in the GPU arena, a hot growth market. AMD's Polaris architecture helped it gain share in 2016, and boards based on its newer Vega architecture are finding success in gaming and cryptocurrency-mining applications. AMD also won a key placement in Apple's coming iMac Pro. The prospect of AMD's GPUs becoming more competitive in a wider range of applications fueled investor optimism today.
Shares of payroll and human resources services provider Paychex rose 3.6% after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that slightly missed revenue estimates but beat expectations for earnings. Revenue rose 4% to $817 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.62. The consensus analyst estimate was for EPS of $0.60 on revenue of $821 million. 
The company also raised its outlook for the fiscal year. Human resources services revenue for the full year, which comprised 43% of service revenue this quarter, is now projected to grow 12% to 14%, versus a previous estimate of 8% to 10%. Guidance for total revenue growth was hiked from 5% to 6%. The improvement in outlook reflects in part the impact of the company's August acquisition of HR Outsourcing, Inc., a national professional employer organization (PEO).
""We posted solid growth across our major human capital management (""HCM"") product lines in the first quarter, in particular our comprehensive human resource (""HR"") outsourcing solutions and our cloud-based time and attendance products continue to perform well,"" said CEO Martin Mucci in the press release.
Observers often look to Paychex's reports to get an idea of how small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. are doing, since the company's results in part reflect job and wage growth in companies that outsource human resources functions. During the conference call, company management said that small business job growth has ""moderated"" after a burst late last year. But investors seem encouraged about the company's progress, especially its efforts to expand its PEO business.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) have been locked in an intense battle for GPU (graphics processing unit) supremacy. AMD has momentum on its side as its market share has shot up to almost 30% from just 18.8% in 2015, thanks to its focus on selling budget GPUs.
AMD now wants to take itself a notch higher, which is why it is targeting the high-end GPU space with the new Vega GPUs for consumer and professional grade PCs. But this isn't the only front where the chipmaker is looking to engage NVIDIA. AMD's latest contract win indicates that it is now making inroads into the lucrative data center business that's been a big catalyst for NVIDIA so far.

Cloud services leader Amazon has decided to tap AMD's FirePro server GPUs and its multi-user GPU technology to power its Graphics Design instance type. The Graphics Design instance type will allow users of Amazon AppStream 2.0 to run graphics applications in the cloud while reducing the cost of streaming such applications by as much as 50%.
AMD is providing Amazon with four different varieties. The different sizes and scales of the configuration that AMD is offering can be selected by users based on their requirements to run use cases pertaining to gaming, media, design, and engineering, among others. This is, undoubtedly, a big win for AMD as Amazon has usually tapped NVIDIA for its GPU requirements.
For example, the other two instances of the AppStream 2.0 -- Graphics Desktop and Graphics Pro -- are powered by NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs and accelerators. The adoption of NVIDIA's cloud-focused GPUs has boosted the company's data center revenue substantially of late, with revenue from the segment rising 175% year over year in the latest quarter.
But AMD's latest splash in the segment should have NVIDIA worried as this isn't the first time that one of its customers has decided to multi-source its GPUs. Google, for instance, uses NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs on its Compute Engine, but AMD has made inroads over here as well. In November last year, AMD announced that Google will deploy its FirePro server GPUs in 2017 for accelerating the performance of the Google Compute Engine and Google Cloud Machine Learning.
Alibaba is another cloud computing player that has decided to tap AMD's technology for deployment across its data centers globally. This was after Alibaba had signed a strategic pact with NVIDIA in early 2016 to offer GPU as a service.
But AMD's Amazon contract could turn out to be its biggest win as Amazon Web Services currently leads the cloud service provider (CSP) market by some distance. This puts AMD in a strong position to tap the GPU acceleration market, which seems set for solid growth thanks to the rise of tech trends such as the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
These trends will lead to a data explosion in the future, and stand-alone server CPUs won't be powerful enough to perform huge calculations in a short time. This is where the GPU accelerators will come into play as they can compute a lot more data in less time and at a fraction of the cost. AMD, therefore, can expect a big boost to its data center business.
AMD enjoys an advantage over NVIDIA thanks to its recently launched server chip -- EPYC. This new server CPU (central processing unit) has received a good response from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and CSPs; AMD claims that it can outperform rival chips from Intel.
In fact, AMD has already tied up with key cloud players in China such as Tencent and JD.com, as well as infrastructure providers such as Sugon and Lenovo for its EPYC server CPUs. In all, the company claims to have received commitments from 20 companies for the new chip. These partnerships could be a gold mine for AMD as China's data center market is expected to clock an annual growth rate of 13% until 2020.
Therefore, AMD will have the opportunity to cross-sell its FirePro GPUs to its server CPU customers. This could knock the wind out of NVIDIA's data center sales, as AMD looks set to win more market share provided its execution is as strong as it has been in the PC business.

            ","On Monday,  Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) raised eyebrows across the tech world by unveiling its new 8th Gen Intel Core desktop processor family. Perhaps most notably, the central processing unit (CPU) giant lauded its new Intel Core i7 desktop chip as the company's ""best gaming processor ever,"" delivering up to a 25% improvement in frame rates over its predecessor.
Naturally, shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) plunged 5.2% and 4.5%, respectively, as investors worried over the new competitive threat posed by Intel's hefty new gaming chip.
But there's just one problem with that train of thought, particularly for NVIDIA investors: Intel's new high-end gaming CPU poses no threat to the graphics processing units (GPUs) sold by either company.
IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL.
That said, Intel's new 8th Gen Core i7 will compete directly with AMD's latest gaming-centric CPUs. So while it might be an overreaction to a product that has yet to prove itself, it's an understandable response from skittish AMD investors.
But it's hard to see what all the fuss is about for NVIDIA, which focuses solely on GPU technology.
For perspective, note that in a desktop computer, the CPU is often referred to as the machine's ""brain,"" and has fewer cores optimized to handle most processing tasks required by the machine. Meanwhile, GPUs are designed with thousands of cores built to more efficiently handle many tasks at once, making them ideally suited for the computationally intense tasks like handling graphics for gaming. In short, CPUs and discrete GPUs are complementary technologies, and both are required for any desktop machine to deliver a satisfactory gaming experience.
Ironically given NVIDIA's share price decline today, if you scroll down to the bottom of Intel's own 8th Gen Core press release you'll see all but one of its test configuration machines had an NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU installed. The lone holdout was one built to provide a benchmark for a ""5-year-old"" system, and featured an older integrated Intel HD Graphics 2500 chip.
Though Intel's 8th Gen Core i7 isn't a threat to NVIDIA, I can understand why investors might feel nervous about the prospect of a new competitor stemming the growth of NVIDIA's core business. Last quarter, for example, gaming market revenue increased a stellar 52% year over year to $1.186 billion, comprising more than 53% of NVIDIA's total sales. That strength was driven by strong adoption of -- you guessed it -- NVIDIA's GeForce GTX gaming platforms.
At the same time, the market has consistently underestimated NVIDIA's potential since its growth began to accelerate late last year. And as more industries continue to embrace the power of GPU computing, NVIDIA shares have climbed more than 160% over the past year alone (even after Monday's pullback). So, in retrospect, perhaps it should be unsurprising that some investors were quick to take their profits off the table at the first semblance of negative news. Personally, however, I'm content holding my shares and watching NVIDIA continue to extend its market leadership.

            ","The battle for GPU (graphics processing unit) supremacy between Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is getting more intense with each passing quarter. AMD entered 2017 on the front foot after clawing back significant market share from NVIDIA last year.
The latest market share numbers from Jon Peddie Research suggest AMD has managed to sustain the momentum so far this year. It controlled 29.4% of the discrete GPU market at the end of the second quarter. This is slightly lower than the year-ago period's 30.8% market share, but up from the 27.5% commanded by AMD at the end of the first quarter.
Clearly, the momentum is in AMD's favor as it has managed to gain almost 2% in market share from NVIDIA from the preceding quarter. But will AMD keep up the momentum for the remainder of the year, or will NVIDIA make a comeback? Let's take a look.
Image Source: AMD 
AMD launched the first wave of its Vega graphics cards in mid-August. It has priced the Radeon RX Vega 64 at $499 and the Radeon RX Vega 56 at $399, which seems sensible as both will go up against NVIDIA's GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 GPUs, respectively. The RX Vega 64 matches the price of the GTX 1080, while the RX Vega 56 undercuts the GTX 1070 by a good $100.
Therefore, AMD is following its tried-and-tested strategy of giving consumers the same performance at a lower price point. But the success of the new Vega graphics cards is far from guaranteed as they have been found to be lacking against NVIDIA's offerings in certain areas.
For instance, AMD's new GPUs consume more power than their NVIDIA rivals leading to higher heat generation and electricity costs. Furthermore, they don't offer significant performance gains over their NVIDIA peers.
Independent tests conducted by AnandTech suggest that the Vega 56 is just 8% faster than the GTX 1070, while the Vega 64 matches its counterpart. The gains aren't substantial when the power ratings of the competing GPUs are taken into account, though AMD can expect to move units of the two cards to consumers who are solely focused on pricing and performance.
It won't be surprising if the cheaper Vega 56 card sees stronger demand, as it can deliver 90% of its costlier sibling's performance at just 80% of the price. 
But the problem is that the GTX 1070 GPU that AMD is looking to target with the Vega 56 is already more than a year old. NVIDIA has refreshed its GPU lineup over the past year with more powerful GPUs such as the GTX 1080 Ti and the Titan Xp, and they could help swing the momentum in NVIDIA's favor for the remainder of the year.
NVIDIA hasn't gained market share this year despite launching its new GPUs in March and April. This could be attributed to consumers' anticipation that the new Vega GPUs could deliver a superior performance, but this hasn't turned out to be the case.
The new Vega cards can compete with the older NVIDIA cards -- the refreshed GTX 1080 Ti is 35% faster than the GTX 1080 that AMD is targeting. The GTX 1080 Ti is listed for $699 on NVIDIA's website, so it is priced identically to the liquid-cooled RX Vega 64. However, AMD's GPU consumes 30% more power than the GTX 1080 Ti, while it doesn't outperform NVIDIA in terms of performance, either, as per independent tests.
Hence, consumers might start tilting toward NVIDIA's latest GPU since it provides more value for money when running costs are factored in. AMD, therefore, seems to have missed an opportunity, as the hyped Vega GPUs can compete with older NVIDIA cards at best. Furthermore, NVIDIA can extend its technological advantage over AMD with the launch of its next-gen Volta architecture.
Supply chain rumors indicate that NVIDIA could start volume production of the new Volta GPUs by the end of the year, so it could launch the same in early 2018.
In all, NVIDIA could carry impressive momentum into 2018 as performance-oriented consumers will probably start buying its graphics cards. This should increase the company's sales for the remainder of the year since high-end systems account for 43% of the PC market, while a new generation of NVIDIA GPUs next year could help it win back more market share from AMD.

            ","Investors with a preference for tech stocks have a lot of choices these days. Technological revolutions seem to lurk around every corner, and  for every explosive new market or opportunity, there are several companies poised to compete. According to Finviz.com, there are more than 500 stocks in the tech sector today, not counting 250 micro-cap penny stocks.
Amid such a plethora of investment choices, and with such a change-prone industry, it can be harder than usual to distinguish the companies on track to be long-term winners from those more likely to become failing wannabes. As an example, let me walk you through the investing cases for and against embedded chip specialist Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) and graphics-plus-CPU veteran Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Image source: Getty Images.
Both of these companies work in the chip sector, but they rarely compete head-to-head.
Cypress is aiming at three key markets these days. The company designs low-power wireless networking chips for Internet of Things devices, next-generation USB-C controllers for tablets and smartphones, and a variety of embedded solutions for the automotive computing sector. These target markets overlap in some cases. For example, car companies have started to adopt USB-C connectors to enable faster connections between the electronic subsystems of modern vehicles. The world's eight largest automakers have all included Cypress chips in their in-car Wi-Fi and Bluetooth solutions, and that segment now accounts for 31% of Cypress' quarterly revenues overall. That's up from just 12% five years ago.
By contrast, AMD's core market is in central processors and graphics chips for the PC market. The graphics products are sold under the Radeon brand, while processor names include Ryzen, Threadripper, EPYC, Athlon, and the A series of system chips with included graphics functions. The company also makes semi-custom processors for gaming consoles and embedded systems. As it turns out, modern graphics processors are good at the kind of math and data handling that's necessary for mining Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. So crypto-mining has been a growth driver for AMD in recent quarters, and the same functionality also gives AMD's graphics chips a number-crunching place in data centers.
I would say that both Cypress and AMD are striving for results in strong end markets, with plenty of growth potential in the years ahead. However, I would argue that the automotive and USB-C targets hold more promise than the potentially faddish cryptocurrency market. Moreover, the PC sector has been suffering for years now, and AMD faces tremendous competition in every part of the data center market. All in all, the business story behind Cypress just makes more sense.
Winner: Cypress
AMD is not a profitable company. The chip designer has reported negative earnings, cash flows, and EBITDA profits for years. And even though AMD's top-line sales are improving, profits have not followed suit.
Cypress, on the other hand, matches its solid earnings with strongly positive cash flows and EBITDA tallies. In particular, the company is increasing its cash generation these days.
In other words, AMD is still struggling to achieve a turnaround while Cypress can coast on a steady platform of stable cash profits. Moreover, Cypress sports positive profit trends while AMD's bottom-line trend lines are stalling. This one's a no-brainer:
Winner: Cypress
AMD investors enjoyed a strong second half of 2016, followed by a less impressive share-price chart in 2017. That adds up to a 119% gain over the last 52 weeks but just a 17% return year-to-date.
Cypress is running the short-term race on a different track. The stock has gained 27% year-to-date but only 22% over the last full year.
It's hard to complain about massive market gains, but AMD's stock may be due for a correction. The company's valuation is difficult to pin down, thanks to negative results of every kind. Looking at analysts' forecasts for the next fiscal year, you still get a nosebleed valuation of 42 times forward earnings. Cypress investors can breathe much easier as their holdings measure up at just 13 times forward earnings or 23 times trailing earnings.
Market momentum is not a sustainable advantage. I would much rather own Cypress at these prices.
Winner: Cypress
That's a clean sweep as Cypress takes all three rounds. Honestly, it's a stock I might consider owning today, while AMD moved out of that category last summer.

            ","The last several years has been something of a renaissance for graphics processing units (GPUs). Once merely the domain of hardcore gamers, the humble processor has found a home in the growing trend of artificial intelligence (AI). The same number-crunching acumen used to render graphics was found to be equally adept at training AI systems.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) are the two main players in the graphics processing arena, with NVIDIA controlling more than 70% of the discrete desktop GPU market and AMD picking up the remainder. The AI euphoria that has gripped the tech sector has enriched shareholders of both companies. AMD stock is up 113% in the past 12 months, while NVIDIA has skyrocketed 182%!
While both companies stand to benefit from the continuing trend in AI, only one has laid the groundwork to support future gains.
Graphics processing has been minting money, but which player should an investor buy today? Image source: Getty Images.

Data by YCharts
NVIDIA has a leading position in the gaming market and has parlayed that into a significant foothold across the processor landscape. Gaming still accounts for 53% of the company's top line, but it now has massive opportunities in other areas.
NVIDIA saw the writing on the wall five years ago and began repurposing its GPUs for use in AI applications. Not content to rest on its laurels, the company also continued to pour money into research and development searching for additional opportunities, and finding them in such areas as self-driving cars, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency.
NVIDIA already has its GPUs in a dominant share of data centers running AI applications, and has also released the NVIDIA DGX-1 AI Supercomputer, which can be used to fast-track AI applications with integrated AI software built in. 
NVIDIA DRIVE PX is a scalable onboard computer for self-driving cars. The company boasts dozens of partnerships with automakers, tier 1 suppliers, and research institutions working on autonomous driving systems. The DRIVE PX processes information gathered by the various lasers, radar, and machine vision sensors and turns it into information the self-driving system can use.
These investments have paid off handsomely. In its most recent quarter, NVIDIA grew revenue by a whopping 56%, driven by AI-related datacenter gains of 175% over the prior year quarter, which has grown to 19% of the company's total sales.
AMD is the much smaller of the two players, but recent developments have given investors hope that the recent run-up in the stock price won't be fleeting. AMD has created a lot of buzz with its latest line of Vega GPUs targeting both the low- and high-end of the market. It claims that its latest offerings compare favorably with NVIDIA's products in the premium market, but NVIDIA is set to debut its Tesla Volta V100 later this year, so that may be short lived.
AMD can also boast some recent wins, and is making inroads with major players. Chinese search giant Baidu, Inc. recently announced a collaboration with AMD ""on optimizing software for AMD Radeon Instinct GPUs in Baidu datacenters.""
Shortly thereafter, Amazon.com, Inc. revealed that it would use AMD's FirePro S7150x2 Server GPUs and equipped with AMD Multiuser GPU technology to run a new graphics design instance on the cloud. These may be small wins for the company, but they give it a foot in the door that could blossom into greater opportunities in the future.
In its most recent quarter, AMD grew revenue 19% over the prior year quarter, driven by demand in its Computing and Graphics segments. Unfortunately, the company was unable to translate that into profitability, though its loss of $16 million was a vast improvement over the $73 million loss in the prior year quarter. 
While AMD has been making progress against its much more established competitor, it still has a ways to go before it can match the breadth and depth of NVIDIA's reach in the space. NVIDIA is the established leader, and has shown that it has what it takes.

            ","The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and its mass adoption in the tech world has caused a paradigm shift that many companies are feeling -- and NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the greatest beneficiaries of these developments. Researchers quickly learned that the same functionality that graphics processing units (GPUs) offer for rendering images in video games makes them ideal for AI applications. The ability to process vast quantities of data at lightning speeds made GPUs critical to early AI research.
NVIDIA has consistently dominated the market for high-end processors, making it the obvious choice for training AI systems. Search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has one of the most advanced AI programs in China, and has long been a user of NVIDIA GPUs. The companies recently announced a far-reaching AI partnership covering everything from cloud computing to self-driving cars.
That's why it came as something of a surprise when Baidu also announced a collaboration with NVIDIA rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) ""on optimizing software for AMD Radeon Instinct GPUs in Baidu datacenters."" 
The NVIDIA DGX-1, the world's first deep-learning AI supercomputer in a box. Image source: NVIDIA. 
While this is AMD's first serious foray into the AI space, NVIDIA has been aggressively courting the market for years. As a result, NVIDIA's data-center revenue has increased 174% year over year, on average, in each of the past five quarters. With a lack of any serious competition, NVIDIA positioned itself in the majority of large data centers running AI applications.  
Its customers are a veritable Who's Who of companies in the big tech world, and its dominance continues today. NVDIA GPUs provide the foundation for all the top cloud computing services, and it reaped the significant financial rewards that came with its early lead.
AMD has been aiming for a piece of the high-end GPU market with the release of its new Radeon Instinct line of GPUs, which are geared directly toward high-performance computing and a wide range of machine learning and deep learning applications. This collaboration with Baidu gives AMD some much-needed credibility and establishes the company as a viable competitor in the burgeoning space of AI against a much more established rival.
As my colleague Harsh Chauhan pointed out, tests performed on Baidu's open-source DeepBench deep-learning benchmarking tool showed that AMD's Vega GPUs already compare favorably with NVIDIA's Telsa P100 offering. It remains to be seen if that will hold up with the release of NVIDIA's upcoming Tesla Volta V100, which is scheduled to make its debut later this year.
According to a report by Markets and Markets, the AI chipsets market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 62.9% over the next five years, to $16 billion by 2022.
All in all, a collaboration between Baidu and AMD doesn't spell immediate trouble for NVIDIA, and its GPUs will still have a prominent position in Baidu's data centers. NVIDIA has had the field to itself for some time, while others were playing catch-up. Baidu also has a history of partnering with all the top players. With the improvements to its latest high-end GPU's designed specifically for AI applications, AMD just got a foot in the door.
This is definitely a win for AMD, giving it an official debut in the nascent field of AI, which could open the door for more companies to adopt AMD processors. This could, in turn, put pressure on NVIDIA's data-center business, which has been the growth engine behind the company's recent gains. AMD still has a long way to go, however, before it could unseat the reigning champ.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) wowed investors with its second-quarter report in late July, thanks to market share gains in central processing units (CPUs) and strong graphics processing unit (GPU) sales that were driven by cryptocurrency-related demand. The company has done well so far to gain market share in areas dominated by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), powered by a revamped product lineup targeting both high-end and mainstream PCs.
But AMD management believes that the company isn't done yet, as its recently launched products, such as the EPYC server chips, have yet to show their true potential. Additionally, AMD still hasn't launched chips for the notebook PC market, so there is a chance that it might continue gaining more market share.
Now, it won't be surprising if AMD manages to make a deeper dent in its target markets. But this isn't going to be a cakewalk, as both NVIDIA and Intel are stepping up their game to ward off AMD's threat.
Image source: AMD. 
Intel has ceded some of its CPU market share to AMD lately, but Chipzilla has come up with a smart strategy to fight back. The first batch of Intel's recently launched eighth-generation Core chips are aimed at the notebook PC market, while AMD's consumer-grade Ryzen Mobile and commercial-grade mobile Ryzen PRO chips won't hit the market until early next year.
This gives Intel a time advantage over AMD. What could hurt AMD even more is that the new eighth-generation chips will be used in more than 145 laptop and notebook designs from various manufacturers, with the first wave of devices hitting the market in September. This isn't surprising as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) would ideally want to update their devices with the latest hardware before the onset of the holiday season, when sales are traditionally strong.
Additionally, OEMs are also aware of the fact that over 450 million devices in circulation are older than five years. So, they didn't waste much time in committing to Intel's latest generation chip, as it promises twice the performance of those old computers. AMD might have missed an opportunity here by waiting so long before bringing its notebook-centric CPUs to the market.
This could bite AMD in the long run, as notebook PCs are estimated to account for 40.4% of personal computing devices in four years' time, while the share of desktop PCs will shrink to 36%.
AMD has built a lot of hype around its Vega GPUs, promising that they have the potential to take on NVIDIA in the premium end of the market. This could be the icing on the cake for AMD after its aggressively priced Polaris GPUs managed to shake NVIDIA's dominance in the mainstream market.
But it turns out that AMD might not find similar success in the high-end market. AMD's RX Vega 64 GPU, priced at $499, is supposed to compete with NVIDIA's GTX 1080, which is priced the same. Though the performance of the GPUs is almost identical, as pointed out by my Foolish colleague Timothy Green, AMD's card consumes a lot more power when compared to NVIDIA's. Therefore, the RX Vega 64 will be costlier to run.
Of course, AMD is offering a liquid-cooled version of the GPU, but this will increase the price by $200. Moreover, investors should also note that the Vega is being compared to a NVIDIA graphics card that's more than a year old.
The GTX 1080 was launched in May last year, and NVIDIA followed it up with a refreshed GTX 1080 Ti this year that promises a 35% performance boost. The refreshed NVIDIA GPU has a starting price of $699, so it won't be surprising if consumers go for this card in place of the liquid-cooled RX Vega 64 that sells for an identical amount.
What's more, it is rumored that AMD is losing money on each RX Vega 64 GPU sold at its suggested price of $499. The chipmaker is reportedly struggling because of higher component pricing due to availability issues of high bandwidth memory, which makes AMD a risky bet, as Vega's success might not result in any bottom-line gain.
AMD seems to have handed over the initiative to NVIDIA with the Vega launch, while Intel has moved swiftly to capture the notebook PC market. This could hurt AMD's growth in the upcoming quarters.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) plans to make progress in the data center space got a boost recently when the company announced major partnerships in China. The chipmaker's EPYC family of data center CPUs could be deployed by the likes of Tencent and JD.com, in association with data center infrastructure providers Lenovo and Sugon.
This is great news for shareholders, as the company has already racked up an impressive ecosystem of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and cloud service providers (CSPs) for the EPYC family. For instance, the likes of Acer, Dell, Asus, Gigabyte, and others have already committed to AMD for its new chip platform, setting it on its way to tap a market that could be worth $16 billion in 2020, according to the company's internal estimates.
Image Source: AMD 
Chinese players in particular could be crucial to AMD's aspiration of becoming a major player in the industry, which is why its recent deals will play a major role in growing the data center business over the long run.
Research firm TechNavio forecasts that China's data center market will register annual growth of 13% from 2016 to 2020, thanks to the growing demand for public cloud storage. Currently, China's data center infrastructure market is undersupplied -- demand has boomed on the back of data-intensive applications such as the Internet of Things.  
As a result, Chinese data centers need scalable platforms that can provide the necessary density, power, and storage to meet the evolving needs of businesses in the country. Currently, the country's data centers aren't up to par when compared to the global market. This makes it all the more important for cloud service providers to deploy better infrastructure, since China's data traffic will take off remarkably in the next few years, thanks to the addition of 440 million mobile broadband subscriptions.
This is where AMD steps in with its EPYC line of chips, looking to make the most of the huge opportunity that China's data center market could provide.
The chipmaker believes that EPYC is the answer to the problems of cost-effective scalability and performance. In fact, AMD has openly claimed that the EPYC server chips won't be held back by the constraints of Intel's Moore's Law.
Additionally, internal tests performed by AMD claim that EPYC chips can outperform their Intel counterparts quite significantly while lowering operating costs by as much as 30% due to lower power consumption. AMD explains that the performance gains are a result of the smaller form factor and the new architecture, known as Infinity Fabric, of the EPYC chips, which leads to a superior product.
Of course, the reliability of these internal tests can only be confirmed by independent third parties, but it looks like Chinese data center companies have bought into AMD's claims already. At the China EPYC Technology Summit held late last month, AMD listed 20 names (including CSPs, hardware, and software providers) that have committed to the EPYC chips.
This can be considered quite impressive for a new product and should give AMD a lot of confidence in its goal of breaking Intel's monopoly in the x86 server chip market. In fact, Intel currently controls 99% of this market, pulling in revenue of over $17 billion from this business last year.
Therefore, AMD's data center revenue could get a nice boost even if it takes just a small bite from Intel's plate. This is where the EPYC chips and growth in the Chinese market will be essential.

            ","A common mistake new investors make is assuming that a stock's price defines how ""cheap"" or ""expensive"" it is. In reality, a stock that trades at $10 can be expensive, but a stock that trades at $100 might be cheap -- since valuations define a stock's actual value.
Nonetheless, some investors prefer buying stocks with lower price tags, so they can buy them in ""even lots"" of 100 shares that are easier to track. For example, an investor who buys 100 shares of a $20 stock will make $1,000 if the stock hits $30.

So today, I'll examine three tech stocks that trade under $20 and have good growth potential -- HP (NYSE:HPQ), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM).
HP split with its enterprise hardware and software businesses, which became Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, in late 2015. The ""new"" HP retained the company's PC and printing businesses, which most analysts considered slow-growth ones.
Yet HP stock rallied nearly 30% this year, as its PCs gained market share amid a slumping market and its printer sales held steady. Gartner's latest numbers show that global PC shipments fell annually for 11 straight quarters, but HP's shipments rose for five straight quarters -- fueled by robust demand for its higher-end laptops and 2-in-1 devices. HP's printer sales have also risen steadily, thanks to rising demand for its industrial 3D printers and mobile printers. Its acquisition of Samsung's printing unit should further strengthen that business with multi-function copiers.

Wall Street expects HP's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 7% and 3% this year. The stock trades at just 13 times earnings, compared with the industry average of 21 for PC makers. It also pays a forward dividend yield of 2.8%, which is supported by a low payout ratio of 35%.
AMD was once considered an also-ran chipmaker which was respectively losing ground to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in CPUs and GPUs. But the underdog chipmaker mounted a spectacular comeback over the past year.
Strong console sales boosted demand for its embedded systems on a chip, turning its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business into a pillar of growth. It launched new low-end ""VR-ready"" GPUs to challenge NVIDIA, as well as high-end Ryzen CPUs to counter Intel. Those GPUs dramatically lowered the price of virtual-reality rigs, and the Ryzen CPUs offered comparable performance as Intel's high-end chips at much lower prices.
As a result, AMD has posted double-digit annual sales growth for four straight quarters. Its losses narrowed, and it reported non-GAAP profits during two of those quarters. Wall Street expects its revenue and earnings to respectively rise 18% and 171% this year. AMD still faces plenty of challenges, and its forward P/E of 156 looks very pricey -- but the stock could be cheap if lands some more blows against Intel and NVIDIA.
STMicroelectronics is a European chipmaker that produces a wide range of semiconductors for the automotive, industrial, security, and consumer-electronics markets. Its automotive business is its largest unit, and it's been growing rapidly on content-share gains in connected cars. It also manufactures EyeQ computer vision chips for Mobileye, which Intel is acquiring.
STMicro also produces motion sensors for smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches. It supplied motion sensors for iPhones and the Apple Watch and is reportedly supplying 3D imaging sensors for the iPhone 8. All these catalysts enabled STMicro to post double-digit annual sales growth for three straight quarters.
Analysts expect STMicro's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 15% and 183% this year. Those high growth figures support its trailing P/E of 41, which is higher than the industry average of 23 for semiconductor companies. Its forward P/E of 20 looks even cheaper. STMicro pays a forward dividend yield of 1.4%, and its low payout ratio of 57% indicates that it has plenty of room for future increases.
Shares of HP, AMD, and STMicro all trade below $20, but that price is meaningless relative to their valuations. Based on their valuations, HP is the cheapest, STMicro is pricier, and AMD is the priciest.
However, higher valuations also indicate that investors have higher expectations for a stock's growth. STMicro's auto and Apple-related boosts and AMD's comeback could give both stocks bigger gains than HP, which has less room to grow as the world's top PC maker.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) mounted a stunning comeback over the past 18 months, surging from less than $2 a share last February to about $13 today. The chipmaker repeatedly defied the bears -- who claimed that it would be crushed between Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) -- by pivoting toward SoCs for gaming consoles and launching new CPUs and GPUs that addressed previous shortcomings.
However, AMD's rally came to a halt in late July, even after its second quarter revenue and earnings crushed analyst estimates. Part of that decline can be attributed to Barclays' claim that the stock could plummet 30% as the cryptocurrency craze driving its GPU sales dies down and it cedes GPU market share to NVIDIA. Let's examine the bearish arguments against AMD, and see if investors should be concerned.

AMD bulls believe that its new Vega chips will counter NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal chips for several months until NVIDIA's next-gen Volta GPUs arrive. Prior to their recent introduction, industry watchers expected the Vega chips to offer performance comparable to that of high-end Pascal chips at lower prices.
However, AMD's new Radeon RX 64 and 56 desktop GPUs respectively cost $399 and $499, which is merely comparable to NVIDIA's GTX 1070 and 1080 GPUs, which respectively cost $379 and $499. That's why NVIDIA doesn't seem worried about Vega at all. In a recent earnings call, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang declared that the Pascal would be ""unbeatable"" for the ""foreseeable future"".
That's troubling for AMD, which was already overshadowed in the low-end market by NVIDIA over the past year and by cheaper GeForce cards like the GT 1030, GTX 1050, and GTX 1050 Ti -- which cost between $70 to $140. As a result, AMD bulls have started touting the effectiveness of AMD GPUs for cryptocurrency mining -- but as I mentioned in a previous article, some tests indicate that NVIDIA chips can actually perform mining tasks at more power-efficient levels than AMD ones.

This all puts AMD in a tough spot. If the new Radeon Vega chips don't dent Pascal's market share, they could be steamrolled by NVIDIA's Volta chips next year. And if the cryptocurrency craze fades, we could see a big drop in AMD's GPU revenues.
AMD's CPU business fared better with the recent introduction of Ryzen, which offers performance comparable to that of Intel's current-gen 14nm Kaby Lake chips for about half the price. It also captivated industry watchers with its new high-end Eypc server chips.
Unfortunately, it's only a matter of time before Intel strikes back with its final 14nm refresh (Coffee Lake this month) and its first 10nm chip (Cannonlake in early 2018). AMD plans to launch a successor to Ryzen in early 2018 to counter those newer chips, but it's unclear if it can still match Intel's performance at lower prices.
If AMD merely matches Intel's prices with comparable chips, as the Radeon Vega did with NVIDIA's GPUs, it could be marginalized by Intel's superior brand appeal, hardware partnerships, and marketing budget. Meanwhile, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis believes that the Epyc ""is seeing little traction"" in the data center market, which Intel dominates with a 99% market share.
The initial demand for AMD's Ryzen has been encouraging, but investors should realize that growth could abruptly stop if Intel brings out the big guns.
AMD's sales of custom SoCs for Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One turned its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit into a pillar of growth for the company. The recently refreshed and upgraded versions of those consoles will also sport AMD chips.
However, investors should note that Nintendo's hot new hybrid console, the Switch, actually uses Nvidia's Tegra SoC. If the Switch's success prompts Sony and Microsoft to launch similar hybrid consoles, AMD's future in the console market is hardly guaranteed.

Moreover, the Switch bears similarities to NVIDIA's own Shield gaming tablet, which can stream games from higher-end PCs. This indicates that if locally or cloud-streamed games eventually replace console-based ones, NVIDIA's Tegra chips could adequately play games powered remotely by higher-powered desktop GPUs.
AMD's growth isn't a ""sure thing"", but it probably won't crash back to the single digits. CEO Lisa Su made remarkable progress turning around the chipmaker, so I assume she still has strategies to counter NVIDIA and Intel's next-gen chips. Therefore, I wouldn't bet against AMD, but I'd think long and hard about these potential challenges before buying the stock.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) long-awaited reentry into the high-end gaming graphics card market has finally arrived. The company launched mainstream Polaris graphics cards last year, aggressively going after the $200-and-under portion of the market but eschewing the highend. That helped AMD win some market share back from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), but it wasn't enough to turn its core computing and graphics segment profitable.
With the launch of its Radeon RX Vega cards, AMD can finally challenge NVIDIA in the most lucrative portion of the market. The RX Vega 64, priced at $499 and available today, will take on NVIDIA's GTX 1080. The RX Vega 56, priced at $399 and available on Aug. 28, will go toe-to-toe with the GTX 1070.
The Radeon RX Vega 64. Image source: AMD.
Unfortunately for AMD, reviews of these cards suggest that the company is still playing catch up. Review site Anandtech, after running both cards through their paces, concluded that the RX Vega 64 and the GTX 1080 provide similar performance at 4K resolutions, and that the RX Vega 56 provides an average 8% advantage over the GTX 1070. That doesn't sound so bad on the surface, but there are two problems.
First, AMD's new cards are power-hungry monsters. According to Anandtech, the RX Vega 64 consumes between 110W and 150W more power than the GTX 1080 to achieve the same level of performance. For PC gamers who care only about performance, this is a non-issue. But more power means more heat and higher electricity costs. AMD does offer a liquid-cooled version of the RX Vega 64 for $699, featuring higher clock speeds, but this only solves half the problem and adds $200 to the cost.
The RX Vega 56 fares a little better, consuming between 45W and 75W more power than the GTX 1070. For gamers looking for a $399 graphics card that offers the best performance, the RX Vega 56 is it. But if power efficiency is a factor, the choice becomes less clear.
The second problem is that NVIDIA's GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 have been on the market for a long time. The GTX 1080 launched in May 2016, and the GTX 1070 launched in June 2016.  More than a year later, AMD's Vega cards match the GTX 1080 and only slightly beat the GTX 1070 in terms of performance, but require far more power to do so.
Vega's launch has similarities to AMD's last attempt to break back into the high-end market. The 2015 launch of the Radeon Fury line of graphics cards failed to shake up the market because they only matched the performance of NVIDIA's long-available comparable offerings. Fury wasn't disruptive, and neither is Vega. You don't win heaps of market share by fighting last year's battle today.
Given AMD's lack of presence in the high-end market, Vega will certainly win the company at least some market share. But it doesn't look like anything close to a home run, which is what AMD needed. Another problem: NVIDIA will be launching its next-generation Volta gaming graphics cards relatively soon, likely sometime early next year. Those cards will almost certainly trounce Vega in terms of performance.
Like the Radeon Fury two years ago, Vega simply isn't good enough.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have rocketed to 10-year highs after the company reported stellar second-quarter results that comfortably trumped Wall Street estimates. Not surprisingly, the chipmaker soared on the stock market after reporting results, but panic soon set in after certain analysts expressed concerns regarding future growth.
BMO Capital, for instance, downgraded AMD stock from outperform to market perform, while the likes of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse believe that the stock is fairly valued given its remarkable run over the past year. But investors shouldn't get disheartened by the bearish arguments as AMD has got enough catalysts in the bag to propel its multi-year growth trajectory.

AMD has been giving Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) sleepless nights as its Ryzen central processing unit (CPU) chips are eating into the latter's market share. But AMD isn't done yet as the company is still to launch its complete Ryzen CPU line-up. The chipmaker has so far completed the launch of the Ryzen desktop processors, with the latest Ryzen 3 CPUs going on sale late last month.
The Ryzen 3 product lineup will target the budget PC segment with a starting price of $109 -- which is much cheaper than Intel's competing products -- and could help AMD win more market share. But AMD's CPU lineup isn't complete yet as the company is still to bring out CPUs for laptops and notebooks, which are set to be launched in the first half of 2018. This could further boost AMD's performance as mobile notebook demand is expected to exceed that of desktops.
Additionally, AMD is also targeting Intel in the high-end processor market with the launch of its latest Threadripper CPUs. The specs of the Threadripper exceed that of Intel's current line-up at competitive prices. For instance, AMD's TR 1900X CPU with 8 cores and 16 threads is $50 cheaper than Intel's Core i7-7820X. Therefore, AMD can continue gaining more CPU market share thanks to its strategy of providing cheap products that either match or surpass the performance of rivals.
AMD will start selling its Vega line of GPUs (graphics processing units) this month, targeting the high-end PC gaming market with its value-for-money offerings. The company has priced the cheapest Vega GPU variant at $399 and hopes to use it to gain access to gamers who prefer playing games at 60 frames per second.
AMD's survey indicates that there are 600,000 gamers who play games using this frame rate, but there is a huge untapped market for another 4 million gamers who aspire for the same experience but at a budget. The chipmaker has made a smart move by targeting this segment as sales of GPUs priced more than $350 exceed a million units each quarter.
As it turns out, AMD has already made gains in the GPU space this year, thanks mainly to its dominance in the budget segment. Now, the company's ploy of offering budget solutions as compared to NVIDIA in the high-end space could tilt the balance further in its favor.
AMD once controlled  26% of the server chip market but has lost tremendous ground to Intel and its market share has dropped to zero. But the chipmaker has trained its sights on this market once again, with its EPYC server chip that was launched in June this year.
AMD has unveiled a wide range of server chips that will cater to different server workloads, and the company is quite confident that they will be able to beat the performance of Intel's Xeon server chips. As it turns out, AMD's internal benchmarks have already established the superiority of the EPYC platform over Intel, though investors should wait for third-party reviews for an unbiased understanding.
Intel, however, is a big fish in the data center space with revenue of over $17 billion last year, and it wants to get bigger, as evidenced by its ""data center first"" strategy. AMD, therefore, will find it difficult to shake Chipzilla's dominance until, and unless, its server chips can perform better in real-world applications.
But investors should note that AMD needs to carve out just a small slice of the $20 billion server chip market pie in order to substantially boost revenue. For instance, a 5% share the market could add $1 billion to AMD's annual revenue, which is substantial considering that the company has generated  $4.6 billion in revenue over the past twelve months.
AMD hasn't played all of its cards yet. Some of its products have hit the market just recently while more are set to come, so investors can expect a stronger top line performance in subsequent quarters that could extend the company's momentum.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fired yet another salvo last month in its battle for market share with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the central processing unit (CPU) market. The graphics chip specialist has been expanding its presence in this space, first by launching its Ryzen line of desktop CPUs aimed at the consumer market and then following that up with its EPYC family of server processors.
The company has now trained its sights on the enterprise CPU market with its Ryzen PRO CPU line-up that was revealed in late June and offers significant improvements over previous generation offerings. But will this newest release help AMD gain more ground against Intel? Let's find out.
Image Source: AMD. 
AMD Ryzen PRO CPUs are aimed at satisfying the needs of professional workstation users by giving them more computing power. In fact, the company claims that the new CPUs can perform 52% faster than the older generation chips.
What's more, internal company tests also indicate that the Ryzen PRO 1700 is 62% faster than the competing Intel i7-7700 chip in multi-threaded performance. Additionally, the chipmaker claims that its Ryzen 5 PRO 1500 CPU can easily beat Intel's Core i5-7500 chip in various benchmarks including 3D rendering and video creation.
This indicates that AMD will try to replicate its tested strategy of marketing the performance gains delivered by its chips over Intel with the PRO line-up.
That same strategy has worked wonders so far as the Ryzen consumer offerings have helped AMD eat into Intel's market share by a significant margin -- as much as 10 pecentage points -- thanks to their strong performance at competitive prices. Therefore, AMD can be expected to price its new Ryzen PRO CPUs competitively when compared to Intel, which could set the stage for more market share gains once the new product hits the market later this year.
The Ryzen PRO CPUs should help AMD curry favor with professionals engaged in digital content creation, 3D designing, and other compute-intensive applications, setting the company up to tap into a high-margin segment. As it turns out, the mainstream client computing segment that AMD was tapping before the Ryzen launch accounted for 45% of unit shipments but only 21% of revenue.
The PRO line-up shifts the target market, so it is now geared more toward the premium segment that accounts for 55% of CPU unit shipments but a massive 79% of sales. If AMD can gain traction in the high-end workstation market after the launch of its new products, margins should continue to get better.
More importantly, the workstation market is growing at a terrific pace. Jon Peddie Research points out that this segment expanded 22.5% year over year during the first quarter of 2017, and that pace is likely to hold over the next few years due to the rising demand for mobile workstations. The IDC also reported that as demand for mobile workstations exceeds their desktop counterparts, they also carry a higher average selling price. AMD does not want to miss out on this opportunity, so its mobile Ryzen PRO chips should come out in the first half of 2018.
With these dynamics in play, AMD forecasts that its gross margin could jump from approximately 31% in 2016 to more than 40% in 2020, as it continues to move into high-growth, profitable markets. However, all of this depends on the company's ability to win over customers and poach market share from Intel. The company has demonstrated that it can fight the industry Goliath in its stronghold so far, and it can maintain its progress by launching powerful chips at affordable prices.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have climbed more than 31% so far in 2017, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after the company reported strong fourth-quarter 2016 and full-year 2016 earnings, as well as an earnings beat in the second quarter of 2017.
AMD's stock jumped 20% in February after the company reported a 15% year-over-year revenue increase in the fourth quarter, to $1.11 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at negative $0.01, which matched analysts' consensus estimates.

The company also posted solid gains for the full year, with revenue climbing 7% year over year from 2015 and net losses slowing to $117 million, down from $419 million the previous year. 
Nearly all of those gains were lost in May, though, after AMD reported its first-quarter 2017 results. Revenue was up 18% year over year and the company had a net loss of $0.04 per share. But investors were disappointed with the company's Q2 guidance of 12% year-over-year revenue growth. They may have been expecting higher growth after a slew of new AMD products had recently hit the market.
But that didn't stop the company's share price from bouncing back in July -- and jumping more than 20% -- leading up to the company's second-quarter results on July 25. Revenue was up 19% year over year to $1.22 billion and non-GAAP EPS hit $0.02. Both of those results were higher than analysts' consensus estimates of $1.16 billion in revenue and breakeven for earnings.
Investors are likely to be pleased with AMD in the short term, as third-quarter revenue is expected to increase 15% year over year, at the midpoint. The company also increased its annual revenue expectations to growth by mid to high teens percentage, up from its previous expectations of low double-digit growth. That helped fuel investor optimism toward the end of this month and will likely keep it going in the coming months.

            ","With the launch of its Ryzen CPUs earlier this year, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is now sufficiently competitive with Intel to steal market share from the lumbering giant. Ryzen drove a 51% year-over-year revenue increase in AMD's core computing and graphics segment during the second quarter, enough to turn a small segment operating profit.
Low-end Ryzen 3 chips and ultra-high-end Threadripper chips are launching soon, and laptops powered by Ryzen aren't yet available. As the Ryzen lineup continues to be filled out, more market share gains are likely, especially with Intel having execution problems. The launch of Vega gaming graphics cards later this year and the ramp of EPYC server chips should boost revenue further, although winning share in the server chip market will likely be a slow process.
AMD's second-quarter report showed clear signs of progress, although AMD will need both Vega and EPYC to be successful to truly turn itself around. Here's what investors need to know about AMD's second-quarter report.
Image source: AMD.
AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $1.22 billion, up 18.4% year over year and about $60 million higher than the average analyst estimate. The computing and graphics segment was responsible for this growth, generating $659 million of revenue. The enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment, which at the moment is mostly comprised of chips that go into the game consoles, saw revenue slump 5% year over year.
GPU demand from cryptocurrency miners also contributed to AMD's growth. According to CEO Dr. Lisa Su, the company's forecast didn't include this demand in its forecast, and it doesn't expect it to be a long-term growth driver. AMD's GPUs were selling out last month due to cryptocurrency miners snapping them up, but as I've argued, this demand is unlikely to persist.
AMD sees double-digit growth continuing, calling for 15% year-over-year revenue growth during the third quarter and mid-to-high teens percentage growth during 2017. That full-year outlook is a boost from previous guidance calling for low double-digit percentage growth.
Turning to the bottom line, AMD was unable to turn a GAAP profit during the second quarter despite the launch of Ryzen. The company posted a net loss of $16 million, or $0.02 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, AMD squeezed out a $0.02 per-share profit, up from a $0.05 per-share loss during the prior-year period.
AMD expects to produce a non-GAAP profit for the full year, with a non-GAAP gross margin of 34%. AMD's long-term targets call for non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.75 in 2020, with gross margin of 40%. Ryzen, Vega, and EPYC will all need to be successful for AMD to reach those goals.
With AMD stock trading for around $15 following the second-quarter report, the market is extremely optimistic that the company's turnaround has legs. The stock trades for 20 times what AMD hopes to earn in 2020, and more than 200 times what analysts expect the company to earn this year.
Further revenue growth is almost guaranteed, given that AMD is now or will soon be competitive in all of its core markets, compared to not being competitive at all during the past few years. Even modest share gains from Intel in the PC and server CPU markets, and from NVIDIA in the GPU market, can drive double-digit growth.
But AMD will need to exceed its long-term outlook for the current stock price to make any sense. That could certainly happen, but neither Intel nor NVIDIA are going to let AMD steal share without putting up a fight. If you bet on an AMD turnaround two years ago, when the stock was in the doldrums, that bet has paid off big time. If you're betting on it now, with the company valued as if its turnaround has already succeeded, the odds don't look so good.

As for individual stocks, AT&T (NYSE:T) rose on unexpectedly high profits and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped on strong sales of premium chips.

Telecom giant AT&T pleased investors with second-quarter profits that exceeded expectations, and the stock jumped 5%. Revenue totaled $39.8 billion, a 1.7% drop from a year earlier, but in line with analyst estimates. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.79, an increase of 9.7% and $0.06 more than what Wall Street was looking for. 
Although revenue has been challenged by declining wireline services, fewer wireless phone upgrades, and unlimited data plans, the company achieved better profitability through cost-cutting efforts, improving its operating margin 1.5 percentage points compared with last year (disregarding one-time events and amortization). Despite stiff competition, AT&T added 2.8 million wireless subscribers and achieved its best-ever postpaid phone churn of 0.79%.
In the press release, CEO Randall Stephenson said: ""[I]n a quarter where our competitors used promotions aggressively, we added more than 500,000 branded smartphones to our base and more than 100,000 IP broadband subscribers, achieved record EBITDA wireless margins and had the lowest postpaid phone churn in our history.""
AT&T's 2015 acquisition of DIRECTV appears to be paying off, despite the cord-cutting trend. Traditional video subscribers fell, but the company is having success selling its over-the-top video offering, DIRECTV NOW, and getting more value out of customer accounts by bundling wireless, internet, and DIRECTV. 
Still ahead for AT&T is the megamerger with Time Warner -- on track for completion by the end of the year, according to management -- but investors seem to be warming up to the changes this Dividend Aristocrat has made already.
AMD reported better-than-expected quarterly results on the strength of its high-powered graphics processors and a new family of chips for desktop computers. Revenue was $1.22 billion, up 18% from last year and better than the $1.16 billion that analysts were expecting. The company earned $0.02 per share compared with a loss of $0.05 last year, with analysts expecting a breakeven quarter. The stock rose as much as 10.9% on the news, ultimately settling to a 4.6% gain.
The computing and graphics segment grew revenue 51% to $659 million, thanks to the first full quarter of shipments of the Ryzen family of CPUs and higher volumes and prices for its Radeon graphics chips, which are seeing strong demand driven by gaming and cryptocurrency mining. Gross margin was up 2 percentage points over last year due to a higher mix of premium chips in high-performance applications.
""Our Ryzen desktop processors, Vega GPUs, and EPYC datacenter products have received tremendous industry recognition,"" said CEO Dr. Lisa Su in the press release. ""We are very pleased with our improved financial performance, including double digit revenue growth and year-over-year gross margin expansion on the strength of our new products.""
Today's investor reaction stands in stark contrast to what followed AMD's first-quarter report, when the stock tumbled 24% in a single day. The results this quarter seem to indicate that the company is taking share in desktop processors from rival Intel at the same time it is successfully going toe-to-toe with NVDIA in the lucrative market for high-end graphics processors.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped on Wednesday following the Tuesday evening release of the company's second-quarter report. AMD beat analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings, driven by strong sales of its Ryzen CPUs and demand for its GPUs from cryptocurrency miners. As of 11:29 a.m. EDT, the stock was up about 8.6%.
AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $1.22 billion, up 18.4% year over year and about $60 million higher than the average analyst estimate. The computing and graphics segment produced $659 million of revenue, up 51% year over year. Both high-end and mainstream Ryzen CPUs were available during the quarter, and AMD's Polaris GPUs proved popular for those mining cryptocurrencies.

AMD posted a GAAP net loss of $16 million, or $0.02 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, the company managed a $0.02-per-share profit, up from a $0.05-per-share loss during the prior-year period and $0.02 better than analysts were expecting. The computing and graphics segment turned a small $7 million operating profit, enough to offset a decline in profitability in the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment.
Looking forward, AMD expects to produce 15% year-over-year revenue growth during the third quarter, and mid- to high-double-digit revenue growth for the full year. The company also expects to produce a non-GAAP net profit this year.
Part of the reason AMD beat estimates was due to GPU demand from cryptocurrency miners. According to CEO Dr. Lisa Su, the company didn't factor this demand into its forecasts, and it doesn't expect it to be a long-term growth driver.
Still, it's clear that Ryzen is winning some market share for AMD. That wasn't enough for the company to turn a GAAP profit, but only a portion of the Ryzen lineup was available during the quarter. Laptops featuring Ryzen have yet to launch, and low-end Ryzen 3 chips are not yet available.
Gaming variants of AMD's Vega GPU are expected to launch later this year, and its EPYC server chips will be ramping up as the company aims to steal share away from Intel. All three products need to be successful for AMD's current stock price -- around 20 times what the company aims to earn in 2020 -- to make any sense.

            ","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...
By all rights, owners of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock should be celebrating today. On Tuesday after close of trading, AMD reported an 19% increase in revenue featuring a 51% surge in revenue from its computing and graphics division. Headlines are calling the quarter not just an ""earnings beat"" but a ""blowout,"" and one in which AMD ""gave investors what they wanted,"" up to and including ""upbeat guidance"" on top of strong actual results. AMD stock is surging better than 9% in response to the news.
And then BMO Capital downgraded it.
Here's what you need to know.
AMD stock is on fire -- but one analyst wants to put it out. Image source: Getty Images.
AMD reported its fiscal Q2 2017 revenue came in at $1.22 billion, which was ahead of estimates. Earnings were either negative $0.02 (GAAP) or positive $0.02 (pro forma), depending on whether you like your earnings news in the form sanctioned by generally accepted accounting principles or management's EBBS (earnings before bad stuff) format.
Analysts, who go the pro forma route, predicted AMD would only break even in Q2 -- so by that standard, the $0.02 in pro forma profits constituted an earnings beat.
Left and right across Wall Street, most analysts responded positively to AMD's results this morning, with Stifel Nicolaus raising its price target on AMD stock to $13, Mizuho Securities going to $17, and Merrill Lynch to $18. But up at BMO Capital in Canada, they're humming a more cautious tune.
As explained this morning on StreetInsider.com (requires subscription), BMO called AMD's performance in Q2 ""near-flawless."" BMO fully expects AMD's new Ryzen and Vega chips to take away market share from rivals like NVIDIA and Intel. Regardless, BMO said it foresaw no ""meaningful ensuing earnings"" for AMD.
Accordingly, BMO has downgraded AMD stock to market perform and assigned a price target of just $15 to the stock.
And yet, to listen to AMD management, things are going great. ""[S]econd quarter results demonstrate strong growth driven by leadership products and focused execution,"" said AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su. Across the company's product lines, ""Ryzen desktop processors, Vega GPUs, and EPYC datacenter products"" are all getting ""tremendous industry recognition,"" driving ""improved financial performance, including double digit revenue growth and year-over-year gross margin expansion.""
Peering into the future, AMD said revenue should grow ""approximately 23 percent sequentially, plus or minus 3 percent"" in Q3, and ""approximately 15 percent year-over-year."" This seems to suggest that AMD is looking to book revenue of as much as $1.5 billion this current quarter -- whereas Wall Street is looking for less than $1.4 billion -- making another earnings beat a real possibility. Revenue for the full year should grow by ""a mid to high-teens percentage,"" which is better than the ""low double digit percentage"" AMD was previously forecasting.
And yet, while all this sounds good from a revenue standpoint, it's notable that Su chose to focus exclusively on forecasting revenue growth for AMD going forward -- and said not a word about profits. That tends to support BMO's view that actual ""earnings"" on said revenue may not be ""ensuing"" at all.
So where does this leave investors?
Judging from the latest tally of AMD's earnings and free cash flow posted by S&P Global Market Intelligence, AMD is still losing money hand over fist. Over the past 12 months, AMD has now racked up GAAP losses of $546 million, and remains on track to record its sixth straight year of losing money. The free cash flow picture is prettier, but only relatively so. Cash burn for the past 12 months is negative $129 million, reversing the trend toward positive free cash flow that we thought might be beginning last year.
Granted, analysts on the whole remain optimistic about AMD's chances of turning profitable -- but not before 2018, and even then, with GAAP profits of only $0.19. Given that AMD stock now trades at a multiple of 81 times those hypothetical next year's earnings, I have to agree that BMO's caution is warranted. At today's prices, AMD stock is simply too expensive to buy.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have made a recovery after getting clobbered after the company's first-quarter report at the beginning of May, working their way back to slightly above where they were before that quarterly report was released. Potential market share gains against Intel and NVIDIA  have improved investor confidence.
However, AMD's momentum will be put to the test when the company releases its fiscal second-quarter results on July  25, as investors will be looking for stronger second-half guidance. But will AMD deliver, or should investors prepare themselves for some surprises? Let's find out.
Image Source: AMD https://www.facebook.com/AMDIndia/photos/a.616163705118068.1073741827.602353899832382/1164525556948544/?type=1&theater
Analysts expect AMD's second-quarter revenue  to climb 12.5% year-over-year to $1.16 billion, which is in line with the company's own expectations. The GPU specialist hasn't given a bottom-line estimate, though analysts expect  it to achieve break-even as compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in the year-ago quarter.
If AMD has indeed gained market share the way market watchers say, it is quite likely that AMD will be able to at least meet these estimates. A recent estimate by PassMark put AMD's market share in the CPU space at 23.4%. By comparison, the company's share was relatively lower at 17.5% in the year-ago period. If that estimate is true, it means the newly launched Ryzen CPUs are making a dent in this market.
Meanwhile, GPU rival NVIDIA is feeling the heat from AMD and is estimated to have lost 4.2 percentage points of GPU market share during the first quarter of the year, and AMD hasn't even launched its Vega GPUs yet. 
AMD has been able to rapidly reduce its losses in recent quarters. The company's non-GAAP (adjusted) operating loss dropped  to just $6 million during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to a loss of $55 million in the year-ago period. The lower net loss was driven by 2-percentage-point growth in the gross margin to 34%, setting AMD on the way to hitting the break-even point given the projected revenue growth.
AMD is capable of providing an impressive third-quarter outlook as more of its products have hit the market in recent months. For instance, AMD recently launched  its Ryzen PRO CPUs for the commercial desktop market, while it is set to release Ryzen mobile chips by the end of the year.
Additionally, the company is now targeting the mid-tier CPU market with the Ryzen 3 chips, which are expected to go on sale toward the end of July. The good news for AMD investors is that it is going after Intel in this market segment as well by pricing  the Ryzen chips aggressively. Once AMD is out with its complete product lineup, it should be able to capture a bigger share of the CPU market.
Meanwhile, AMD can gain more ground in GPUs once it launches its Vega graphics cards. In fact, the company has already landed a major client in the form of Apple, which will be using  the Radeon Pro Vega GPU in the iMac Pro to power virtual reality applications.
Furthermore, AMD is likely to come out with its new  GPUs later this month, just in time for the seasonally strong back end of the year. AMD has all the ingredients to deliver a robust outlook this time around.

            ","Fresh off the reveal of its EPYC server processors, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will be under the microscope on July 25 when it reports its second-quarter results. It will take time for EPYC to gain traction, so investors probably won't have a good sense of its success until sometime next year. The main driver of AMD's second-quarter will be Ryzen, the company's PC CPUs that began trickling out in March.
AMD's second-quarter revenue will feature a full quarter of high-end Ryzen 7 sales and nearly a full quarter of mainstream Ryzen 5 sales. AMD is gaining some market share with its new chips, although it's unclear exactly how much. While Ryzen makes the company competitive again, the damage to the brand that years of falling well short of Intel has caused won't be reversed overnight.
Here's what investors need to know about AMD's upcoming second-quarter report.
Image source: AMD.
Analysts are expecting AMD's second-quarter revenue to grow by 12.5% year over year on average to $1.16 billion, close to AMD's own guidance calling for a 12% increase. Shares of AMD slumped following its first-quarter report, in part because this guidance seemed pessimistic given the new products that were being launched.
Analysts see non-GAAP EPS coming in at break-even, an improvement from the $0.05 loss posted during the prior-year period. AMD expects its non-GAAP gross margin to be just 33%, down from 34% during the first quarter, driven by a mix shift toward semi-custom chip sales. For the full-year, analysts expect AMD to report non-GAAP EPS of $0.07, in-line with the company's expectations to turn a non-GAAP profit this year.
AMD expects to report low double-digit revenue growth in 2017, which suggests that the company doesn't expect significant market share gains to happen quickly. EPYC likely won't make much of an impact until next year, and the company has yet to launch gaming variants of its high-end Vega GPU. Ryzen will need to lead the way.
Shares of AMD are up nearly 650% since bottoming out early last year, driven mostly by optimism surrounding AMD's new products. The stock tumbled in May when the company last reported earnings, thanks to its guidance falling short of the expectations placed on the stock. Another case of weak guidance could send the stock tumbling anew.
AMD laid out some long-term targets during its Analyst Day event two months ago. The company expects to produce non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.75 by 2020, with non-GAAP gross margin reaching 40% thanks to a focus on premium products. AMD investors buying the stock today, for a price around $13.50 per share, are paying 18 times what AMD hopes to earn three years from now, excluding some costs like stock-based compensation.
AMD is going to need to hit those targets just to justify the current stock price. For further gains to make any sense, AMD will need to exceed those targets. That's certainly possible, especially with Intel seemingly caught off guard by the company's resurgence and facing significant execution issues. But a word of warning: That EPS target represents non-GAAP net income of about $700 million based on today's share count, substantially more than the company has produced in recent history.

In other words, AMD needs to set records in order to justify the current share price. Ryzen, Vega, and EYPC will need to be home runs, and AMD will likely need to get its semi-custom chips into the next generation of game consoles as well. That's an awful lot of optimism placed on a company with a spotty track record.
Investors will get the first good look at how Ryzen is selling on July 25. If AMD's results and guidance don't impress, watch out below.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the only two remaining makers of x86 processors, have been fierce rivals for decades. AMD nearly caught up to Intel in the PC market during the early 2000s, but it gave up those gains over the past decade as Intel retaliated with new chips and fierce marketing blitzes.
But now the tables seem to have turned again. AMD is striking back at Intel with new processors for PCs and data centers, and Intel seems to be losing its competitive edge in both markets. I compared these two stocks last August, and concluded that AMD was a better buy.

Since that article was published, shares of AMD rallied 80%, while shares of Intel dipped 3%. Unfortunately, I didn't take my own advice and buy any AMD shares, since I thought the stock was too risky. Today, I'll take a fresh look at both stocks to see which chipmaker is the better long-term play at current prices.
AMD splits its business into two major segments -- the Computing & Graphics unit, which sells x86 chips and Radeon graphics cards; and the EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which provides SoCs (system on chips) for non-PC products like gaming consoles. Last quarter, 60% of AMD's revenue came from the Computing & Graphics unit, while the remaining 40% came from the EESC unit.
Intel's business has more moving parts. The Client Computing group, which mostly sells PC chips, accounted for 54% of its top line last quarter. 28% came from its Data Center group, which holds a near-monopoly in servers with its Xeon chips. The remaining 18% is mainly split between its non-volatile memory, Internet of Things (IoT), programmable chips, and security businesses.
AMD has posted four straight quarters of annual revenue growth, which ended a multi-year streak of top line declines. That comeback was initially supported by the strength of its sales of SoCs for the PS4 and Xbox One, which turned the EESC unit into a pillar of growth.
AMD followed up that growth with new gaming GPUs last year, which dramatically lowered the price of ""VR ready"" PCs and widened its moat against NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). AMD then introduced its new Ryzen CPUs, which offered comparable performance as Intel's premium chips at much lower prices.
Analysts expect that momentum to continue, with 13% sales growth this year. AMD isn't consistently profitable yet, but it's expected to return to non-GAAP profitability later this year.
Source: AMD.
Intel has posted six straight quarters of positive annual sales growth, but it missed top line expectations during three of those quarters. That was mostly due to two big problems: sluggish PC sales and long upgrade cycles reducing demand for its PC chips, and weak enterprise spending throttling sales of its data center chips.
Those problems are now compounded by AMD's new CPUs for PCs and servers, as well as numerous other challengers in the data center market. Intel plans to counter AMD with its next-gen 10nm ""Cannon Lake"" chips, but those chips probably won't arrive until late 2017 or early 2018 -- which gives AMD ample time to steal market share. Despite these headwinds, analysts still expect Intel to post 1% sales growth and 5% earnings growth this year.
AMD's future relies heavily on its ability to gain enough momentum against NVIDIA and Intel with pre-emptive strikes. It's striking NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal chips with its newer Vega chips, but NVIDIA will retaliate a few months later with its next-gen Volta chips.
Its Ryzen chips may gain ground against Intel's current-gen Skylake and Kaby Lake chips, but it's unclear how they'll fare against Intel's updated 14nm Coffee Lake and 10nm Cannon Lake chips. It's also unclear if enough gamers will buy the recently updated Xbox One and PS4 consoles to support its EESC business.
Intel's future relies on its ability to stay ahead of the tech curve. But it's struggling to shrink its chips further, and its core PC and data center customers aren't in a hurry to upgrade. NVIDIA is also throwing a wrench into its data center business with GPUs which process machine learning tasks faster than stand-alone CPUs.
Intel's response is to expand into adjacent markets like IoT devices, memory chips, and connected cars. But those businesses simply aren't important enough to offset its weaknesses in PCs and data centers.
Yet Intel still beats AMD in terms of dividends and valuations. Intel pays a forward yield of 3.1%, which is easily supported by a payout ratio of 45%. AMD doesn't pay a dividend.
Intel trades at 15 times earnings and 3 times sales -- compared to the industry average P/E of 25 and P/S of 4 for semiconductor makers. AMD doesn't have a trailing P/E, since it hasn't been consistently profitable, but its P/S ratio of 3 merely matches Intel's.
Intel's high yield and low valuation should limit its downside from current levels, but AMD has more room to grow. It's definitely the riskier stock, but it could climb much higher if its pre-emptive attacks against Intel and NVIDIA do some damage.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have exploded since bottoming out in early 2016, gaining an astonishing 650% since hitting its lowest point 17 months ago. Anticipation has been the main driver of these gains, with investors betting that a slate of new products would return the company to its former glory.
Ryzen, AMD's new line of PC CPUs, launched in March, with high-end chips coming first and mainstream chips coming later. EPYC, AMD's latest foray into the server chip market, was detailed last month. And Vega, the company's first serious attempt at a high-end GPU in years, is now available in a professional card, with gaming cards coming soon.
The stock has been volatile in 2017, with the price swinging up and down due to product launches and for various other reasons. A thoroughly debunked rumor that AMD had licensed its graphics technology to rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) drove some big gains and some big losses, and graphics card shortages created by intense, but likely ephemeral, demand from cryptocurrency miners have been pushing up the stock in recent months.

AMD data by YCharts.
Trading around $14 per share, AMD's stock price already bakes in quite a bit of optimism. During AMD's analyst day event in May, the company laid out its long-term goal of producing $0.75 in adjusted earnings per share by 2020. The stock already trades for around 18 times what AMD hopes to earn three years from now, so for the stock to rise further, AMD will need to outperform its own expectations.
There are plenty of reasons why AMD stock could tumble from here, and an optimistic valuation is one of them. But if Ryzen, EPYC, and Vega gain more market share than expected, the stock could move higher in the long run.
Both high-end Ryzen 7 and mainstream Ryzen 5 desktop chips are already available. Threadripper, AMD's 12 to 16 core flagship high-end CPUs, will be available in August, and the low-end Ryzen 3 chips are expected to launch soon. Ryzen Pro CPUs aimed at enterprise users launched earlier this month, and the first laptops featuring Ryzen Mobile chips will be available during the second half of this year.
Image source: AMD.
With Ryzen, AMD is betting that offering more cores at lower price points compared to Intel products will offset the disadvantage the chips have when it comes to single-threaded performance. The 16-core Threadripper CPU, for example, will cost $999, compared to $1999 for the soon-to-be-launched 18-core Intel Core i9-7980XE and $999 for the 10-core i9 7900X.
The Ryzen chips that have launched so far come with trade-offs. Gaming performance is mixed, in part due to weaker single-threaded performance compared to Intel chips, while performance in applications that make full use of the extra cores is stellar. Ryzen has certainly put Intel on the defensive, but it's far from a knockout blow.
AMD's market share gains with Ryzen will be gradual, but if the company can take back a meaningful portion of the market over the next few years, especially at the high end, the bottom line will get a nice boost. Some market share gains are already baked into AMD's 2020 earnings guidance, so it will take gains beyond those expectations to justify a higher stock price. That will be easier said than done, but it's certainly possible.
AMD's server chip market share is essentially zero, as its products haven't been competitive in years. EPYC, formerly known under the code name Naples, is AMD's attempt to break back into the market. Details were unveiled in May, and by all indications, it looks like EYPC has a good shot at making AMD a meaningful player in the server chip market once again.
Image source: AMD.
Intel has already announced and launched new Xeon server chips to combat this threat, boasting that it's already sold 500,000 of its Xeon Scalable chips to large customers. AMD will look to undercut Intel when it comes to price to performance, but like Ryzen, Intel's superior single-threaded performance will act as a headwind.
AMD will win some market share, but it will be a slog clawing away sales from Intel. Even optimistic analysts with buy ratings on the stock are being realistic. An analyst from Jefferies, for example, expects AMD to claim just 7% of the total server market by the end of 2018.
But even small gains in market share will boost revenue and earnings. Again, AMD's 2020 earnings guidance assumes some market share gains already. But if EPYC can outperform those expectations, a higher stock price might be in the cards.
Polaris, AMD's mainstream GPU launched about a year ago, led to some market share gains but not much else. AMD's computing and graphics segment remains unprofitable, and the Polaris graphics cards have made little progress winning over gamers, according to Steam's hardware and software survey.
Image source: AMD.
The high end of the graphics card market belongs entirely to NVIDIA, a situation that was unchanged by AMD's last attempt to launch a high-end card in 2015. Vega could be a different story. The Vega Frontier Edition, the only Vega graphics card available at the moment, is aimed at professional users. The gaming versions are expected to launch in the next few months.
AMD may have a tougher time winning market share in the GPU market compared to the CPU market. While Intel has enjoyed years of essentially no competition at all, a situation that appears to have led to overconfidence on Chipzilla's part, NVIDIA has been pushing the envelope, driving hard to make its GPUs the standard for artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and other non-gaming applications. It's unlikely that Vega will catch NVIDIA off guard.
But like the server market, AMD has no real presence in the high-end GPU market, so even modest market share gains would be a major positive. It's unclear how much market share AMD expects to win over the next few years, but if Vega can outperform those expectations, the current stock price may not be optimistic enough.

            ","The latest market share numbers for the central processing unit (CPU) space put together by PassMark gave Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) investors a rude awakening. The chip giant is losing its vice-like grip over the CPU market because of stiff competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), whose latest CPU lineup seems to have captured consumers' attention.
PassMark's PerformanceTest, which is used to test PC speeds and compare the performance of different PCs, puts AMD's share of the x86 microprocessor market at 23.4% at the beginning of the third quarter of 2017, while Intel has the rest. By comparison, AMD's market share stood at just 17.5% in the prior-year period, so it has gained a significant portion of this market from Intel's clutches.

There are limitations to the benchmarking utility, as it can count results only from those users who use its benchmarking tool. Additionally, the benchmarking software can run only on the Windows platform, so it doesn't present the complete picture of the CPU market.
Still, it is now evident that AMD's new Ryzen CPUs are gaining in popularity as more users are testing PCs made on this platform on PassMark. The good news for AMD's investors is that it isn't done yet -- more Ryzen CPUs are going to hit the market in the coming months.
AMD has charted out a smart marketing blitz to corner a bigger share of the CPU market. The company launched its Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 processors for the consumer market in the first six months of 2017. The market share gains indicate that these two processors have helped AMD gain traction in high-end PCs, and it is now working its way toward the mid-tier segment with the Ryzen 3 chips that were teased earlier in July.
The high-end Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 processors have given consumers a value-for-money proposition when compared to Intel's chips. If AMD can price the Ryzen 3 processors smartly, it can make a dent in the mid-range PC hardware market that accounts for an estimated 35% of sales.
Additionally, AMD has started targeting the commercial CPU market with the surprise launch of the Ryzen PRO line of CPUs. AMD seems to have strung together an impressive CPU lineup in terms of specifications when compared to Intel, which could give the former a substantial boost if it can price them right.
Furthermore, AMD isn't going to miss out on the laptop and notebook market either as it is set to launch its Ryzen Mobile and mobile Ryzen PRO chips later this year and in the first half of 2018, respectively. The roll-out of the mobile chips is estimated to boost the company's serviceable addressable market by another $10 billion, and also increase its chances of improving its CPU market share with a comprehensive product lineup.
Intel has been trying a number of moves to fight back against AMD in the premium desktop market. First, it decided to slash prices of its CPUs, though this ploy hasn't worked for it as the market share losses indicate. Now Intel has decided to try to upstage AMD by launching chips with superior specifications for high-end PCs.
For instance, its Core i9 Extreme CPU packs in more threads and cores compared to AMD's flagship offering, the Threadripper. Intel seems to be trying to seize the marketing initiative back from AMD as it tries to push the sales of the recently launched Skylake-X processors.
Not surprisingly, Intel is targeting the high-end desktop market with Skylake-X in a bid to regain the momentum in this high-margin space where average selling prices are on the higher side. 
Only time will tell if Intel is packing enough into its new chips to break AMD's impressive run in the CPU space, though it will need to match the latter in terms of pricing as well. But given the way AMD has captured consumers' attention by launching one Ryzen chip after the other and boasting their superior capabilities at the same time, Intel will have its task cut out for it.

            ","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) controls about 99% of the data center CPU market with its flagship Xeon chips. But over the past few years, the growth of that unit has been throttled by slower enterprise spending and longer upgrade cycles.
That slowdown has been a dead weight on Intel's top line, and a major factor in analysts downgrading the stock. But that slowdown could also be great news for three disruptive players in the data center market -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
Source: Getty.
NVIDIA's high-end Tesla GPUs are now widely used in data centers for machine learning and other AI-related tasks. That's because GPUs are generally faster than stand-alone CPUs at those tasks. As a result, NVIDIA's data center revenue surged 186% annually to $409 million last quarter and accounted for over a fifth of the company's top line.
But looking ahead, NVIDIA's data center plans look even more disruptive. It recently unveiled its DGX-1 supercomputer, which puts ""400 servers"" into a single box powered by eight Tesla V100 GPUs and two 20-core Intel Xeon E5-2698 processors. Its $149,000 price tag looks steep, but it's certainly cheaper, more power efficient, and occupies less space than 400 servers.
NVIDIA's growth in this market has triggered alarm bells at Intel. Its new ""Knights Landing"" Xeon Phi CPUs aim to deliver comparable machine learning performance as NVIDIA's GPUs, but it's unclear if NVIDIA's growing list of data center GPU customers -- which includes Facebook, IBM, and Baidu -- will give Intel a chance.

AMD already landed a solid punch against Intel earlier this year with Ryzen, its new PC chip, which offers comparable performance as Intel's current-gen chips at much lower prices. But it's also targeting Intel's data center market with its new Epyc chips. AMD claims that the Eypc offers 45% more cores, 122% more bandwidth, and 60% greater I/O bandwidth than Intel's comparable Xeon chips, but at much lower price points.
To make matters worse for Intel, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Baidu recently announced that they would install Epyc chips in their data centers. These tech giants support AMD because breaking up Intel's near-monopoly in data center chips would result in healthier competition and lower market prices.
This represents a major strategic shift from AMD's previous server strategy, which attempted to use ARM-based ""microservers"" to carve out a niche with smaller businesses. While that effort failed, going head-to-head with Intel in the high-end market with the support of major data center operators might actually work.
While AMD is assaulting the x86 server market, Qualcomm -- the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world -- is making a major move against Intel with high-powered ARM chips. It recently launched the ARM-based Centriq 2400, the world's first 10nm SoC, in a bid to dent Intel's data center dominance.
As we saw with AMD's microserver efforts, ARM chips couldn't challenge Intel's Xeons in the past because they mainly focused on lower-end niche markets. But the Centriq represents an aggressive push into the high-end market to directly challenge Intel. Qualcomm is jumping ahead of Intel in terms of architecture (Intel is still shipping 14nm chips), and the 48 cores on the Centriq's Falkor CPU represent double the core count of Intel's E7 Broadwell processors.
Just as with AMD, major tech companies are backing Qualcomm's efforts. Microsoft, for example, partnered with Qualcomm to power its Azure cloud platform and Windows Server with Centriq SoCs. The message is clear -- big data center operators will likely partner with any chipmaker that has a shot at disrupting Intel's data center dominance.
Challengers like NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm have put Intel in a tough position. It must beef up the Xeon's machine learning capabilities so data center operators don't buy GPUs and postpone CPU upgrades, and it must defend its turf against direct challengers like Epyc and Centriq -- which are backed by industry giants like Microsoft. Unless Intel formulates a clear game plan for countering these threats, its data center growth could remain dismal and throttle its top line growth for the foreseeable future.

            ","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) investors haven't been a happy lot over the past year as the stock is sitting about where it was last July. The microprocessor giant is dealing with a declining PC market even as it has made big bets on fast-growing areas such as data centers, the Internet of Things, self-driving cars, and high-end PCs. Though these moves have increased  the company's revenue of late, they have failed to translate into stock price gains.
And Intel faces competition from the likes of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the areas where it's betting big for future growth. Let's take a closer look at three big hurdles the chip giant might face.

Intel is spending billions of dollars to jump on the self-driving-car bandwagon, announcing in March its plan to acquire Mobileye for around $15 billion and partnering this year with BMW and Delphi. But Intel has been late to the game, as graphics chipmaker NVIDIA made its move in this space two years ago, when it launched the DRIVE PX platform.
NVIDIA is now readying its third generation self-driving-car platform, powered by the new Xavier chip, which will start sampling to automakers and component suppliers in the final quarter of 2017. The company has equipped this new platform with more power, with a single Xavier chip packing 80% of the compute power of the DRIVE PX2 platform.
By comparison, the existing DRIVE PX2 platform requires two mobile processors and two graphics processing units. Therefore, NVIDIA can now deliver an identical performance at just a fraction of the power consumption of the earlier generation. What's more, NVIDIA has future-proofed the Xavier chip, as it carries enough juice to enable Level 4 autonomous driving, which doesn't require human intervention under some circumstances.
In fact, NVIDIA believes it can deliver Level 4 autonomous technology by the end of next year. It already seems to be making progress on this front, as it showcased a Xavier-powered self-driving car earlier this year that can learn real-world conditions and then drive accordingly.
NVIDIA is ahead of Intel in the self-driving-car game, as the latter has yet to complete the Mobileye acquisition while its alliance partners will put their self-driving cars on roads for testing in the second half of the year while NVIDIA's self-driving-car system is already being tested in real-world conditions.
Intel has long dominated the field in server and CPU chips, but it's now feeling the heat from Advanced Micro Devices' new product line-ups in both segments. In fact, Intel ceded 2% market share to AMD in the first quarter of 2017, according to PassMark, as the latter's Ryzen 7 processor hit the market.
But AMD isn't done yet, as more Ryzen processors are on the way. This could be a big headache for Intel, since AMD is trying to undercut Intel's CPUs by offering more value for the money. In fact, Intel has already been forced to slash its CPU prices to ward off competition from AMD, which could eventually hurt the chip giant's margins.
Furthermore, AMD is looking to strike deeper into Intel's heart with its new server processor known  as EPYC. AMD talked up the superior performance of EPYC at the launch event, indicating that it can beat Intel's offerings across several price points. This could trigger another round of price cuts by Intel.
So AMD has the potential to shake Intel's dominance in server chips where it has a near-monopoly.
Intel investors should keep an eye on these two competitors.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has rallied 170% over the past 12 months, but that ride was a volatile one. I recently reviewed some of AMD's biggest weaknesses, noting that the underdog chipmaker's future depended heavily on landing some heavy blows against NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). 
But today I'll take a more optimistic view on AMD, and see why its best days might still be ahead as it counters NVIDIA and Intel with new chips.

AMD gained a temporary edge against NVIDIA in the GPU market when it launched its low to mid-range Polaris-based GPUs last year. But then NVIDIA struck back hard with new Pascal-based cards, which undercut AMD's cheapest cards and crushed them in the high-end market in terms of performance.
But looking ahead, AMD plans to launch its next-gen GPU, Vega, for mainstream consumers during the summer. Early benchmarks already indicate that the high-end Vega Frontier Edition, which was recently launched for enterprise customers, beats NVIDIA's Pascal-based Tesla P100 in deep learning capabilities. This indicates that AMD may enjoy an early lead against NVIDIA in the GPU market until its next-gen Volta chips arrive next year.
It's unclear how AMD's Vega will measure up against NVIDIA's Volta GPUs, but AMD is already reportedly developing ""Vega 2.0"" GPUs to counter Volta next year. If AMD can offer performance comparable to that of NVIDIA's Volta GPUs at lower prices, it could regain market share against NVIDIA in both mainstream gaming GPUs and high-end data center GPUs.
AMD also has plenty of ways to hurt Intel. Industry benchmarks already show that AMD's new Ryzen CPUs offer comparable performance to Intel's high-end Core i7 CPUs at much lower prices. Intel won't launch its next-gen chip architecture, the 10nm Cannonlake, until next year -- which could give AMD plenty of time to gain market share at its expense.

AMD is also targeting Intel's data center market with its Epyc chip, which challenges Intel's flagship Xeon chips for servers. Intel investors might scoff at the notion that AMD could dent Intel's 99% market share in servers, but Microsoft and Baidu both recently pledged to install Epyc chips in their data centers.
The reason is simple -- loosening Intel's iron grip on data center chips will encourage competition and drive down prices, thus reducing expenses for big data center operators. If other big tech companies decide to buy Epyc chips instead of Xeons, AMD could wound Intel's data center business, which is already struggling with sluggish demand.
One of AMD CEO Lisa Su's greatest accomplishments was the expansion of the company's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which offset the slower growth of its Computing and Graphics business. The EESC business grew because it provided custom SoCs for the PS4 and Xbox One -- the two best-selling consoles of the current gaming generation.
Looking ahead, upgraded and refreshed versions of both consoles (the PS4 Pro, PS4 Slim, Xbox One X, Xbox One S) could boost sales of those SoCs, especially as sales of the original versions slow down. More demanding VR titles for the PSVR could also boost sales of the upgraded PS4 Pro.

AMD stands to profit from the growing VR market in three different ways -- it could sell more VR ready GPUs for PCs, upgraded consoles for VR content, and SoCs for new stand-alone VR headsets. I previously warned investors not to put too much faith in these nascent markets, but they could strengthen AMD.
AMD's growth prospects look exciting, but investors should also be aware of the risks. Intel and NVIDIA have much deeper pockets for R&D and marketing, and AMD remains unprofitable. If push comes to shove, AMD needs to really impress mainstream and enterprise customers to remain ahead of both companies' next-gen chips.
Nonetheless, AMD looks reasonably valued at 2.7 times sales, which is lower than the industry average of 3.7 for semiconductor makers. I'd either keep an eye on AMD or possibly take a small position for now, but I definitely wouldn't go all-in on this stock or make it a core position in my portfolio.

            ","Shares of  Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 11.5% in June, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Last month was a roller coaster, much like the rest of AMD's tumultuous year. The stock surged on rising cryptocurrency prices and the launch of a good-looking server chip series under the EPYC brand. And then AMD's shares tumbled when analyst firm Goldman Sachs pointed out that the stock might be overpriced even if everything works out exactly as planned -- in short, all the good news has been priced into the stock already, and then some.

The well-received Polaris line of graphics chips and Ryzen CPUs are doing wonders for AMD's stock chart and bottom line, but it's been a really bumpy ride. Share prices have skyrocketed 167% higher over the last 52 weeks, but the year-to-date gains cooled down to just 18%. The stock is as likely to make a sudden jump as it is to come crashing down, and it doesn't take much of a news item to trigger either one of those moves.

AMD was always a volatile stock, but the one-year beta has never been higher than the current reading of 6.3. I mean never, including the unstable periods around the rise of the common PC system, the dot-com bubble inflating and then popping, and the terrific launch of the good old Athlon processor. AMD's stock market moves have simply never been as unpredictable as they are right now.
I wish I could tell you what will happen when the company reports its second-quarter results roughly a month from now, but I can't -- and in all honesty, neither can anybody else. AMD's ticker is a gambler's dream and an investor's worst nightmare nowadays.

            ","Shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) have been on a run over the past year, rising 234% as of June 19 as its aggressive focus on the fast-growing graphics processing unit (GPU), automotive, and data center markets has led to terrific financial growth.

NVDA data by YCharts
Not surprisingly, Wall Street has remained largely bullish on NVIDIA, with a number of analysts bumping up their earnings per share (EPS) targets in the past month.
But investors shouldn't get carried away by the GPU specialist's terrific run. Rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are ramping up their capabilities in three of its key markets, which could potentially hurt the chipmaker's growth. Let's see how.
NVIDIA gets most of its dough by selling GPUs for PC gamers. The gaming segment accounts for 53% of its total revenue, but the chipmaker is now feeling the heat from AMD.
AMD has made rapid gains in GPU market share, controlling 27.5% of this space in the first quarter of 2017 as per estimates by Jon Peddie Research, up from 23.2% in the first quarter of 2016, indicating that its strategy of providing powerful GPUs at affordable prices is bearing fruit.
But AMD is now going to hit NVIDIA in the high-end GPU market, where margins are higher, with its Vega GPUs. The company's Radeon Vega Frontier edition GPU is priced at $1,200 for the air-cooled version. This puts NVIDIA's top-of-the-line GPU, the Titan Xp, right in AMD's sights as it is priced similarly.

Independent benchmark tests indicate that AMD's offering trumps NVIDIA's recently launched Titan Xp in key areas including computational power and bandwidth memory. AMD is aiming for NVIDIA's leadership in high-end GPUs that tackle virtual reality (VR) workloads in a bid to boost margins.
Additionally, AMD is expected to unveil its consumer edition Vega GPUs in late July and could start selling them before the holiday season, which is typically a strong period for GPU sales. NVIDIA investors, therefore, should be wary of AMD's aggressive product development as the latter could make further inroads into the GPU market once its new graphics cards hit the market.
NVIDIA's data center business has grown at a terrific pace and is now its second-largest source of revenue after gaming. In fact, the company's data center revenue jumped 186% year over year during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, thanks to the massive uptake of its Tesla GPUs in data center applications.
NVIDIA's Tesla GPU accelerators for the data center are being used by the likes of Tencent, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet as they are capable of significantly boosting computational power at very low costs.
The graphics specialist lays great stress on Tesla's capability of powering artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the cloud. It made a big move in this space earlier this year by partnering with Microsoft to develop an AI platform that can be deployed across several applications including self-driving cars and healthcare. However, NVIDIA could potentially lose Alphabet's business since the latter has now decided to commercialize its own AI chip -- the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).
Earlier, Google's TPU only had inferencing capabilities (but not training capabilities), so it was relying on NVIDIA's chips. But the company has now added AI training capabilities to its second-generation TPU, and will start offering the same to the users of its cloud services through the Google Compute Engine.
This is a red flag for NVIDIA given the improving adoption of Google's cloud services, and could pose a bigger danger in the long run if Google decides to open-source the TPU and sell it to other cloud service providers.
NVIDIA's automotive business isn't a big money-maker yet, contributing just 7.2% of the overall revenue, but it could become a big deal in the long run as self-driving car adoption grows. The chipmaker has already penned deals with a number of automakers that are already using its technology in their cars.
However, Intel's recent moves in the self-driving car space could pose a challenge to NVIDIA's progress. The chip giant has been gradually gathering the pieces to accelerate its autonomous driving technology development, first by planning to acquire Mobileye and then bringing Delphi Automotive on board as a part of its alliance with BMW.
These four companies have already displayed their potential in self-driving car technology. For instance, Delphi has already integrated Intel's technology into an Audi SUV that was tested successfully in dense traffic in Silicon Valley, and it has also created an autonomous driving platform for BMW.
The alliance will start testing 40 autonomous cars in the second half of 2017 so that they can collect more data and improve their self-driving platform. This could be bad news for NVIDIA investors as Intel has strung together an impressive group of companies with diverse technological know-how to attack the self-driving car opportunity.
NVIDIA has been a stock market darling thanks to its rampant growth. But investors shouldn't forget the challenges that it might face in these key areas.

            ","The battle for the discrete graphics processing unit (GPU) market is getting more intense with each passing quarter, with both Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) trying to win a bigger slice of the pie with their latest products.
AMD is stealing market share away from NVIDIA, according to the latest data from Jon Peddie Research, with the former's stake in discrete GPUs rising impressively year over year during the first quarter (from 23.2% to 27.5%). Over the same time frame, NVIDIA's market share dropped from 76.7% to 72.5%, according to this research. Let's take a closer look at what's working in AMD's favor and whether it can continue making inroads into NVIDIA's stronghold.
Image source: AMD.
AMD staged a big comeback in 2016 with its Polaris GPU lineup. In fact, the Polaris architecture-based GPUs helped AMD gain 10 percentage points of market share in the sub-$299 GPU segment, boosting the company's overall GPU market share by 8 percentage points in 2016.
Therefore, AMD's gains were primarily driven by mid and entry-level GPUs last year, and the trend has continued in 2017. AMD did lose 2 percentage points of market share to NVIDIA on a quarter-to-quarter basis, according to the Jon Peddie data. But investors shouldn't read too much into this decline given the seasonal weakness in GPU shipments during the first quarter. Additionally, NVIDIA decided to rain on AMD's parade by slashing its GPU prices during the first quarter.
This isn't surprising, as NVIDIA's high-end cards were already close to a year old, so the company decided to move more units by reducing prices before its next-gen products hit the shelves. But the battle for GPU supremacy will heat up during the second half of the year as new products from both GPU specialists hit the market.
AMD investors expect the company's new Vega line of GPUs to help sustain the good work that Polaris began once they go online in the current quarter. In fact, the company has already scored a crucial win, as Apple's new top-of-the-line iMac Pro will be powered by the new Radeon Pro Vega GPU.
Apple is billing this device as the most powerful Mac ever built, setting its sights on the virtual reality (VR) market. iMac users will be able to dit 360-degree video with the help of AMD's new graphics card, which is the ideal requirement to create 3D VR content. Cupertino's push into VR could be a big deal for the company, as TechNavio forecasts that the VR content market will grow at an annual pace of 127% until 2020, with PCs being the preferred platform for content creation.

Gamers can expect AMD's new Vega GPUs to hit the shelves in June and July. However, AMD investors should brace for a lull in sales during the second quarter (April to June), as rival NVIDIA has already launched its new flagship GPU at aggressive prices.
NVIDIA's high-end GTX 1080 Ti and Titan Xp GPUs went on sale in March and April, respectively, so it might take some business away from AMD given its delayed launch. But AMD now has an advantage over NVIDIA, as it can strategically price its products to win more customers. What's more, AMD will have its Vega GPUs out in time before the seasonally strong third and fourth calendar quarters of the year, when shipments traditionally increase.

            ","The battle for the high-end PC market is heating up. In mid-May, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announced its most powerful central processing unit (CPU) for the consumer market, called the Threadripper. But CPU market leader Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) decided to fight fire with fire, launching an even more powerful consumer-focused CPU just two weeks later.
Why is Intel trying to match AMD step-for-step despite owning the lion's share of the CPU market?
Intel has tightened its grip on the CPU market over the past decade, currently estimated to hold an almost 80% share. But the chip giant has started feeling the heat from AMD's latest Ryzen CPU lineup, which PassMark, according to tweaktown.com, estimates gained 2% market share during the first quarter of 2017.
Image source: AMD.
The market-share gain was solely driven by the launch of the Ryzen 7 processor during the first quarter. AMD now has more firepower after launching Ryzen 5 during the second quarter, while the launch of the Ryzen 3 CPUs during the third quarter should provide another boost.
AMD's market-share gain can be attributed to the performance, pricing, and marketing blitz accompanying the Ryzen CPUs. For instance, the chipmaker's internal tests have consistently proved that Ryzen is far better than competing Intel chips at any budget, though investors should take the tests with a pinch of salt since they aren't independent.
But the market-share gain clearly indicates that the strategy is working as Ryzen has started gaining traction, allowing AMD to take business away from Intel. Not surprisingly, investors will expect AMD to further boost its market share once the full range of Ryzen CPUs hit the market. However, Intel is trying to rain on AMD's parade with a marketing blitz of its own.
AMD is stressing the fact that its CPUs deliver more value for money in terms of performance. This claim is corroborated by independent tests. For instance, UserBenchmark tests indicate that the Intel i7 6850K is just 4% faster than the Ryzen 7 1800X but is 9% costlier than AMD's offering.
This value-for-money proposition of AMD's chips, especially in the premium market, should be a worry for Intel investors, given that high-end systems account for much of PC sales.
This is why Intel has been forced to lower its CPU prices to ward off competition from AMD, but the chip giant can't go on cutting prices forever. Not surprisingly, Intel has now made a bold move by challenging AMD's flagship CPU offering with its latest product.
The company grabbed headlines late last month by packing its latest high-end CPU, the Core i9 Extreme, with superior specs. The top-of-the-line Intel Core i9 Extreme processor contains 18 cores and 36 threads, costing a shade under $2,000. But the company is also going to offer stripped-down versions of the processor, with the 10-core, 20-thread version costing $999.
By comparison, the Threadripper is powered by 16 cores and 32 threads, so Intel seems to have stolen AMD's thunder with its latest offering. But AMD can still bite Intel back by pricing the Threadripper aggressively.
Recent rumors suggest that AMD might price the entry-level Threadripper CPU at $849, which would make it cheaper than Intel's entry-level Core i9 offering. Such a big price difference could turn the balance in AMD's favor, since the cheaper Threadripper would carry better specs that would help it perform intensive  workloads in a more efficient way.
AMD's combination of pricing and performance could help it win more market share in the high-end CPU space.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged on Wednesday following the company's Tuesday afternoon unveiling of its EPYC server processors. Some positive analyst commentary added fuel to the fire. AMD stock was up about 9.2% at 3 p.m. EDT.
EPYC, formerly known under the code name Naples, is AMD's reentry into the server processor market. AMD's market share currently rounds down to zero, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) overwhelmingly dominant. AMD is looking to change that with EPYC.
Image source: EPYC.
AMD unveiled processors aimed at both one-socket and two-socket systems, providing specifications and approximate pricing. The chips range from 8 cores at the low end to 32 cores at the high end, with base frequencies between 2.0 GHz and 2.4 GHz. AMD provided benchmarks, which showed its EPYC chips handily outperforming comparable Intel Xeon chips in a particular test. Third-party reviews will be needed to provide an unbiased view of performance.
Analyst Mark Lipacis of Jefferies reiterated a ""buy"" rating on the stock and a $16 price target. Lipacis expects AMD to win 7% of the total server market by the end of next year. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley rated the stock ""equal weight,"" calling the launch impressive and suggesting that AMD might force Intel to lower its prices next year.
The launch comes soon after Intel shifted its focus more heavily toward the data center. Intel's strategy is now ""data center first,"" with its data center chips moving to new nodes before its PC chips. Intel's data center segment produced $17.2 billion of revenue and $7.5 billion of operating income last year, and the company will likely be aggressive in defending its market share.
How much share EPYC ultimately wins remains to be seen. The opportunity for AMD is measured in the billions of dollars, and it seems likely that Intel's data center margins will be crimped by this new competition. Optimism has returned after a disappointing first quarter. The billion-dollar question: Can AMD deliver?

            ","The market gave up ground on Tuesday, taking major benchmarks off their all-time highs from the previous day. Many market participants looked nervously at the energy markets, where more news of high inventory levels sent crude oil prices falling below the $43.50-per-barrel mark. Investors also seem uncertain about whether the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates earlier this month will prove to have been too quick in hindsight, and that prompted modest declines across the market.
However, some individual stocks still managed to score gains, and Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD), Vivint Solar (NYSE:VSLR), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Shares of Sears Holdings rose 7%, continuing the stock's string of erratic movements in both directions over the past couple of months. Sears has been going through a long process of consolidation and retrenchment, selling off valuable assets and trying to concentrate on what CEO Eddie Lampert and his executive team see as the core business for the ailing retailer. Yet operationally, Sears has struggled even more than the rest of the hard-hit retail industry, posting large operating losses when you remove the positive impact of profitable asset sales. With same-store sales plunging, cash reserves running out, and risk factors seeming to gain in prominence, Sears has become a speculative play rather than a long-term investment for most of those who are trading the stock.

Vivint Solar stock jumped nearly 20% after the rooftop solar installation specialist received favorable comments from a Wall Street analyst. Professionals at Goldman Sachs had good things to say about Vivint, upgrading its stock from neutral to buy and boosting their price target on the stock from $3.50 per share to $6. Goldman believes that Vivint's core business is on the upswing, and they also believe that other players in the industry might be inclined to see Vivint as a potential acquisition target. Some industry watchers aren't so sure that today's move has staying power, but for now, Vivint is enjoying the rise to its best levels since early 2016.
Finally, shares of Advanced Micro Devices gained 6%. Those following the maker of graphics chips and other semiconductors have noticed that AMD's stock has been tracking the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies recently, in large part because AMD graphics chips have traditionally been among the technology that bitcoin miners use in their mining efforts. The recent surge in bitcoin prices has resulted in a shortage of high-end Polaris graphics cards, and traders are excited about the boost that AMD could get from the trend. Yet long-term investors are more concerned about the fact that any positive impact from cryptocurrency-related demand will be only temporary, and many are skeptical that this boost in AMD stock will be any more sustainable than it was during earlier rounds of excitement concerning bitcoin and its peers.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has made its investors very happy over the last year. Share prices jumped 170% higher in 52 weeks, accompanied by a return to revenue growth and stabilizing bottom-line losses.
But the stock remains extremely volatile and seems ready to plunge if you just look at it the wrong way. Here are three of the biggest threats to AMD's lofty share prices today.
Image source: AMD.
Some 14% of AMD's float was sold short at the last available count, and the volatility measure we know as the beta value sits at an astronomically high 3.1.
More than 7% of AMD's market cap changes hands in your average market day. For comparative purposes, archrival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also widely seen as a volatile ticker, but only 2.2% of its shares are traded in an average day. For paragons of stability like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), that ratio stops far short of 1%.
These factors combine to form a hyper-volatile stock that's ready to jump or crash at the slightest of news. AMD's management has certainly done some good things to earn today's valuation in the nosebleed seats, but the company can't rest on those laurels for long. To keep the train rolling, AMD's management must continue to execute with surgical precision in the middle of several intensely cutthroat markets.
That's not an easy feat, and any slip-up will be punished with plunging share prices.
AMD might stumble if the company spreads its limited resources too thin. It wouldn't be the first company to fall prey to the peanut butter effect (and far from the last).
To wit, AMD is battling NVIDIA in a never-ending race for the graphics processor market and Intel when it comes to desktop, laptop, and server CPUs. At the same time, the company hopes to leverage its embedded and semi-custom chips to make inroads in the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence.
Each one of these end markets could be worth betting the farm on, and AMD could end up winning in several of them. At the same time, AMD often burns more cash than it generates and its debt balance is already larger than its cash reserves. The company's credit ratings are of the ""highly speculative"" breed and AMD is nursing an Altman Z score of -5.8. That bankruptcy-risk measure is particularly damning; an Altman Z score as high as 1.8 indicates a 70% chance of bankruptcy, and lower figures point to weaker balance sheets.
In other words, AMD is hardly in a position to risk significant capital, manpower, and assets on any particular growth vector, let alone a bucketful of them. The company is constantly at the edge of a precipice from a purely financial point of view.
Image source: Ethereum.org.
Lately, AMD and NVIDIA have made some noise about yet another potential growth driver. This one is nothing more than smoke and mirrors.
I'm talking about the exploding cryptocurrency market, which requires massive amounts of computing hardware to keep their financial and transactional platforms running. AMD and NVIDIA video cards are well-suited to this particular type of number-crunching (but hardly perfect -- hold that thought), so their video cards have been flying off the shelves to power cryptocurrency mining machines.
This has happened before, without adding any real value to NVIDIA or AMD shares. The last cryptocurrency surge was built around the Litecoin platform, and the bitcoin craze for graphics cards is fading into the mists of years past. This time, it's the Ethereum blockchain transaction service.
The earlier cryptocurrency platforms ultimately moved over to specialized application-specific integrated circuits, better known as ASIC chips. Ethereum was designed to use too much memory for a traditional ASIC approach, but hardware hackers will surely find a way around that limitation before long. Besides, the Ethereum platform is planning to move over to a completely different technology known as Proof of Stake, which will shake up the mining side of Ethereum drastically. When these things happen, Ethereum stops working as a sales driver for AMD and NVIDIA graphics chips.
Yet analysts are latching on to the Ethereum surge as a serious reason to own these stocks -- and AMD itself is fanning the flames. That's just short of dishonest marketing, and not at all a sustainable growth engine.
Smoke and mirrors, that's all. Whatever shareholder value the Ethereum craze has provided to AMD owners is likely to be short-lived.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) slumped 15.9% in May, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The major decline came at the beginning of the month, driven by AMD's first-quarter earnings report. While AMD's results were in line with expectations, its guidance was disappointing given the bevy of recent and upcoming product launches.
AMD reported Q1 revenue of $984 million, up 18% year over year, and a non-GAAP net loss of $0.04, up from a loss of $0.12 during the prior-year period. The computing and graphics segment produced a 29% year-over-year revenue increase, driven by the company's mainstream Polaris graphics cards and initial revenue from the launch of its Ryzen CPUs.
Image source: AMD.
With Q2 set to include a full quarter of Polaris sales, a full quarter of high-end Ryzen 7 sales, and nearly a full quarter of mainstream Ryzen 5 sales, as well as potentially some contribution from the launch of AMD's high-end Vega GPU and EPYC server chips, investors were no doubt expecting some impressive guidance.
But AMD failed to deliver that. The company guided for just 12% year-over-year revenue growth for Q2 and low double-digit revenue growth for the full year. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 33% during the  quarter, lower than the 34% reported for Q1. Considering that the company is debuting a full slate of new products this year, this forecast simply wasn't enough to prevent the stock from tumbling.
Shares of AMD have partially recovered in June, although it's been a roller coaster ride. News that demand from cryptocurrency miners had created shortages of AMD graphics cards drove up the stock, but a broad sell-off in tech stocks pushed it back down.
AMD's long-term target is to produce non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.75 by 2020.  The stock currently trades for nearly 16 times this number, which leaves very little room for error. Paying 16 times what a company hopes to earn three years from now, starting from being not profitable at all, is quite a leap of faith. Any indication that AMD will fall short of that goal could send the stock slumping.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has made terrific strides in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market in recent months by poaching market share from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). In fact, AMD grew its share from 20% in 2015 to 28% in 2016 as it saw a massive bump in sales of midrange GPUs priced below $299, according to estimates from Mercury Research.
Analysts, however, are now concerned with profit margins, as the company's market share gains have mostly come from low (price) hanging fruit. But investors should keep in mind that the company is taking aim at the higher end of the market with its next-generation GPU platform -- the Vega.
Internal company estimates suggest that the top-end GPU market accounts for less than 15% of sales but represents two-thirds of the margins. The company failed to break into this segment with the Polaris GPUs, which primarily target midrange desktops and below.

Therefore, the company is missing out on the most lucrative segment of the GPU market, but it believes that the Vega will help address this opportunity.
NVIDIA dominates the high-end GPU market, but AMD believes that its Vega GPUs are capable enough to compete against its rival's premium offerings. As it turns out, test results from the open-source Baidu DeepBench benchmark indicate that the Vega can outperform the NVIDIA P100 Tesla GPU in machine-learning applications by a fair margin.
Now, NVIDIA claims that the Tesla P100 is one of its most advanced GPUs, with the specs to substantially boost a data center's computing power while reducing costs by 60% simultaneously. NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs have already made significant inroads into the cloud-computing market, with the likes of Microsoft and Tencent using them to advance their artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
But AMD can make a dent in this market if Vega manages to outperform NVIDIA's top-of-the-line offering in independent machine intelligence tests. What's more, AMD isn't leaving anything to chance, as it has launched a number of open-source software solutions for developers to take advantage of its GPU accelerators.
The company's Radeon Open Compute platform is geared to support a variety of AI frameworks that include Facebook's Caffe and Google's TensorFlow machine learning library, among others. As such, it won't be surprising if the cloud-computing GPU market plays a critical role in driving results at AMD, especially since cloud data center workloads could grow at 26% a year until 2020, according to Cisco.
AMD believes that its expansion into high-end markets like cloud computing and machine intelligence will boost profit over time. The company expects gross margin to top 36% in 2018, up from about 31% last year. What's more, AMD expects further margin expansion -- to 40% or more -- by 2020 due to an improving product mix.
Of course, whether or not the company will enjoy this increased profitability depends on how its new products perform in the real world. But as something to keep investors bullish, AMD estimates the data center market alone will be a $21 billion opportunity in just a few years.

Investors will have to wait until later this year before the launch of the new Vega GPU. If AMD can deliver with an attractive offering to tackle next-generation cloud computing, its top and bottom lines will get a shot in the arm by capturing just a small slice of this burgeoning market.

Two semiconductor chip stocks made waves today: Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) rose thanks to a design win, and those of Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) fell after an earnings report.

AMD investors have been on a roller-coaster ride in recent months. After a fantastic 2016, during which shares almost quadrupled, the market pummeled the stock last month following AMD's Q1 earnings report, sending it down 24% in a single day. Announcements made in concert with Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday have reinvigorated the stock, with shares jumping 13.6% this week, including 2.9% today.
For decades, AMD has been locked in a battle with Intel for market share of CPU chips, the ""brains"" of personal computers. But with growth in PCs seemingly at an end, the semiconductor battleground has shifted elsewhere, and no market is hotter than the one for graphics processing units (GPUs), the muscular superchargers needed for compute-intensive applications such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, gaming, computer-generated imagery, and big data.
This week, AMD revealed new versions of its Radeon processors and announced that they will be shipping in updated 21.5- and 27-inch versions of Apple's iMac. In a press release, AMD Senior Vice President and Chief Radeon Technologies Group Architect Raja Koduri said: ""It is incredibly satisfying to see the capabilities of Radeon Pro 500 series in elegant form factors and enabling amazing content creation, gaming and VR experiences. Radeon Pro 500 Series graphics are enabling new generations of makers with compute-accelerated creative tools and new APIs, bringing their imaginations to life in ways like never before.""
AMD is focusing on lucrative opportunities at the high end of computing and has been making progress in battling Intel's dominance in server chips and high-end PCs. News this week provided some investor optimism that the company may take share from NVIDIA as well.
Shares of Ambarella, a maker of video processing chips, took a tumble today after the company announced first-quarter earnings Tuesday after market close. Good results were overshadowed by guidance for the upcoming quarter that the market perceived as weak. The company earned $0.07 per share, compared with $0.05 in the period last year, on sales of $64.1 million, up 12.2%. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding stock-based compensation and other items, was $0.39, compared with analyst expectations of $0.36. Revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter was $69 million to $72 million, whereas expectations were around the high end of that range.
Ambarella stock has a recent history of falling after earnings announcements despite beating expectations, and the pattern continued today, dropping 10.3%. The company has been fighting the headwind of slumping sales and high inventories of action cameras made by GoPro. But Ambarella is actually making good progress in diversifying away from its biggest customer, as CEO Fermi Wang explained: ""Q1 revenue of $64.1 million reflects our continued push to diversify our markets and customers with strong growth in the quarter coming from IP security cameras, including both professional and home monitoring markets, and continued growth in other cameras markets including wearable and automotive cameras. While our current markets continue to expand, we believe the combination of video with computer vision technology will be the real driver of new opportunities in both our current markets as well as emerging markets such as OEM automotive and robotics.""
The market has been tough on Ambarella in recent quarters, but long-term investors might start looking at the valuation, with the stock price only 13% above its 52-week low and a business that appears to be healthy.

            ","Graphics cards from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are sold out almost everywhere. A search on computer hardware retailer Newegg yields few options for AMD's higher-end Polaris cards, and those available are inflated in price. AMD confirmed to CNBC that demand from those mining cryptocurrencies is responsible for the shortage.
The price of bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has soared over the past few months, reigniting interest in cryptocurrencies. Specialized ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits, have been in use for bitcoin mining for years, rendering graphics cards largely obsolete for that purpose. Bitcoin mining is profitable when the value of the bitcoin produced outweighs the costs of running the hardware, and ASICs are vastly more energy efficient than graphics cards.
This surge in graphics card demand seems to be driven by another cryptocurrency, Ethereum. The price of Ethereum has also soared in recent months, drawing in those looking to profit by producing ""ether."" Ethereum is designed to be ASIC-resistant, which means that it would be expensive to design an ASIC that would outpace consumer hardware like graphics cards. AMD graphics cards tend to perform better than those from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) when it comes to cryptocurrency mining.
Shares of AMD shot up 7% on Tuesday based on this news, but investors shouldn't be celebrating. This isn't the first time cryptocurrency miners have scooped up AMD graphics cards to the point of shortage. The exact same thing happened in late 2013 -- Litecoin was the flavor of the week back then. That surge of demand did nothing for AMD's market share, and any benefit was short-lived. Litecoin prices quickly collapsed, and ASICs soon arrived. Litecoin was also billed as ASIC-resistant.

The fact that AMD's graphics cards are selling out seems like a positive, and it will certainly boost the company's results a bit in the short term. But this demand is unlikely to stick around for very long. If Ethereum continues to gain in price, it will eventually become viable for an ASIC to be developed that renders graphics cards obsolete. There are technical differences between Ethereum and Litecoin, beyond the scope of this article, that may make the former more resistant to ASIC development. But that will only delay the inevitable.
On the other hand, if this cryptocurrency surge turns out to be a massive bubble -- Dutch tulips for the digital age -- mining Ethereum won't be nearly as attractive once prices collapse. Either way, demand for AMD's graphics cards from cryptocurrency miners will dry up -- just like it did last time.
AMD can only sell as many GPUs as it produces, and I highly doubt the company will attempt to boost production significantly given the uncertain and ephemeral nature of this new source of demand. Cryptocurrency prices could fall off a cliff tomorrow, and AMD doesn't want to be stuck with a bunch of excess supply.
There's a second-order effect of this shortage: NVIDIA's graphics cards are now the only option for PC gamers. While AMD is racking up some extra sales from a source of demand that likely won't be around for very long, gamers will be pushed to NVIDIA. I would argue that this surge in demand for AMD's graphics cards is a net-negative in the long run.
This is now the second time that demand from cryptocurrency miners has created a shortage of AMD graphics cards. There was no long-term benefit for AMD the first time around, and I doubt it will be any different this time. Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been clobbered since the company dropped its first-quarter earnings report on May 1. Wall Street took issue with AMD's muted gross margin forecast, and analysts seem to be concerned with the company's ability to compete against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the server and the central processing unit (CPU) market.
But AMD isn't going to lay low after its latest setback. The semiconductor specialist has clearly spelled out its intention of going after Intel's stronghold at its 2017 analyst day, targeting premium PCs and X86 server processors with new products.
Back in March, AMD had announced that it is working on a new two-socket server processor architecture known as Naples, touting its superior specs as compared to Intel's flagship server offering. AMD has now provided more details regarding this new chip, which has been rebranded as Epyc.
Currently, Intel has a near-monopoly in x86 server chips, as it commands over 90% of this market. So, AMD had to bring a cutting-edge product to make its presence felt in this space, and it looks like Epyc is just what it needed.
Image source: AMD. 
AMD claims that its Epyc server chip will break the constraints of Intel's Moore's Law by improving product yields and reducing manufacturing costs, while its scalable nature will help deliver a substantial boost in performance as compared to its rival. In fact, AMD has packed the Epyc chip with 45% more cores than Intel's competing chip, 60% more input/output capacity, and 122% more bandwidth memory.
Image source: AMD. 
AMD's internal tests establish Epyc's dominance over a typical Intel server chip, thanks to its superior configuration as it packs more power in a smaller form factor. In fact, AMD claims that the single-socket performance of Epyc is 50% more powerful than Intel's two-socket chips, while also providing the benefit of lower power consumption, which should lead to lower operating expenses.
More specifically, AMD believes that Epyc's performance advantage could help it reduce the total cost of ownership of data center servers by up to 30%. This could help the company disrupt the market for two-socket server chips, which accounts for 80% of the overall x86 server market.
Investors should probably take AMD's performance comparisons against Intel's server chips with a grain of salt, as these tests aren't independent. But if AMD indeed manages to deliver real-world performance gains against Intel, and prices Epyc right, it can make a dent in the global data-center server market that's expected to grow at almost 5% a year until 2021.
AMD has started to aggressively target a $39 billion opportunity in client computing and discrete graphics processing units by going against Intel in the high-end PC CPU market with its latest offerings.
AMD's computing revenue growth is already outpacing the overall market. It won't be a big surprise if the trend continues, as AMD is trying to reenter the premium end of the market, which should lead to higher average selling prices and better margins.
AMD has already increased its total addressable market by $9 billion thanks to the launch of the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 series of central processing units (CPUs) in the first half of 2017, which are aimed at premium desktop customers. As it turns out, the current Ryzen lineup is already in strong demand by PC builders, with more Ryzen-based desktops on the way this quarter.
The good news for AMD investors is that the new CPU lineup is winning back market share. In fact, during the first quarter, the Ryzen CPUs led to a 2% increase in AMD's CPU market share. The company finally made a dent in Intel's stronghold for the first time in a decade.
AMD will continue to launch more Ryzen CPUs aimed at the commercial market for workstations and laptops, along with consumer laptops, through the first half of the next year to boost its total addressable market by another $10 billion. It won't be surprising if it continues to take more market share away from Intel once its full range of Ryzen CPUs hit the market.
AMD stock had a tough time after the company's latest results, but investors shouldn't worry, as its new CPUs have started gaining traction, allowing it to break into Intel's market. The launch of the Epyc server chips will give AMD's top line another boost as it takes on Intel, setting the stage for stronger long-term growth.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), which rallied nearly 140% over the past 12 months, is a highly divisive stock among tech investors. The bulls believe that AMD's new x86 Ryzen CPUs and upcoming Vega GPUs can strike critical blows against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in their respective markets. The bears meanwhile note that AMD repeatedly failed to beat both bigger chipmakers in the past, and that too much of its future relies on the Ryzen and Vega's success. While I'm not bearish on AMD, I believe that investors should still worry about several major headwinds facing the company.
Image source: AMD.
AMD stole the spotlight from NVIDIA last June by launching the RX 480, which was the cheapest ""VR ready"" card on the market at $200. But over the next few months, NVIDIA struck back across the low-end market with the GTX 1050 ($109), GTX 1050 Ti ($139), and the GT 1030 ($80).
The GTX 1050 Ti was approved by Oculus last October, making it the cheapest VR ready card on the market. AMD responded by lowering the price of its VR-ready RX 470 from $179 to $169, but that low-end card still remained pricier than the GTX 1050 Ti.
AMD's next big push against NVIDIA will be the launch of its next-gen Vega cards this summer, which could overtake NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal cards in terms of raw graphical horsepower. However, it's unclear how long that lead will last, since NVIDIA will likely launch its next-gen Volta GPUs for mainstream consumers in early 2018. This upcoming clash could follow the same cycle as the low-end GPU battle last year, with AMD winning the initial benchmarks but provoking a fierce retaliation from NVIDIA.
The two major gaming consoles -- the PS4 and Xbox One -- are both powered by AMD SoCs. The revenue from those consoles is the core pillar of growth for AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit.
However, NVIDIA's Tegra chip now powers the Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) Switch, which has been stealing the spotlight from the PS4 and Xbox One with its hybrid design and well-received launch titles. The Switch's success shows that NVIDIA's Tegra has the graphical muscle for hybrid devices, which bodes well for its future in other smaller devices -- like AR/VR headsets, set-top boxes, gaming tablets, or other handheld devices.

When NVIDIA's graphics licensing deal with Intel expired earlier this year, NVIDIA stopped receiving $66 million in ""free"" revenue per quarter. Earlier this month, rumors suggested that Intel would sign a graphics deal with AMD to replace that deal and give AMD a much-needed injection of ""free"" revenue. However, Intel later claimed that report was false.
AMD's new Ryzen chip recently impressed investors when initial benchmarks showed that the top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X matches Intel's 8-core Core i7-6900K in single-threaded performance, and beats it in multi-threaded performance -- for half the price. But here's the catch -- the 14nm Ryzen is considered a next-gen chip for AMD, while the Core i7 in the comparison is Intel's current-gen 14nm Kaby Lake chip.
AMD also plans to loosen Intel's iron grip on the data center market with Naples, a high-end Zen processor that has more cores than Intel's current-gen Skylake-based Purley CPU. But once again, this is technically a next-gen to current-gen comparison.
Intel isn't sitting idly by and letting itself get overtaken by AMD. On the PC front, it plans to launch its newer Coffee Lake (14nm) and next-gen Cannonlake (10nm) chips near the end of 2017. On the server front, Intell could soon release an updated version of Purley which boasts just as many cores (32) as Naples.
The problem with AMD is that it needs its next-gen chips to gain enough traction against NVIDIA and Intel before those bigger rivals strike back with potentially faster chips.
If you're a PC owner who wants to upgrade an aging desktop PC, you're likely wondering if you should buy AMD's Ryzen and Vega chips this year, or wait and buy Intel's Cannonlake CPUs and NVIDIA's Volta GPUs instead. Big companies will likely want to see comparisons between Naples and the new Purley chips before authorizing any sweeping upgrades.
I'm not saying that AMD is a bad buy at current levels -- it's actually fairly cheap at 2.2 times sales (relative to the industry average of 4 for semiconductor makers). But investors would be foolish not to worry, since AMD's future depends heavily on NVIDIA and Intel's new chips falling short of market expectations.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) often cites the growth of the virtual reality market as the next big catalyst for its GPU and semi-custom SoC businesses. The logic is simple -- demand for its cheap low-end ""VR ready"" GPUs for PCs will grow as headsets like the Oculus Rift and Vive become more popular, while upgraded consoles for VR titles will bolster sales of the semi-custom SoCs it provides for the Xbox One and PS4.
Many analysts concur. Last year, Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Ramsay noted that the ""emergence of VR and 4K content"" would hasten the console upgrade cycle, and ""serve as a benefit to semi-custom volumes for AMD."" But before investors put their faith in AMD's potential growth in VR, they should consider the possibility that analysts might be wrong about the VR market's future.
Image source: Getty Images.
Despite the widely hyped launches of Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift, HTC's Vive, and Sony's PlayStation VR last year, the virtual reality market remains a niche one. According to SuperData Research, 6.3 million VR headsets were shipped last year. That's a paltry figure compared to the 57.9 million PS4s and 29.5 million Xbox Ones that have been shipped so far.
Samsung dominated the market with 4.5 million shipments of its $99 Gear VR, which is paired with is high-end devices and tethered to Facebook's Oculus Home ecosystem. All of the other pricier headsets sold fewer than 1 million units.
The relative popularity of the Gear VR is troublesome for AMD, because the device doesn't require any of its chips. Instead, the headset is powered by Samsung and Qualcomm's mobile chips within the paired smartphones. Meanwhile, the $500 Rift and $800 Vive -- which are both tethered to pricier, high-end gaming PCs -- remain too expensive and cumbersome for mainstream consumers.
AMD initially impressed gamers last year with the RX 480, a $200 card which was the cheapest ""VR ready"" GPU on the market. But that victory was short-lived -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) subsequently launched the GTX 1050 Ti, a $140 card which was also dubbed ""VR ready"" by Oculus.
AMD's RX 480. Image source: AMD.
The GTX 1050 Ti -- along with non-VR ready cards like the GTX 1050 ($109) and GT 1030 ($80) -- mark a major escalation of the ongoing price wars between the two GPU makers. These battles will inevitably lower the price of ""VR ready"" GPUs over the next few years and dull AMD's competitive edge.
Another troubling shift is the current movement to cut both smartphones and PCs out of the VR loop. Facebook and Alphabet's Google both recently revealed plans for stand-alone VR headsets that don't require PCs.
If these companies remove PCs from the VR equation, it's likely that sales of ""VR ready"" GPUs will decline. AMD might offset that decline by leveraging its reputation in gaming consoles to sell custom SoCs for those VR headsets, but it could still face tough competition from NVIDIA -- which currently supplies the Tegra SoC for Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) popular Switch console.
Image source: Nintendo.
Nintendo's use of the Tegra indicates that NVIDIA's chip provides plenty of graphical horsepower in a small, tablet-sized package. NVIDIA's VRWorks SDK (software development kit) for VR developers also directly counters AMD's similar SDK, LiquidVR. As a result, AMD might not dominate stand-alone VR headsets in the same way it did with current-gen gaming consoles.
Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that the VR market could be worth $25 billion by 2021, while many companies and analysts believe that VR could be the next big computing platform. While that could still happen, investors should keep an eye on several key trends.
If the mainstream adoption of higher-end VR headsets doesn't accelerate this year, the VR market could remain a niche one. If smartphone-based VR headsets continue outperforming PC-based ones, companies like Samsung and Qualcomm would benefit more than AMD.
If stand-alone headsets alter the market, AMD could become locked in a tough SoC battle against NVIDIA -- which mirrors the two companies' current battle in PC-based GPUs. Therefore, AMD investors shouldn't panic, but they should take any claims that VR will be a huge growth catalyst with a grain of salt.

            ","Shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) have rallied more than 210% over the past 12 months, fueled by robust demand for its gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and CPUs for connected cars. But after that huge run, NVIDIA now trades at 53 times earnings -- more than double the industry average of 26 for semiconductor makers.
Therefore, investors might hesitate to buy NVIDIA at these levels, especially with the market hovering near historic highs. So for investors who like NVIDIA's growth story but don't like its premium valuation, here are two alternative plays to consider -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
NVIDIA's Roborace car. Image source: NVIDIA.
AMD is NVIDIA's main rival in discrete GPUs. According to research firm JPR, AMD controlled 29.5% of the market at the end of 2016, compared to NVIDIA's 70.5% share. AMD generally sells cheaper GPUs than NVIDIA, which helped it carve out a loyal niche among budget PC gamers. 
AMD has been aggressively striking back at NVIDIA in GPUs and Intel in CPUs with new products. On the GPU front, it launched new low-end VR-ready GPUs with its Polaris chipset to challenge NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal cards last year. It also plans to launch a preemptive strike against NVIDIA's next-gen Volta cards with its Vega-based cards later this year. 
AMD's RX480 GPU. Image source: AMD.
In CPUs, AMD is challenging Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors with its new Ryzen chips -- which reportedly offer comparable performance as Intel's top-tier eight-core chips at about half the price. These fresh catalysts could significantly strengthen its computing and graphics business over the next few quarters. 
AMD also dominates modern gaming consoles by supplying custom SoCs for the PS4 and Xbox One, which have since become a pillar of growth for its EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) unit.
Analysts expect these tailwinds to lift AMD's revenue by 13% this year, while its non-GAAP earnings -- which have remained in the red for two straight years -- are expected to bounce back into the black. AMD has rallied 180% over the past 12 months on that optimism, but it still isn't that expensive at 2.1 times sales, which is much lower than the industry average price-to-sales ratio of 4 for semiconductor makers.
Qualcomm's 8% gain over the past 12 months looks paltry relative to NVIDIA's and AMD's gains, but that's because the mobile chipmaker has been weighed down by a series of ongoing legal battles with regulators and smartphone makers.
Image source: Qualcomm.
Since those battles are mainly centered on the mobile device market, Qualcomm is aggressively expanding into adjacent markets -- like wearables, connected cameras, drones, and connected cars -- to diversify its business. A big part of that push is challenging NVIDIA's rapidly growing business of connected cars.
Last year, Qualcomm launched Snapdragon Automotive chips to counter the growing adoption of NVIDIA's Tegra chips in infotainment and navigation systems in connected cars. Qualcomm will also close its $47 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world, later this year. 
That purchase will give Qualcomm NXP's BlueBox platform for driverless cars, which directly competes against NVIDIA's Drive PX platform. Since NXP sells a large variety of other automotive chips, Qualcomm will likely employ bundling strategies to gain market share against NVIDIA in the automotive market, which might make the former a better long-term play on connected cars than the latter.
Qualcomm's legal troubles won't end anytime soon, but the NXP deal could transform its business model into a more balanced one, instead of one that relies heavily on a high-margin licensing business propping up a lower-margin one that makes mobile chipsets. 
Analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and earnings (excluding the NXP deal) to dip 3% and 4%, respectively, this year. That sounds dismal, but the stock's price to earnings of 20 remains lower than the industry average of 26 for semiconductor makers, and its forward dividend yield of 3.9% is much higher than S&P 500's current yield of 2%.
I doubt NVIDIA will lose its footing anytime soon, thanks to its market-leading positions in GPUs and automotive CPUs. However, the stock could certainly stagnate as investors fret over its valuations. 
So, in the meantime, investors should keep AMD and Qualcomm in mind as alternative plays on GPUs and connected cars. There's no guarantee that either stock will outperform NVIDIA this year, but they could be lifted by the same rising tides that are boosting NVIDIA's growth.

            ","Investors can be an optimistic bunch, pushing a stock's valuation to a level that assumes the best-case scenario is all but assured. This can work out fine if everything goes right, but any speed bump can lead to disaster.
Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), Wayfair (NYSE:W), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) all trade at lofty, optimistic valuations. Investors are betting that all three companies will grow swiftly, eventually justifying those valuations with future profits. Possible? Sure. Likely? Read on to find out.
After partially recovering from a thumping following a disastrous first-quarter report, Snap Inc. is worth nearly $24 billion. What do you get for that price?
Image source: Snap Inc.
Snap is priced like it's the next Facebook, but it looks far more likely to be the next Twitter. Twitter once sported a bonkers valuation, as well, with its market capitalization topping out well above $30 billion. Slowing user growth and massive, persistent losses eventually put an end to that optimism: Twitter stock is down 75% from its all-time high.
Snap needs to re-accelerate growth and start moving toward profitability. I have no confidence that it can do either of those things, let alone both simultaneously. The Snapchat app has a narrow appeal, and it lacks the inherent usefulness of Facebook and Twitter. It would take a miracle for Snap to ever live up to its outrageous valuation.
Shares of online furniture retailer Wayfair recently exploded higher after the company beat analyst estimates during the first quarter, carving out a new all-time high. The number of active customers surged 46% year over year, driving a 29% increase in revenue. Repeat customers accounted for about 60% of all orders.
Another thing that grew quickly: Wayfair's losses. The company posted an operating loss of $56.2 million, worse than a loss of $40.9 million during the prior-year period. Advertising expenses ate up 12.3% of revenue and 50% of gross profit, despite all those repeat customers. Free cash flow was a loss of $69 million.
Wayfair's plan is to eventually bring down advertising costs as a percentage of revenue, something that will require the company to gain more scale. The long-term goal is to spend just 6%-8% of revenue on advertising. That will be tough given the competitiveness of online retail. Wayfair has Amazon.com -- which is currently making a big push into furniture -- to worry about, as well as traditional retailers that are aiming to grow their e-commerce businesses.
A lot of things need to go right for Wayfair to reach profitability and justify its current valuation. A bet on Wayfair is, in a sense, a bet against Amazon's furniture ambitions. Good luck with that.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) quadrupled in 2016, driven higher by optimism surrounding the company's product launches. AMD has already launched some of its Ryzen PC CPUs, and its EPYC server CPUs and Vega high-end GPUs are coming soon.
There's a bit of a problem, though. AMD is aiming to earn at least $0.75 in per-share adjusted earnings by 2020, and the stock already trades for nearly 15 times that number. The valuation was even higher a few months ago -- AMD stock has declined by about 28% from its 2017 peak, driven by lackluster guidance and a rumor about a possible licensing deal with Intel being debunked. Even after the decline, the market is pricing in something close to the best-case scenario.
AMD is starting from way behind in every market it's targeting, so the company will pick up at least some market share. But Intel and NVIDIA are going to react, with new products, price cuts, or both. Neither will willingly cede share to AMD, especially in the lucrative high-end CPU and GPU markets.
AMD stock is priced like the company is going to return to its former glory. Anything short of that will be a disaster for the stock.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) hasn't launched a truly high-end graphics card since the Fury X nearly two years ago. The Fury X was the first graphics card to include high-bandwidth memory, which increased the rate at which the GPU could access data. This is particularly important for gaming at 4K resolutions.
The Fury X mostly closed the performance gap with NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) high-end graphics cards, but that's all it did. Instead of leapfrogging NVIDIA, as AMD had done in the past, the best it could do was play catch-up with the market leader. NVIDIA's high-end dominance remained intact.
AMD has focused on the mainstream portion of the graphics card market since then, launching its Polaris GPUs about a year ago. These proved a bit more disruptive, as AMD priced the cards aggressively. But NVIDIA quickly countered with new mainstream graphics cards of its own, including the GTX 1060. AMD managed to boost its GPU unit market share to 28% in 2016, up from just 20% in 2015, thanks to Polaris. But that's still well below the roughly 40% share the company enjoyed prior to 2014.
With the Fury X nearly two years old, AMD has essentially no presence in the high-end GPU market. That will change with Vega. The first Vega card, the Frontier Edition, will be aimed at professional applications, not gaming, and will be available in late June. Gaming variants of Vega will launch later this year, but AMD has been coy about release dates.
AMD's computing and graphics segment is still not profitable, even with Polaris producing market-share gains. But Vega has the potential to finally return AMD's core business to profitability.
An unfortunate truth about AMD's mainstream-focused strategy is that mainstream graphics cards aren't all that profitable. According the company's internal estimates, more than 85% of all graphics cards sold are priced lower than $200. In terms of winning unit market share, going after the mainstream portion of the market makes sense.
But just one-third of the total gross margin dollars in the graphics card market is spread across those mainstream units. The other two-thirds is generated by the high end of the market, which accounts for less than 15% of the total unit volume. With NVIDIA dominating the high end over the past few years, it's no wonder that its bottom line has soared.

With AMD starting from nearly zero in the high-end graphics card market, any market-share gains will boost the bottom line. The stock has nearly tripled over the past year, so investors have lofty expectations. Vega can be a success and still fall short of those expectations. While Vega is all upside for AMD, investors need it to be home run.
One major risk: The longer AMD takes to launch the gaming version of Vega, the less time it will have before NVIDIA begins launching its next-gen Volta gaming products. NVIDIA has already announced the Tesla V100, a data center GPU powered by Volta, and there are some rumors suggesting that Volta-based gaming cards could be coming this year. If Vega launches late enough to allow Volta to steal its thunder, AMD may continue to have little presence in the lucrative high end of the market.
Whether Vega will be good enough compared to NVIDIA's current high-end products to win AMD a meaningful amount of high-end market share remains to be seen. AMD's last attempt at breaching the high end fell short, leaving NVIDIA with the lion's share of the most profitable part of the graphics card market. If Vega doesn't live up to the hype, investors betting on an AMD turnaround will be in for a rude awakening.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) recent stock run-up came to an end after its shares dropped almost 25% following the release of the company's first-quarter earnings report on May 1. What's surprising is that AMD stock collapsed so spectacularly even though its results were roughly in line with analyst estimates and its second-quarter revenue guidance bested Wall Street expectations. This is an opportunity for savvy investors.
Investors were possibly expecting better results and guidance from AMD than it delivered due to the Ryzen CPU launch last quarter and the Vega graphics processing unit (GPU) and the Naples server chip coming in the current quarter. Additionally, a gross margin forecast of 33%, as compared to the first quarter's 34%, raised concerns about the profitability of the company's new products.
Image source: AMD. 
However, the sell-off seems overdone, as AMD's performance didn't deviate much from expectations. Of course, it could be that the results and the accompanying guidance weren't exciting enough given the stock's tremendous run over the past year, but the first quarter of the year is a seasonally weak one and the guidance wasn't that disappointing. In fact, the margin guidance was lower because of an accounting change that led to the inclusion of certain manufacturing costs in the cost of goods sold. 
Additionally, investors shouldn't overlook the fact that AMD's gross margin in the first quarter jumped 2 percentage points from last year thanks to the launch of the new Ryzen processors. What's more, it will experience 2-percentage-point year-over-year gross margin growth in the current quarter if it hits the guidance.
Bears argue that AMD shares are priced for perfection. Goldman Sachs analysts, for example, believe that rising operating costs will weigh on its bottom line. But AMD has been ramping up its operating expenses thanks to higher research and development spending in its GPU and server businesses and these expenses should start bearing fruit later this year once its Vega GPUs and Naples server chips hit the market as AMD tries to take the game to NVIDIA and Intel with its latest products. AMD claims that the Naples architecture can perform significantly faster than Intel's top-of-the-line two-socket Xeon chip, thanks to more cores and higher bandwidth memory.
If independent tests corroborate AMD's claims, then Intel will have a tough time defending its near-monopoly in the server market. Demand for high-performance server chips is going to take off, thanks to an increase in cloud workloads.
Meanwhile, rumors indicate that AMD will launch its Vega GPUs before the end of June, challenging NVIDIA's dominance in the space with a product that could match the performance of the latter's latest GTX 1080Ti GPU. More importantly, AMD could try to undercut NVIDIA on pricing in a bid to win more market share.
In my opinion, investors shouldn't hit the sell button. AMD's results weren't that bad, and the company's margins are improving from the prior-year period. In fact, a good number of analysts still believe that AMD's earnings will take off both this year and the next.
For instance, in the past three months, earnings estimates for AMD for fiscal year 2017 have jumped from $0.06 per share to $0.08 per share. Moreover, its earnings are expected to jump to $0.31 per share in fiscal year 2018, up from the $0.28 per share estimate 90 days ago. This isn't surprising, as AMD has substantially improved its business in recent quarters with market-share gains, and it could keep up the momentum once its new products are rolled out.

            ","Any technology investor who has followed the semiconductor industry even remotely closely will know that there can be a lot of volatility because of product cycles. But you wouldn't know it by looking at Cypress Semiconductor's (NASDAQ:CY) and Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) stock prices. Cypress' share price is up more than 40% over the past 12 months and AMD's price has skyrocketed a staggering 200% -- and both increases have easily beat the market's gain of 15%.
But past performance, of course, isn't an indicator of future gains. So let's take a peek at how these companies are growing and what advantage (if any) they have in their respective markets, to see which may be the better long-term buy.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD has often stood in the shadow of graphics processor rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA holds the majority of the discrete desktop GPU market -- at about 70.5% right now -- and AMD takes up the rest. But AMD has made some solid advances against NVIDIA over the past few years, and its nearly 30% discrete desktop GPU market share is up from just over 20% last year. 
Investors have been pleased with those gains and the fact that AMD continues to be the go-to supplier for Sony's and Microsoft's semi-custom chips for gaming consoles. A recent Morningstar investor note form Abhinav Davuluri said that new design wins from Microsoft for its upcoming console could help AMD's semi-custom segment grow by low double digits over the next several years.
The company recently reported earnings for its 2017 first quarter, in which revenue grew 18% year over year, to $984 million. Most of those gains came from AMD's computing and graphics segment sales, which were up 29% year over year. But it wasn't all good news for the company: Computing and graphics posted a loss of $15 million in the quarter, marking 12 consecutive quarters of losses for that segment. 
And then there's AMD's current valuation. AMD shares are trading at a forward P/E of more than 37 right now, compared to the tech industry average of about 25. The ongoing losses in one of the chipmaker's most important business segments is going to make it difficult for the company to match its current valuation and be a solid long-term play as it stands right now. 

AMD chart by YCharts.
Cypress has a broad semiconductor business that encompasses everything from memory chips to automotive instrument cluster processors to Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. Cypress' position in the embedded-chips space is strong and its most recent quarterly earnings showed the company's slow yet steady growth.
Total sales grew by 26.9% year over year, to $531.9 million. Automotive sales ticked up 6% sequentially, and wireless connectivity jumped 30% from the previous quarter. Cypress also posted a net income loss of $45.8 million in the quarter, but on a non-GAAP basis (taking out stock-based compensation and acquisition costs) net income increased nearly 100%, to $45.9 million. 
Cypress stock is trading at just 13 times its forward earnings, far below the tech average of 25. Investors looking for a strong bet on embedded semiconductors would be smart to give Cypress consideration. The company has its hands in multiple areas of embedded systems and wireless connectivity, which gives it lots of opportunities as enterprise customers are projected to spend $1.29 trillion on the Internet of Things by 2020.  

CY chart by YCharts.
I like AMD's growth and strong position in the graphics processor space, but I think the company may be overvalued right now as investors have pushed up its share price faster than it can offset losses in one of its core segments. Meanwhile, Cypress is dealing with its own net losses, but continues to grow revenues across key businesses, has acquired companies to expand its semiconductor footprint, and trades at a much lower valuation. Thus, I think Cypress is a better pick over AMD right now.

            ","It all started last December. Kyle Bennett, chief editor of tech website HardOCP, penned a forum post claiming that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had signed a deal with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to license its Radeon graphics technology. The post suggested that Intel was aiming to use AMD's GPUs in its own products, an idea that seemed far-fetched.
But Intel licensing AMD's graphics-related patents was plausible. Intel signed a cross-licensing deal with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2011 as a result of a lawsuit, paying the graphics chip specialist $1.5 billion over six years for access to its patents. The last of that revenue has now been recognized, and with no sign that the agreement has been renewed, the AMD rumor was able to take off.
That rumor reemerged on Tuesday when another tech website, Fudzilla, claimed that the Intel-AMD licensing pact was a done deal, without citing any sources. AMD stock surged as investors took that claim as fact, undoing some of the damage that followed the company's lackluster first-quarter report.
Image source: AMD.
AMD's analyst day event was held Tuesday evening, and investors were expecting the company to confirm the deal. It didn't, and the stock tumbled. Intel later refuted the rumors outright, with a company spokesperson telling CNBC that the ""recent rumors that Intel has licensed AMD's graphics technology are untrue.""
Based on all of this, I would wager that the deal was nothing more than a rumor. And looking at the original agreement between Intel and NVIDIA, it's clear that Intel probably has no need for AMD's intellectual property.
The 2011 cross-licensing deal between Intel and NVIDIA ""expired"" early this year, in the sense that NVIDIA is no longer recognizing revenue from Intel. The last payment occurred in January 2016, with NVIDIA recognizing that revenue throughout the fiscal year. The deal gave Intel a nonexclusive, nontransferable worldwide license to all patents owned or controlled by NVIDIA that have a filing date on or before March 31, 2017.
While the payments have now stopped, Intel hasn't lost the license to those patents. The key clause in the agreement: ""The term of the patent cross license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated."" In other words, Intel's access to NVIDIA's patents filed prior to March 31 of this year will persist until all of them have expired, presumably decades from now.
What this means: Intel probably doesn't need to license anything from AMD. The deal is almost certainly nothing more than a rumor. AMD's refusal to comment and Intel's refutation make it hard to believe that any deal is in the works.
The ups and downs of the stock in reaction to the Intel rumor tells me that quite a few investors were duped by what has turned out to be mere speculation. Buying a stock based on rumors is a recipe for disaster, especially if those rumors come without sources from tech websites with questionable reliability.
Based on the original Intel-NVIDIA agreement, there seems to be no reason for Intel to require AMD's intellectual property. AMD may be able to sign deals with other companies and extract high-margin royalty income, but the odds of an Intel deal look vanishingly small. Some rumors turn out to be true, but the Intel-AMD deal isn't one of them.

            ","Stocks had their worst day of the year so far on Wednesday, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all declining sharply from their recent advances. The Nasdaq Composite had risen the furthest and therefore had the most ground to lose, closing the day with a 2.5% loss, but the Dow and S&P 500 weren't far behind with drops of almost 2%. Fears about growing controversy concerning President Trump and investigations of members of his administration finally led to significant selling pressure from traders, and market participants are now betting that many of the initiatives that the new president had proposed might not happen.
In addition, some company-specific news pushed stocks lower, and American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO), CoreCivic (NYSE:CXW), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Shares of American Eagle Outfitters dropped 15% in the wake of the company's first-quarter financial report. The teen retailer managed to boost comparable sales by 2%, but adjusted operating income was down by more than a quarter from the year-ago period. More disconcerting was the fact that American Eagle now projects that its second-quarter results won't be as strong as investors had hoped, and restructuring plans will likely accelerate and include the closing of 25 to 40 store locations during the full year. In the long run, the retailer is hopeful that its actions will help to return American Eagle to a growth trajectory. But after today's report, it looks like any rebound won't come nearly as quickly as many had hoped.

CoreCivic stock dropped 10% after the political fallout hit the private prison services company hard. The stock had seen gains of more than 70% after the November election, with many seeing the potential for expanded use of privately run detention facilities under the Trump administration. However, the company formerly known as Corrections Corp. of America could face more difficulties if Washington gridlock worsens during the current controversy. If things blow over for the White House, then the drop in shares of CoreCivic and peers in the private prison industry could well look like an overreaction in the long run. Yet if the crisis doesn't end favorably, then CoreCivic could have more room to drop, as its stock is still up by half since November.
Finally, shares of Advanced Micro Devices gave up 12%. The chipmaker said in its much-anticipated investor day presentation that it would focus more on high-end products, looking to discard its reputation as a secondary player to industry giants with greater market share in their respective product niches. The Ryzen line of core processing units is already out, and AMD will release more chips later this year, including the Vega graphics processing unit and the EPYC server processor. Yet shareholders seemed unimpressed by guidance for revenue growth that barely broke into double-digit percentages, and even though longer-term calls for gains in margin are encouraging, they apparently didn't justify the gains the shares had already seen recently.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) held its annual Financial Analyst Day event on May 16, providing an update on its strategy and its long-term financial targets. AMD expects to return to profitability this year, at least on a non-GAAP basis, along with double-digit revenue growth and gross margin expansion. It expects those trends to continue through 2020, producing non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.75 in that year.
A shift toward premium products will be a major driver of this growth. AMD has long been known, at least in the CPU market, as being a cheaper alternative to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company wants to shed that reputation. AMD has already launched Ryzen CPUs for desktop PCs, a vast improvement over the company's previous-generation chips, and a slew of other premium products are coming this year.
Image source: AMD.
Of course, Intel won't take kindly to AMD going after its lucrative premium products. Chipzilla will no doubt be launching new products and cutting prices if necessary to beat back AMD, making the company's financial targets no sure thing. AMD will be launching new Vega GPUs and its EPYC server processors later this year as well, but it will be going against similarly entrenched competition in those markets.
AMD expects to grow revenue by a low-double-digit percentage in 2017, a goal that may seem disappointing to investors considering all the new products set to launch this year. AMD is going after high-margin revenue, aiming to boost its non-GAAP gross margin to 34% this year, up from 31% in 2016 and 28% in 2015. By 2020, AMD expects its gross margin to exceed 40%.
Along with boosting the gross margin, AMD expects to bring down operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, mostly by keeping costs in check as revenue grows. The non-GAAP EPS target of $0.75 by 2020 represents about $700 million of non-GAAP net income at the current share count, and it expects to produce at least some non-GAAP net income in 2017.
In the PC market, AMD will be going after the premium segment. According to the company, 79% of revenue in the PC CPU market comes from the premium segment, along with 55% of unit volume. Prior to Ryzen, AMD was concentrated in the mainstream segment and below. With Ryzen, the focus shifts to gaining premium market share.
Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5, the high-end and mainstream lines of Ryzen CPUs, have already launched for desktop PCs, with the lower-end Ryzen 3 coming later this year. The key feature of Ryzen is the number of cores; the higher-end models have eight cores, double the number found in most Intel processors. Major PC original equipment manufacturers like HP and Dell are expected to launch Ryzen systems during the second quarter, boosting the total addressable market.
The mobile version of Ryzen will be coming during the second half, featuring graphics based on the company's Vega GPU. The focus again will be on performance, with AMD promising big increases in CPU and GPU performance. AMD is also launching Ryzen Pro, aimed at the commercial market, during the second half. The headline product will be Threadripper, AMD's 16-core high-end desktop processor set to launch during the summer.
Image source: AMD.
Ryzen has so far received mixed reviews, mainly because AMD remains behind Intel in terms of single-threaded performance. Gaming performance has been particularly disappointing; Ryzen CPUs are certainly capable gaming chips, but the single-threaded performance deficit can't be offset with more cores in applications that don't scale well.
Intel won't be sitting on its hands as AMD goes after the most profitable portion of the PC CPU market. There are rumors that the company plans to launch a new line of Core i9 processors featuring up to 12 cores to combat AMD, and it certainly has room to adjust its prices if necessary. With AMD focusing on boosting its margins, it won't have that much room to undercut Intel on price.
Investors betting that AMD will hit its long-term goals should know that the stock already trades for 16 times the 2020 EPS target. The market is assuming AMD will succeed, a perilous situation for investors if the company falls short. Ryzen puts AMD in a much-improved competitive position compared to a few years ago, and both Vega and EPYC have a lot of potential. But it will still be a battle to pry away premium market share from Intel.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) dropped on Wednesday in reaction to the company's Analyst Day event Tuesday afternoon. While AMD revealed new information about upcoming products and laid out long-term financial targets, investors were left underwhelmed. The stock declined as much as 9.7% Wednesday morning, settling into an 9.25% loss by 11:45 a.m. EDT.
AMD laid out its plan to return to profitability. The company expects to grow revenue by a low double-digit percentage in 2017, with the bottom line boosted by a rising gross margin. Positive non-GAAP net income is expected, although AMD didn't provide a specific target.
AMD expects to continue to grow revenue by a double-digit percentage annually through 2020, with gross margin rising above 40% and non-GAAP EPS reaching $0.75. A focus on premium products with high margins will be the driver behind the growth.
Image source: AMD.
In terms of products, AMD announced that Ryzen Mobile and the commercial orientated Ryzen Pro will be launching in the second half, and the 16-core Threadripper desktop CPU will be available in the summer. AMD also announced the first product built around its high-end Vega GPU, the Radeon Vega Frontier Edition, which targets professional applications. EPYC, AMD's upcoming server processors previously codenamed Naples, will launch in June.
There are two things that could be responsible for driving down AMD's stock price on Wednesday. First, the stock already traded for 17 times what the company hopes to earn in 2020 going into Wednesday, a valuation investors may be realizing is too optimistic. Second, AMD failed to confirm a rumor that emerged on Tuesday that it had struck a graphics licensing deal with Intel. The lack of confirmation could mean that it's still nothing more than a rumor.
AMD is targeting the premium segment of both the PC CPU and GPU markets, where it will face stiff competition from Intel and NVIDIA. In the server CPU market, it will need to show its customers that its EPYC CPUs offer a clear value proposition compared to Intel's offerings. If any part of that plan gets derailed, AMD will miss its long-term targets, which are already baked into the stock price.
The slump on Wednesday is another instance of investors realizing that the optimism surrounding AMD was overdone. The stock nearly quadrupled in 2016, but it took a hit after a lackluster first-quarter report, and it's taking another hit after the long-term outlook simply wasn't enough to justify the stock price.
AMD may outperform its targets, with its new products performing better than expected. But the company has a history of over-promising and under-delivering, so I wouldn't bet on it.

            ","The stock market was mixed on Tuesday, continuing a recent streak of relatively calm trading even as major benchmarks remain at or near all-time highs. Some market participants continue to point to turmoil in Washington and uncertainty about the future direction of the U.S. economy in keeping stocks from climbing more aggressively, but there have also been some favorable events that have kept the market from correcting. In addition, positive news from individual stocks has helped sentiment, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices climbed over 11%, regaining most of the ground they lost after a lackluster earnings report earlier this month. AMD will be holding its analyst day presentation after the market closes Tuesday afternoon, but investors are already trying to speculate what the chipmaker might tell its shareholders. One report suggested once again that AMD rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) might have chosen to license AMD graphics chips rather than renewing a deal with AMD's primary competitor in the graphics space. With the stock already having seen a huge run higher in the past year, AMD needs to make good on all of its potential in order to satisfy many of its investors.
Image source: AMD.
Weibo stock soared 25% after the Chinese social-media company reported its first-quarter results. The microblogging specialist saw a nice jump in key metrics like monthly active and daily active users, and that helped to send revenue soaring by two-thirds. Adjusted net income jumped almost fourfold, showing the fast pace of growth the company has achieved. Moreover, Weibo said that it expects second-quarter revenue figures to come in relatively strong compared to what most of those following the stock had expected. Given the struggles that Weibo's U.S. microblogging counterpart has had in generating growth, the Chinese company's success could pose a lesson for others to follow in coming up with a good business strategy in the social media space.
Finally, shares of Etsy were up 21%. Investors found out that two major institutional investors, TPG Group Holdings and Dragoneer Investment Group, have taken stakes in the online crafts marketplace. With interest among known activist investors, rank-and-file shareholders figure that the odds are better that Etsy will explore various strategic alternatives to unlock investor value, which often involves looking at a potential sale of a company. Given the desire for activist investors to help their targets achieve such ends, the company will face plenty of pressure to come up with a strategy to satisfy them while still remaining true to its own mission. Because of the difficult times that Etsy has faced lately, however, it'll be tough to convince shareholders to maintain the status quo and ignore whatever the company's newest major shareholders suggest going forward.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped on Tuesday after tech website Fudzilla reported that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had licensed AMD's graphics technology, replacing a deal with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) that expired in March. The stock was up about 10% at 2:45 p.m. EDT.
Back in 2011, Intel and NVIDIA reached a six-year cross-licensing deal as the result of a legal dispute between the two companies. Intel agreed to pay NVIDIA $1.5 billion over the course of the deal, providing the graphics chip company with a significant boost to its bottom line. NVIDIA has seen its revenue and profit surge since then, driven by its gaming, enterprise, and automotive businesses, making the annual payment less important to the bottom line.
Image source: AMD.
Rumors of an Intel-AMD deal first surfaced in December, emerging from a different tech website. With neither company confirming the deal, it remains a rumor. If a deal has been reached, it's unclear whether a similar amount of money would be involved, given that the NVIDIA deal was the result of a lawsuit. Regardless, any licensing payments coming AMD's way will help the company return to profitability.
Intel would be licensing AMD's graphics-related intellectual property, allowing it to include integrated graphics in its CPUs without violating patents. It's highly unlikely that Intel would reach a deal to include AMD's GPUs in its products, as the original rumor seemed to suggest.
Even if the amount of money is small, it should flow through to the bottom line for AMD. The company posted an adjusted loss of $117 million last year, so a new source of high-margin licensing revenue coupled with revenue from new product launches could make 2017 the year that AMD returns to the black. Investors shouldn't get too excited, though, until either AMD or Intel confirms the deal directly.

            ","Virtual reality could prove to be the next growth driver for the PC market and for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). TechNavio estimates that PCs accounted for 43% of the VR content market in 2015, valued at roughly $95 million in 2015 and estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 127% by 2020.
This could be a big deal for the industry, but in order to create more VR content, PCs will need better hardware.
This is where Intel comes in with its eighth-generation central processing units (CPUs), though it's not the only one eyeing this opportunity. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also pulling out all stops to capitalize on the VR boom.
Intel recently threw some light on its upcoming eighth-generation processors, which are expected to be launched later in the year. The company expects the new processors to deliver performance gains of at least 15% over the previous generation.
Fellow Fool contributor Ashraf Eassa tweeted in Febuary that he had confirmed with Intel that the eighth-generation CPU will be based on the 14-nanometer fabrication technology, as compared with the rumored 10nm technology. But, will a 15% bump in performance be enough to satisfy the needs of the power-hungry workstations that create VR content?
It's still early days and PCs don't need a huge amount of power to create VR content. In fact, Intel has already launched more powerful versions of its i7 processors that are tailored to address VR content creation. In May last year it launched an Extreme Edition Core i7 Broadwell-E processor to target VR content-creation professionals based on the 14nm process. Intel claimed at that time that this chip was 35% faster at 3D rendering for ultra-high-definition (commonly known as 4K) videos as compared with the previous generation chip.
This gives Intel a leg up in this market as VR content requires video rendering in at least 4K resolution in most cases as the video is stretched 180 degrees vertically and 360 degrees horizontally to provide an immersive experience. A lower resolution doesn't provide a good VR experience because it leads to video pixelization.
Not surprisingly, Intel's chips are rated highly when it comes to building high-end PCs for video rendering given the already powerful processors that it has on the market. Therefore, a power bump in Intel's next-gen CPUs should help it extend its lead in this market, though one of its rivals is trying to catching up with its offerings.

Can AMD crash Intel's party?
AMD intends to leapfrog Intel in terms of performance with its Ryzen architecture that was unveiled at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in January. A Forbes article indicates that AMD's Ryzen 5 1600X CPU is reportedly performing better than the Intel Core i7-6850K in a benchmark test, while consuming less power.
More importantly, the Core i7-6850K sells for around $610, while AMD's Ryzen 5 1600X is expected to sell for just $259. AMD could give Intel trouble by offering a better performance at a lower price.
The launch of Intel's seventh-gen i7-7700K processor should tilt the balance in its favor, though, as it will sell for $350 at most and could trump AMD's offering in some areas. The Intel processor, for instance, will reportedly consume 91 watts of power, as compared with Ryzen's estimated 95 watts. It also has a higher maximum turbo frequency of up to 4.5 GHz, compared with Ryzen 5 1600X's 3.7GHz, which gives Intel the upper hand in the key single-thread benchmark test.
A higher turbo frequency means that users can ""overclock"" the processor. In simpler terms, content creators can extract more power out of the processor by bumping up the power to the specified limit in case they need more juice. Evidently, Intel's chip can achieve a higher speed as compared to AMD's Ryzen, making it the CPU of choice for high-end systems in search of more power, possibly translating into more sales. 
Therefore, when Intel releases its next-gen processors later this year, it can get into a stronger position as compared with AMD's Ryzen. So the incremental improvements in Intel's processors could help it stay ahead of AMD in performance terms and help it gain a stronger foothold in the VR PC hardware market.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) dropped 11% after hours on May 1 after the chipmaker posted first quarter numbers which merely met analyst expectations. Revenue rose 18% annually to $984 million, and non-GAAP net loss narrowed from $0.12 a year ago to $0.04 per share. 
Those were solid numbers, but merely matching estimates didn't seem enough to justify a further rally for the stock, which already rallied about 280% over the past 12 months. But does AMD's post-earnings dip represent a buying opportunity for investors who had been waiting for a pullback? Let's examine AMD's key growth opportunities to find out.
Image source: AMD.
AMD's most exciting new product line is Ryzen, a new series of x86 chips which are squarely aimed at Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) current-gen Kaby Lake processors. AMD's initial benchmarks show that AMD's top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X matches the 8-core Intel Core i7-6900K in single-threaded performance, and beats it by 9% in multi-threaded performance -- for just half the price. 
Since recent reports from top PC makers indicate that PC sales are finally warming up after a multi-year slump, AMD's launch of the Ryzen in early March could coincide with a lot of desktop upgrades. This could give AMD a huge advantage over Intel over the next few months, since Intel's comparable Coffee Lake and next-gen Cannonlake chips aren't expected to arrive until the end of the year. AMD even plans to challenge Intel in the data center market with Naples, a high-end Zen processor which has more cores and memory channels than Intel's comparable Purley CPU.
AMD's first quarter included less than a month of Ryzen sales, but CEO Lisa Su noted that those initial numbers contributed to the Computing and Graphics segment's 29% year-over-year sales growth to $593 million. 
AMD's RX 480. Image source: AMD.
That business was also boosted by robust sales of its new Radeon desktop GPUs, which are intended to counter NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) new lineup of GeForce cards. 
AMD's market share of the add-in board market rose from 21.6% to 29.5% between the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2016, according to JPR. During that period, NVIDIA's share dropped from 78.3% to 70.5%.
However, weaker sales of mobile CPUs and GPUs caused AMD's Computing and Graphics revenue to dip 1% sequentially. On the bright side, AMD's client average selling price (ASP) rose both sequentially and annually, fueled by higher ASPs for its newer desktop processors and GPUs. That price growth, along with lower expenses, narrowed the unit's operating loss from $70 million a year ago to $15 million. 
AMD's Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) revenue rose 5% annually to $391 million, thanks to consistent sales of semi-custom SoCs for gaming consoles. Sales still dropped 23% sequentially due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs, but the recent refreshes of the PS4 and Xbox One could help sales rebound later this year. However, the EESC unit's operating income declined 81% annually to $9 million -- due to higher server related R&D investments being partly offset by licensing revenues from its THATIC joint venture in China.
The next big catalyst for AMD will be its next-gen GPU Vega, which will launch this quarter in an attempt to pull ahead of NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal cards. NVIDIA is expected to counter Vega with its next-gen Volta chipset next year, but there's a strong chance that the Vega can win over upgrading desktop users before Volta arrives.
However, AMD also faces two wild cards which could help or harm its business. First, persistent rumors indicate that Intel could sign a graphics licensing deal with AMD, since its previous deal with NVIDIA recently expired. If Intel agrees to pay AMD an amount comparable to the $66 million in licensing revenues it paid NVIDIA every quarter, it could give AMD's top line a nice long-term boost. 
Meanwhile, NVIDIA recently reentered the gaming console market by supplying its Tegra SoC for Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) new Switch console. This unexpected development indicates that AMD's long-term dominance of the console market might not be guaranteed. 
AMD expects its second quarter revenue to rise 12% annually and about 17% sequentially at the midpoint, as sales of Ryzen and Vega chips take off. By the end of the year, higher console sales during the holiday season could significantly lift its EESC revenues. 
Wall Street expects these catalysts to boost AMD's revenue by 11% this year and 10% next year. AMD's price-to-sales ratio of 2.6 is still lower than its industry average of 3.9, so the stock still doesn't look overpriced after its year-long rally. AMD is expected to return to non-GAAP profitability with earnings of $0.08 per share this year and $0.30 per share next year. 
Based on these facts, investors who believe that Ryzen and Vega can respectively counter competition from Intel and NVIDIA should view the pullback as a buying opportunity -- as long as they realize that their success still remains highly speculative.

            ","Wall Street and investors are always looking toward the future. But, the question that has to be asked from time to time is whether Wall Street and investors have looked too far into the future and overvalued a company relative to its hype. 
With this in mind, we asked three of our Foolish contributors to dissect an a highly hyped stock to uncover whether it'll be able to live up to the hoopla that surrounds it. Find out if rare-disease drugmaker Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT), luxury sports-car manufacturer Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), can live up to their hype. 
Image source: Getty Images.
Sean Williams (Sarepta Therapeutics): One biotech company that's been potentially overhyped for years is Sarepta Therapeutics, a drug developer aimed at tackling Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a degenerative muscle disease that attacks children, teens, and young adults.
Sarepta's back and forth with the Food and Drug Administration was the stuff you find on daytime soap operas. On one hand, its phase 2b extension study involving Exondys 51 (which is now a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for exon 51-skipping DMD) demonstrated a clear benefit via the six-minute walk test (6MWT) over the placebo. On the other hand, the FDA had a hard time making the connection that an increase in dystrophin production and the positive 6MWT benefits were the result of Exondys 51. Eventually, the FDA conceded and approved Exondys 51 with the condition that Sarepta run a phase 3 confirmation study.
Now the big question? Can Sarepta live up to the hype surrounding its DMD drug(s)? I believe it can.
Initial sales, post-launch, of Exondys 51 have been better than expected. The company's first-quarter report featured $16.3 million in revenue, which was $2.5 million more than Wall Street expected, and the company lifted its full-year outlook to at least $95 million in sales. Previously, Sarepta had estimated that it would generate in excess of $80 million in sales for 2017. As the lone DMD product for the exon 51 mutation, and bearing the orphan drug designation that affords exceptional pricing power, Exondys 51 is well on its way to meeting or beating expectations.
Image source: Getty Images.
But, there's more. Recently, Sarepta provided positive long-term cardiac and pulmonary data on Exondys 51 at the MDA Scientific Conference, and it announced that nearly four in five insurance plans is now covering its only approved drug. With coverage becoming less of an issue and safety concerns firmly in the rearview mirror, Exonyds 51 can shine. 
There's also the extrapolation that if Exondys 51 was successful, the company's other developing therapeutics that target about half of the DMD population will succeed, too.
It's possible that Sarepta could be profitable on a recurring basis by 2019 or 2020, and assuming its other DMD programs meet their primary endpoint, Sarepta could easily surpass the hype surrounding its stock.
Daniel Miller (Ferrari): Investors and Wall Street have been reluctant to buy into the automotive industry at a time when the U.S. sales cycle is plateauing, and that's understandable to some degree. One company that has been hyped up anyway over the past year is Ferrari, but it might not live up to expectations in the long-term. Over the past twelve months shares of Ferrari have raced 70% higher, much higher than Fiat Chrysler's 33% gain or even Tesla's 30% gain.
There are certainly reasons to be bullish on Ferrari, as it's a unique play within the capital-intensive automotive industry. It has less price volatility as its revenue and sales aren't nearly as negatively impacted as mainstream automakers. Ferrari has gross margins nearing 50% and EBITDA margins above 25%, which are incredible compared to the industry norm. Also, it probably goes unsaid, but Ferrari is certainly a powerful and recognizable global brand with heritage from Formula One racing. 
LaFerrari Aperta Hypercar. Image source: Ferrari N.V.
All of those bullish factors have pushed Ferrari to a trailing twelve month price-to-earnings ratio of 33. The problem with paying such a rich valuation for the hyped up Ferrari is long-term growth might go against the company's tradition of remaining an exclusive brand -- it's a fact that Ferrari doesn't want to sell too many cars. Maybe Ferrari can indeed find the right balance between sustainably growing its sales without deteriorating its pricing power and exclusivity, but that limits the company's upside. And a company with limited upside makes it difficult to buy the hype and jump in with its current price-to-earnings ratio.
Anders Bylund (Advanced Micro Devices): Few companies entered this earnings season with more buzz than Advanced Micro Devices. The designer of PC-compatible processors and specialized graphics chips released brand new chip architectures in both categories last year. The new products were quickly embraced by enthusiasts and reviewers, driving a much needed surge of revenue growth.
Inspired by the successful introduction of AMD's Polaris graphics and Zen CPU lines, share prices nearly quadrupled in 16 months and soared to nine-year highs. As always, AMD is one of the most talked-about stocks in public forums. Glory days like the original Athlon era must be right around the corner.

AMD data by YCharts
Or maybe not.
When AMD reported first-quarter results at the start of May, the results were in line with analyst projections. But guidance for the next quarter pointed to the slowest revenue growth AMD has seen since the spring of 2016, raising doubts about the sustainability of growth powered by Polaris and Ryzen. And the next day, share prices plunged 22% lower.
The second quarter should be an easy layup for AMD, since the year-ago period contained no sales at all of the Ryzen and Polaris chips. Growth slowdowns will come when AMD's quarters start lapping the release of new products, making year-over-year comparisons tougher. But that would be the third quarter, not the second.
Something's amiss here, and AMD richly deserved that guidance-based sell-off. I'm not buying the AMD hype here.

            ","Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell more than 3% on April 28 after the chipmaker posted a mixed first quarter earnings report. Revenue rose 7% annually to $14.79 billion, narrowly missing expectations by about $20 million. Earnings grew 22% to $0.66 per share, beating estimates by a penny.
Those headline numbers weren't terrible, but several troubling headwinds likely gave the bears enough reasons to bet against the stock, which has stayed flat since the beginning of the year. Let's examine four reasons why the bears could be right about Intel's future.
Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Image source: Intel.
Intel's Client Computing revenue rose 6% annually to $8 billion thanks to rebounding sales of PCs. However, the arrival of AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) next-gen Ryzen chip in early March represents a dangerous new threat to Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors. 
AMD's benchmarks claim that the top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X matches the 8-core Intel Core i7-6900K in terms of single-threaded performance and beats it by 9% in terms of multi-threaded performance -- for half the price. Since the Ryzen is arriving at a time when PC sales are gradually recovering, many desktop owners might upgrade to systems powered by AMD's processors instead of Intel's.
Intel plans to launch its new Coffee Lake processors later this year, but it's unclear if those chips -- built with the same 14nm manufacturing process as Kaby Lake and Ryzen -- can effectively compete against AMD's chips. Intel's next-gen 10nm Cannonlake chips are expected to arrive by the end of 2017, but their actual specs remain sketchy. To top it all off, AMD will soon launch its Naples server processor -- which has more cores and memory channels than Intel's Purley CPU -- to challenge Intel's dominance of the data center market.
AMD isn't the only chipmaker causing headaches for Intel. Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) also recently collaborated with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to make Windows 10 compatible with its top-tier Snapdragon processors, which indicates that more Snapdragon-powered PCs and 2-in-1s could hit the market soon.

Qualcomm also recently launched Centriq 2400, a 64-bit ARM-based processor for servers. Once again, Microsoft lent a helping hand by porting Windows Server to the chip. This development is significant, since the Centriq is a 10nm chip. Intel's 10nm Xeon server chips aren't expected to arrive until next year. 
Unlike older ARM-based server chips, which specialized in niche tasks instead of directly competing against Intel's powerhouse Xeons, Qualcomm believes that the Centriq can go toe-to-toe with Intel's flagship server chips. 
The fresh competition from AMD and Qualcomm cast a spotlight on the worst figure from Intel's first quarter report -- its Data Center revenues rose just 6% annually to $4.2 billion, missing analyst expectations of $4.35 billion. That's also well below the double-digit annual sales growth which the company claimed that it could achieve back in late 2015.
To make matters worse, the Data Center Group's operating margin fell about nine percentage points annually to 35.1% for the quarter, due to increased investments in developing new 10nm manufacturing processes. Intel expects that dip to be temporary, and it expects operating margin for the group to remain between 40%-45% for the year, but that still represents a reduction from its previous forecast of 45%-50%. Those slumping revenues and declining margins could put Intel in a tough spot as AMD, Qualcomm, and others smell blood. 
Intel recently agreed to buy Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), the world's leading maker of ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems), for over $15 billion. That price was painfully steep, since the company generated just $358 million in sales last year.
Intel bought Mobileye because it was clearly falling behind in the connected car market. NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Tegra had established a first-mover's advantage in connected cars, which served as a foundation for launching its Drive PX driverless platform. Qualcomm, meanwhile, will soon become the world's biggest maker of automotive chips after its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) closes.
Intel previously launched Atom Automotive chips for cars, but those chips never gained as much traction as NVIDIA's  or NXP's chips. While it can be argued that Intel needed to buy Mobileye, the all-cash deal will drain its overseas cash (nearly $14 billion at the end of 2016) and greatly reduce its free cash flow ($11.3 billion over the past 12 months). Furthermore, there's no guarantee that buying Mobileye will help Intel counter NVIDIA, which gained Tesla as a Drive PX 2 customer after a fatal crash involving a Mobileye-powered Autopilot platform.
Intel probably won't nosedive in the near future, but it probably also won't rally. The company is seemingly slipping behind the tech curve with the ongoing delays of its ""tick tock"" launch schedule, and it seems ill-prepared to fend off ambitious challengers like AMD and Qualcomm. Therefore, Intel might look like a safe mature tech play with a decent 3% yield, but investors should be wary of the tough headwinds it faces.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soared nearly 300% in 2016 due to nothing but hope. Hope that, after years of losses, a deluge of new products would make AMD competitive in its core markets once again. Hope that, despite intense competition from Intel and NVIDIA, profits would eventually surge to record highs.
AMD stock lost 24% of its value on Tuesday as this euphoric optimism collided with reality. The company's first-quarter report simply matched analyst expectations, with revenue growing but losses persisting. Polaris, AMD's mainstream graphics cards, and Ryzen 7, its high-end CPUs, delivered growth. But the company's guidance for the second quarter left a lot to be desired considering the slate of new products.
The story of AMD's comeback has fueled the stock over the past year. Now it's time for the numbers to prove that story right or wrong.
Image source: AMD.
AMD grew revenue by 18% year over year to $984 million during the first quarter, with its compute and graphics segment producing 29% growth. This was driven by sales of Polaris graphics cards, which didn't launch until the end of the second quarter last year, and Ryzen 7 CPUs, which launched at the beginning of March.
The compute and graphics segment still posted an operating loss of $15 million, but that's a vast improvement over the $70 million loss reported during the first quarter of 2016. Overall, AMD reported a GAAP net loss of $73 million and a non-GAAP net loss of $38 million; both improved compared to the prior-year period.
Ryzen 7 drove AMD's highest desktop processor revenue in more than two years, according to CEO Lisa Su. That's not surprising, given that AMD was woefully outmatched in the PC CPU market prior to Ryzen. The comparison is about as easy as it gets. GPU sales rose by a double-digit percentage, with both the ramp of notebook design wins and improved sales of desktop graphics cards driving the increase.
AMD expects its second-quarter revenue to grow by just 12% year over year. I suspect the steep decline in the stock price following AMD's earnings report was mostly due to this guidance. Here's what the second quarter will contain:
Ryzen 5, AMD's mainstream CPUs, launched at the beginning of April. The first Polaris graphics cards didn't become available until late June of last year, deep into the second quarter. Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end GPU, and Naples, AMD's upcoming server CPU, are expected to launch at some point during the second quarter.
In other words, the second quarter of last year contained essentially none of the above. The comparison should be incredibly easy for AMD. Given all of these new products, 12% growth simply isn't enough. To be fair, Vega and Naples may not contribute much revenue in the second quarter, depending on when they launch and how long they take to ramp up. But even so, if Polaris and most of the Ryzen desktop lineup can only drive 12% growth, it's no wonder the stock fell off a cliff.
There's no question that AMD is more competitive today than it was a few years ago. There's also no question that its revenue will continue to rise in the second half, driven by more product launches. But AMD's comeback won't be easy, and it won't be quick.
The idea that AMD is simply going to waltz in and steal significant market share from Intel and NVIDIA, which drove the explosion in the stock price last year, is optimistic to say the least. AMD is playing catch-up everywhere. Investors betting on the best-case scenario need to adjust their expectations.

As for individual stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Coach (NYSE:TPR) attracted heavy investor interest following their respective quarterly earnings reports.

Advanced Micro Devices stock plunged 24% after the chipmaker posted its fiscal first-quarter operating results. The headline numbers met expectations, with revenue rising to $984 million and non-GAAP loss improving to $0.04 per share compared to $0.12 per share a year ago. ""We achieved 18 percent year-over-year revenue growth driven by strong demand for our high performance Ryzen CPUs as well as graphics processors,"" CEO Lisa Su said in a press release. 
Looking deeper into the figures, gross profit margin rose 2 percentage points to 34% of sales thanks to help from the new tech released. On the other hand, research and development expenses surged higher and cash flow sank due to debt payments and increased inventory.

But what really had Wall Street analysts conflicted was the company's conservative guidance for upcoming quarters. AMD sees sales growth slowing to a 12% pace next quarter despite a range of new products on the market including fresh Ryzen processors and new high-end GPUs. For the full year, the company projected sales gains at roughly that same pace. Plus, profitability is only expected on a non-GAAP basis. Investors were expecting more from a stock that had risen over 240% in the year leading up to Tuesday's report.
Coach shares jumped 11% following solid operating results out of the luxury apparel and accessory specialist. The company managed steady comparable-store sales gains of 3% despite a big increase in selling prices that happened as a result of management's decision to reduce Coach's exposure to department stores.
Image source: Getty Images.
Thus, even though reported earnings declined, gross profitability jumped higher by 190 basis points to 70.9% of sales. Coach also cut expenses, which led to a 13% jump in operating income.
""Our solid performance this quarter was very much in line with our expectations and our strategic initiatives,"" CEO Victor Luis said in a press release. ""[D]espite our deliberate pullback in the North America wholesale channel and the impact of calendar shifts, we delivered earnings growth,"" he continued.
Luis and his team are gaining confidence in their turnaround plan and expect sales to rise in the low-single-digit range this year. Notably, that increase will come as operating margin improves to between 18.5% and 19% of sales -- up sharply from the prior year's 14.5% result.
Ultimately, these trends should produce double-digit growth in net income to over $500 million. That's far from the $1.03 billion the retailer was earning as recently as 2013, but it still marks a decent rebound from its annual profit low, set in 2015, of just $402 million.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) plunged on Tuesday following a first-quarter report that failed to justify the stock's 300% gain last year. AMD matched analyst expectations, but its guidance for the second quarter left a lot to be desired, despite a flurry of new product launches. AMD stock was down 19% at 11:40 a.m. EDT.
AMD reported first-quarter revenue of $984 million and a non-GAAP earnings-per-share loss of $0.04, in line with average analyst estimates. The computing and graphics segment enjoyed a 29% year-over-year revenue increase, buoyed by AMD's mainstream Polaris graphics cards and its high-end Ryzen 7 CPUs. The segment still posted an operating loss despite this growth, losing $15 million on sales of $593 million.

AMD expects to grow revenue by 12% year over year during the second quarter, a number that isn't as impressive as it seems. The second quarter will include a full quarter of Polaris, which didn't launch until the end of the second quarter last year, a full quarter of Ryzen 7, nearly a full quarter of Ryzen 5, the mainstream line of AMD's new CPUs, and some contribution from Vega and Naples, AMD's upcoming high-end GPU and server chip.
Given all of these new products, investors were likely expecting more than a 12% revenue increase for the second quarter. This lackluster guidance prompted Macquarie to downgrade the stock to ""underperform,"" slashing the price target to just $10 per share. Goldman also cut its price target down to $10.50 per share.
With stiff competition from Intel and NVIDIA, AMD's turnaround is not going to be easy. Given the surge in the stock price last year, investors were betting on AMD's new products making a big splash. Polaris and Ryzen are driving growth but not nearly enough to justify the runaway optimism of the past year.
Vega and Naples are still set to launch during the second quarter, and they should drive growth during the second half. But how much growth and whether the bottom line will finally turn the corner in a meaningful way remain to be seen.

            ","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...
For months, analysts on Wall Street have been singing the praises of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), arguing that AMD is gaining strength in PCs, in artificial intelligence, and in computer deep learning. But yesterday, AMD reported its financial results for fiscal Q1 2017, and all of a sudden, not all analysts are certain AMD is as good as it looked before.
Shares of AMD tumbled as much as 20.6% in Tuesday morning trading after those earnings came out, and analysts are deeply divided on what they mean. Here are three things you need to know.
Few analysts were shocked when historically unprofitable chipmaker AMD lost money again in Q1. Image source: Getty Images.
On the plus side, AMD satisfied analyst expectations for earnings yesterday, reporting 18% growth in revenue, and quarterly losses just one third ($0.04 per share) of what the company lost one year ago ($0.12 per share). TheFly.com confirms that these numbers basically met the expectations that analysts had set for the stock -- $0.04 per share in losses, on revenue of $984.4 million.
Investment banker Wells Fargo, which has an outperform rating on AMD stock, quickly hailed the results as proof that AMD is ""continuing to execute well,"" as the TheFly reports. Accordingly, Wells raised its price target on AMD stock to a range of $13 to $15 per share.
Canadian banker Canaccord -- likewise an AMD backer with a buy rating -- argued that AMD's Ryzen line of desktop CPUs is gaining traction in the market. The analyst doubled down on its buy rating, and continues to insist that AMD's stock, which was priced at $13 and change before earnings, and which sold as low as sub-$11 on Tuesday, is worth at least $17 a share.
But not all analysts are enthusiastic. Goldman Sachs for example, which made a bold call against AMD stock earlier this year, zeroed in on weak guidance at AMD as supporting its thesis that the stock is ""priced for perfection."" Operating costs are rising, warns Goldman, while free cash flow has already turned negative at AMD. Accordingly, Goldman is also doubling down on its rating -- sell -- and cutting its price target to $10.60 per share.
Citigroup, meanwhile, is even less certain of AMD's chances. Rating AMD stock a sell as well, Citi sets its price target at just $4 a share. Why? Says Citi, while AMD has raised revenue guidance for the current second quarter of 2017, the company cut its gross margin guidance by 60 basis points, which implies that added revenue may not add much to AMD's profit. Even more worrisome, Citi points out that AMD's ""inventory and valuation are at the all-time highs despite the company losing money,"" writes TheFly.
Finally, Australian banker Macquarie has just chimed in with an actual downgrade of AMD stock, cutting AMD to underperform (with a $10 price target). In a note covered on StreetInsider.com, Macquarie echoes Citi's concerns that margin expansion ""will prove to be a challenge,"" and warns that any market share AMD is gaining from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will quickly be lost again to Intel when it cuts prices on its chips to win back customers from AMD. And with AMD warning that its gross margin is already starting to ebb, AMD may not be able to survive a price war against Intel.
So how bad was AMD's report, actually? Pretty bad -- and certainly worse than media reports, which have been focusing on AMD's pro forma numbers, let on.
By the pro forma standard of non-GAAP financial results, AMD lost only $0.04 per share last quarter, which as I said above was a two-thirds improvement from last year's Q1 pro forma loss of $0.12. Under GAAP accounting standards, however, AMD lost $0.14 per share in Q1 2016, and cut that loss by less than half in Q1 2017, to $0.08 per share -- twice the size of the pro forma loss that AMD bulls are citing. Free cash flow, as Goldman Sachs pointed out, ran negative to the tune of $322 million in cash burnt during the quarter.
Meanwhile, on the guidance front, AMD:
So how should investors make sense of all the above? Here's how I look at it:
AMD did what analysts expected it to do last quarter, but really, since they expected it to lose money, that's not something to boast about. Moreover, AMD has lost money every year for the past five years, and burned cash in most of those years as well. Although AMD briefly turned slightly free cash flow positive last year (generating positive free cash flow of $13 million on sales of $4.3 billion according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence), AMD is once again back to burning cash and losing money in Q1 2017.
Meanwhile, AMD is guiding toward only moderate growth in sales next quarter, and promising weakening profit margins, which sounds a lot like what the AMD doomsayers have been predicting -- that AMD might gain market share temporarily, but would quickly suffer the ill effects of a price war as Intel, NVIDIA, and other chip rivals fight back for their lost share.
To me, none of this sounds like a scenario that will end in AMD breaking its historical pattern of losing money and burning cash. Put me in the bears column on this one. If you own AMD stock, now seems like a good time to declare victory, take profits, and seek a more viable business to put them to work in.

            ","For all the potential scientific and cultural advances brought about by artificial intelligence (AI), it is the humble silicon chip that makes it all possible. Sure, there was the confluence of big data, cloud computing, and the right algorithms, but without the underlying CPUs and GPUs, none of this would have occurred.
With artificial intelligence still in its infancy, there are opportunities for investors to benefit from this paradigm shift that melds science and computing. We don't know who the ultimate winner in AI will be, and there will likely be more than one. What we do know, though, is that chips will be there. 
Market intelligence firm Tractica estimates that chipset shipments for AI will grow from 863,000 units in 2016 to 41.2 million units annually by 2025. Two companies are currently positioned to benefit the most from the rapid technological innovations brought on by AI, with one more to watch: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).

NVIDIA leveraged its position in the AI revolution by having the right tool for the job when AI came calling. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) can handle large numbers of basic mathematical calculations simultaneously. The way these chips processed graphics and AI math calculations was strikingly similar and gave NVIDIA a lead in the space. The computationally intense training of AI systems is still primarily the domain of GPUs, and NVIDIA sits firmly in the lead.
In 2016, NVIDIA grew its revenue 38% over the prior year to a record $6.91 billion and increased earnings per share by 138%. In its most recent quarter, data center revenue, where its AI chip business is housed, more than tripled over the prior-year quarter to 14% of the company's revenue. The stock price mirrored its financial performance with the stock up 230% for 2016. 
Intel held its ""AI Day: Unleashing the Next Wave"" to lay out its vision for AI. Image source: Intel.
Intel has designs on the AI space, and the company has made numerous acquisitions that place it squarely at the intersection of several emerging trends.
Altera developed a field programmable gate array (FPGAs), a chip that can be customized or configured by a customer after manufacturing. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) deploys these across its Azure cloud server system for the inferencing stage of AI -- performing a function once the AI system has already been trained -- for applications such as image recognition.
Machine learning start-up Movidius produced systems on a chip (SoC) designed for the computer vision systems used by drones and virtual reality headsets that reduced the power consumption of these data-intensive systems. Deep learning start-up Nervana developed an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that is central to Intel's Lake Crest chip (aka, Nervana Engine), which is custom-designed and optimized for AI.
Most recently, Intel acquired machine learning and computer vision company Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY), which developed cameras used in autonomous driving and software that could detect hazards or obstructions that will be central to self-driving car technology. 
Each of the chips in Intel's arsenal serves a distinct function, and these acquisitions give the company a stake in a variety of applications that cut a broad path through the AI marketplace. It would be hard to gage the impact of these latest developments on future performance, but given the breadth of applications, Intel will likely thrive.

AMD is playing catch up in the field and recently released an entire line of chips aimed squarely at deep learning AI applications. While it has produced GPUs for years, it only recently developed processors specifically for AI. AMD has a dedicated following among those looking for a ""quality on a budget,"" and it appears to be pursuing the same strategy in AI. There are also indications that its new line of dedicated chips may seek to match or improve upon existing performance across a broad range of AI applications.
AMD gained market share and rode the coattails of its larger rival with its stock price quadrupling over 2016, while its revenue grew 7% to $4.27 billion. It remains to be seen if AMD can affect a market that is currently dominated by NVIDIA. It may be able to create a niche similar to the one it carved out for itself in the gaming market. 
While each of these companies offers a different way to play the AI market, it is important to note that the field is still in its infancy, and no one solution works best for every application. There is still the potential that someone will build a better mousetrap that will make any or all of the choices described above obsolete. Such is the nature of investing in emerging technology -- fortunes are made and lost, sometimes overnight.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has jumped over 15% this year thanks to a strong fourth-quarter report in February that bested Wall Street's expectations. Higher graphics card sales have boosted the semiconductor specialist's performance, and investors will be looking for a repeat performance when the company reports its first-quarter results after the bell on May 1.
Here's what investors can expect from AMD's upcoming earnings report.
Wall Street expects 18% year-over-year growth in AMD's revenue, to $984 million, while its losses could go down from $0.12 per share to $0.04 per share. The expectations are in line with the company's guidance as the recently launched Ryzen CPU is expected to boost sales and margins.
AMD is trying to break Intel's monopoly in desktop CPUs by offering a capable chip at cheap prices. For instance, the $400 Ryzen 7 1700X processor has a better clock speed and lower power consumption figures than Intel's Core i7 6900K chip, which costs around $1,000. Therefore, it won't be surprising if AMD managed to take away some market share from Intel and improve its top line during the first quarter.

However, BMO Capital Markets' supply chain checks indicate weakness in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are AMD's bread-and-butter business, noting a 16% decline in GPU shipments from Q4 to Q1, outpacing the average seasonal drop of 6% seen in the last three years.
AMD has already accounted for the seasonal revenue decline, forecasting an 11% sequential drop. However, the strong year-over-year growth estimate suggests confidence as it takes the GPU fight to NVIDIA.
AMD controlled an estimated 29.5% of the discrete GPU market in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 22.8% in the first quarter. The market-share numbers for the latest quarter aren't out yet.
New products are estimated to increase AMD's gross margin to 33%, up 1 percentage point from last year, and help the company cut its losses significantly.
AMD's outlook will be driven by the GPU market's growth. Research firm M Science's checks indicate that high-end GPU pricing in North America has recovered over the past quarter, pointing toward strong demand. Moreover, the GPU market should get better as the year progresses, as sales of PC gaming hardware are expected to increase 6% in 2017 thanks to robust demand for high-end systems, according to Jon Peddie Research.
This is good news for AMD investors as the company's upcoming Vega GPU is aiming at the premium GPU segment. The new graphics cards are expected to go on sale sometime in May, taking on NVIDIA's latest GTX 1080 Ti GPU.
AMD's VP of Radeon gaming, Scott Herkelman, said that the Vega GPU could match the GTX 1080 Ti in memory performance, which could give it a leg up over NVIDIA if it is priced at the lower end of its expected $600-$700 range.
What's more, AMD is also finding traction in the server market. Google is using the graphics specialist's FirePro server GPUs to accelerate its Google Cloud Machine Learning and Google Compute Engine services. This business should get better with the launch of AMD's next-gen server CPU -- Naples.
AMD claims that Naples can outperform Intel's flagship server CPU in certain workload scenarios, though investors should take the tests with a grain of salt since they are not independent. But it is evident that AMD is trying to corner more of the booming server market that will need more powerful CPUs and GPUs as data-center workloads increase due to growing data volumes and complexity.
AMD investors should expect a solid outlook as the company gains traction in key end markets on the back of smart product development moves.

            ","Goldman Sachs believes that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is going to face fierce competition from rivals NVIDIA and Intel, which will discount their products to defend their market share in graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). As a result, Goldman rates AMD a sell with an $11 price target.
There's no denying that NVIDIA and Intel dominate the GPU and CPU markets hands-down, with market shares of 70% and 99%, respectively, giving them the luxury to cut pricing and keep AMD away. As it turns out, Intel has already responded to AMD's latest Ryzen CPU with a price cut, with NVIDIA following suit.
Not surprisingly, AMD is looking at nascent opportunities where it can take a lead over its rivals to ensure long-term growth, and virtual reality (VR) is one such space.

AMD has just spent an undisclosed amount to acquire technology start-up Nitero, which manufactures chips to enable wireless connectivity between VR headsets and computers for content streaming. The semiconductor specialist's latest acquisition is going to solve one major problem that's holding back VR headset adoption -- tethering.
Image source: Nitero.
High-end VR headsets are currently dependent on bulky cables to stream content and draw power from desktop computers, limiting the user's mobility and tarnishing the VR experience. Nitero is trying to address this problem as it specializes in the 60 GHz millimeter wave radio technology that enables wireless device communication over short ranges.
As it turns out, a few companies are already working to make VR headsets wireless. TPCast, which is backed by HTC, believes that it can get wireless HTC Vive accessory to the market in the second quarter of the year. However, the bolt-on accessory could cost $249, adding to the price of an already expensive headset.
Nitero, however, could bring down the cost of making a wireless VR headset, since it's designing chips exclusively for this purpose, allowing it to deliver high-bandwidth data transfer with low latency (delays and time-lags). By comparison, other companies are tweaking existing solutions to fit this scenario, which is increasing the cost in the process.
AMD, therefore, aims to become the chip supplier of choice for next-generation VR headsets to enable wireless connectivity, which could substantially boost its revenue.
IDC estimates that VR headset sales could grow sixfold to 61 million units in 2020 from a projected 10 million units this year. AMD can take advantage of this opportunity by either making an add-on accessory that it can sell as an upgrade, or by making custom chips that are embedded in the headset itself.
A typical add-on adapter costs $250 at present, indicating that AMD's total addressable market could grow to $15 billion by 2020, according to the 61 million-headset sale forecast. But this isn't what AMD probably intends to do with Nitero's technology. It might either create its own chips or license the design to headset makers for a royalty, though it's difficult to gauge the size of this opportunity.
But AMD investors shouldn't forget that it will run into stiff competition from Qualcomm, which recently announced a VR development kit that's focused on providing an ""un-tethered"" experience.
Qualcomm is looking to reduce the go-to-market time of headset manufacturers through its VR development kit and the head-mounted display accelerator program by giving them access to all the important hardware tools. The kit consists of a Snapdragon 835-powered headset that also includes memory chips, audio chips, and connectivity chips, indicating that it's trying to corner a greater share of the market for itself.
But the VR opportunity is a huge one, and it can definitely accommodate more than two players, as different companies are trying to attack different aspects of the market. AMD, for its part, is doing the right thing by focusing on the wireless-chip opportunity, as the gradual move toward cordless VR headsets can give its business a nice boost.

            ","With the launch of high-end and mainstream Ryzen CPUs in the rearview mirror, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will report its first-quarter results after the market closes on May 1. Ryzen 7, AMD's attempt to compete with the best of Intel, became available on March 2, while the mainstream Ryzen 5 launched after the close of the first quarter.
AMD's first-quarter numbers will provide investors the first glimpse of how well Ryzen 7 is selling, but the guidance for the second quarter will be the most telling. Investors will be looking for an optimistic outlook given the flurry of product launches. Beyond CPUs, AMD refreshed its mainstream Polaris GPU line in April, and it plans to roll out its high-end Vega GPUs and Naples server CPUs sometime during the second quarter.
The stock has surged over the past year on anticipation that all of these new products would drive growth and return the company to profitability. It's now time for the company to prove those optimistic investors right or wrong.
Image source: AMD.
The only piece of guidance AMD provided for the first quarter called for an 11% sequential decrease in revenue, plus or minus 3%, which comes out to an 18% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. That's about $988 million, right around the average analyst estimate of $984 million.
AMD's original line of Polaris graphics cards didn't launch until June of last year, so much of this growth will likely be driven by stronger GPU sales. Ryzen 7 will also contribute, but a shortage of compatible motherboards soon after launch may have put a damper on sales.
Turning to the bottom line, analysts are expecting AMD to post an adjusted loss of $0.04 per share during the first quarter. The average analyst estimate calls for just $0.08 in adjusted EPS this year and $0.29 in adjusted EPS next year. These estimates could be off the mark by a wide margin if AMD's new products perform better than expected, but they do raise some questions about the valuation. Trading around $13.50 per share, AMD stock is priced for something close to the best-case scenario.
AMD needs a lot to go right this year for the surge in the stock price to be justified. Ryzen will have to pick up considerable market share, and both Vega and Naples must live up to expectations. The second-quarter report will include contributions from those two product lines, assuming AMD launches them on time.
Vega is AMD's reentry into the high-end GPU market. Its last attempt was in 2015 with its Radeon Fury cards, but those were unable to compete with NVIDIA's high-end offerings. AMD has fallen into a pattern of playing catch-up instead of leapfrogging the competition, and it will need to break free from that trend with Vega if it wants any chance of winning considerable market share.
NVIDIA won't be sitting on its hands. A rumor recently emerged that NVIDIA was prepping its next-generation Volta architecture for launch during the third quarter, a move that could undercut AMD if Vega manages to beat out NVIDIA's current lineup.
Naples is AMD's reentry into the server chip market, where it has essentially no presence at all. Intel enjoys a near-100% market share, so Naples is all upside for AMD. Even small market-share gains will provide a revenue boost, although the chips will need to be competitive with Intel's offerings. Benchmarks from AMD suggest that Naples is the real deal, but we'll need to wait for launch before it's clear how competitive the new products truly are.
2017 is a big year for AMD, and the first-quarter report will be the company's first test. Investors will be looking for revenue growth and a move toward profitability, as well as positive commentary from management regarding the performance of Ryzen. Guidance needs to be strong with both Vega and Naples launching in the second quarter. Otherwise, the stock may not hold onto the gains from the past year.

            ","One of the most gratifying feelings as an investor is to see your buy thesis for any given stock come to fruition. But given the happy consequence of share-price appreciation that tends to come with this type of situation, you might be left wondering whether it would be wise to take profits off the table.
So we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to weigh in on what investors should think about three popular high-flying stocks. Read on to learn what they had to say about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.
Steve Symington (Advanced Micro Devices): Shares of AMD have soared nearly 400% over the past year as of this writing, and with good reason. After losing significant graphics card market share to competitor NVIDIA from late 2014 through the middle of 2015, AMD gradually regained its footing to end 2016 with market share of roughly 29.5% (up from 21.6% at the start of the year). Most recently, AMD investors are rightly excited over the prospects for the impending launch of high-end cards based on the chipmaker's Vega GPU architecture.
But given its meteoric rise, I'm not the only one worried that AMD's stock price may have gotten ahead of the actual business. Earlier this month, shares declined after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on AMD with a sell rating and $11-per-share price target (the current price is around $13), arguing that AMD's remaining market-share gains are limited, and that both NVIDIA and Intel have the flexibility to reduce their own chip prices in an effort to stem AMD's progress, if necessary. The GPU market also tends to ebb and flow given the combination of upgrade cycles and continuous innovation in the space. So investors shouldn't underestimate the ability of AMD's competitors to claw back what they've lost over the past year with their own new technology.
But more concerning is the fact that AMD still isn't profitable, delivering a GAAP net loss of $497 million last year and an adjusted (non-GAAP) net loss of $117 million -- albeit narrowed from 2015 GAAP and adjusted losses of $660 million and $419 million, respectively. So if AMD suffers any hiccups this year as it strives to maintain its momentum and return to sustained, profitable growth, I fear its stock price will give back the recent gains in a hurry.
Brian Stoffel (Veeva Systems): Veeva Systems has found a very profitable niche. The company, which is the brainchild of its founder-CEO and former salesforce.com executive, Peter Gassner, offers cloud solutions to drug companies. These solutions can do everything from tracking sales of certain drugs to storing and sharing mission-critical information during the drug approval process.
Shareholders have been rewarded handsomely for their faith in Gassner and company, with the stock up 140% since February of last year. But that has put the company in nosebleed-valuation territory. Currently, shares trade hands for 69 times non-GAAP earnings and 51 times free cash flow.
When stocks have this type of valuation, the slightest worry can send shares down. And in fact, there are a number of things that investors need to be aware of. For starters, Veeva has developed a cloud solution for clients outside of the pharmaceutical industry. I believe part of the run-up in price is associated with high sales expectations for Veeva in this new venture. But this new path is untested, and it remains to be seen how well it will be received in other industries.
Furthermore, Veeva has made it clear that it will be investing aggressively in its future. That means that while sales may continue to grow, profitability may not. In fact, after adjusting their calculations, analysts expect Veeva to show non-GAAP EPS growth of only 8% this year. That's not typically what you'd expect from such an expensive stock.
But, as a long-term shareholder, I am unconcerned. I am well-aware that Veeva's stock may fall in the short term. That is the nature of its industry. Over the long run, however, I have faith in the company's moat and its undeniable business momentum.
Dan Caplinger (Tesla): Tesla has gotten headlines lately because investors have assigned a valuation on the company that exceeds those of the much more mature Big Three automakers. Just since the beginning of 2017, Tesla is up 40%, yet the company is nowhere near being profitable. The stock price implies a multiple to trailing sales of 7, and skeptics believe that there's little chance that Tesla can ramp up quickly enough to justify its current valuation even as the mass-market Model 3 approaches its anticipated release date later this year and starts to deliver on the roughly 400,000 preorders that the new car company has gotten for the lower-end Tesla car.
Tesla has a number of growth prospects in its pipeline that it hopes will allow it to maximize its potential. On the solar front, Tesla has released new solar panels that it claims have more attractive designs to entice homeowners into using them on their homes. Meanwhile, the automaker also foresees entering the commercial transportation arena, with a heavy-duty truck and transit alternatives that could take advantage of Tesla technology for non-consumer purposes. None of this is to say that Tesla isn't richly valued and potentially vulnerable to a decline, but people have been predicting that Tesla would see an outright crash for a long time without having succeeded. Betting against Tesla right now is likely a mistake.

            ","The yearlong run of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock came to a sudden halt last week after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on the semiconductor specialist with a sell rating and an $11 price target, compared to the $13 that it is trading for at the time of writing. Analyst Toshia Hari believes that the chipmaker has gotten ahead of itself after its terrific 390%-plus rally over the past year, as rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) could knock the wind out of AMD's sails through discounted products.
Hari's research note points out that AMD's market share won't improve dramatically with its new products as NVIDIA and Intel could cut prices of their chips to keep the former under pressure. The analyst wrote, ""While we expect Intel and NVIDIA to remain disciplined on pricing, if necessary, both companies have the capacity to compete on price given significantly higher gross margins.""
Evidently, Hari's thesis is based on AMD's new products failing to do as well as expected because of competition from rivals. But this ignores the recent popularity of AMD's GPUs that has led to a turnaround in the companys market share in recent quarters, and that its latest products are reportedly delivering more performance for less money -- which could give the chipmaker an edge over NVIDIA and Intel.
AMD has broken into NVIDIA's stronghold in the discrete graphics processing unit (GPU) market over the past year thanks to its focus on providing powerful graphics cards to gamers on a budget.

It is now going after NVIDIA in high-end graphics with its latest Vega GPU, and could possibly match NVIDIA's latest GTX 1080 Ti graphics card, if claims by an AMD executive (via The Inquirer) are to be believed. Though AMD hasn't released the tech specs and the pricing of the Vega GPU yet, it is expected to be in line with NVIDIA's $699 price for the 1080 Ti, with a price tag between $600 and $700.
According to leaked information the Vega GPU is going to pack a lot of computing power, and is said to be two times faster than the NVIDIA Pascal X in deep-learning scenarios. If AMD undercuts NVIDIA's latest offering on pricing and delivers an identical performance, then it stands to gain more market share.
Intel has a vise-like grip over the server chip market, with a share of 99.3% in the third quarter of 2016. However, AMD is now going to try and hurt Intel's near-monopoly in this market with its Naples architecture.
The Naples CPU for servers was previewed by AMD in early March and is claimed to carry 45% more cores and 122% more bandwidth memory than Intel's fastest Xeon server chip. AMD believes that the stronger specs allow Naples to perform at least twice as fast as the Intel offering in various seismic analysis scenarios, though independent benchmark tests will illustrate the real potential of these chips.
Cisco forecasts that data centers will witness a 262% spike in traffic in 2020 from 2015 levels, processing 92% of the workload in the cloud. AMD's movement into the server-chip market is timely, as data center servers are going to need a lot of processing power.

Similarly, AMD is trying to challenge Intel's stronghold in the desktop CPU market with its Ryzen CPUs. As it turns out, AMD's flagship Ryzen 1800X CPU costs half as much as a comparable Intel Broadwell processor, which could make it the processor of choice for workstation users. Intel has recently lowered the price of its processors, indicating that it is scared of AMD's potential gains in the desktop CPU market.
Goldman Sachs' bearish outlook on AMD is not in line with the Wall Street consensus. Jefferies and Susquehanna have both raised their price targets on the semiconductor specialist in the past month, citing possible market share gains -- thanks to the growing adoption of its Ryzen chips -- that could drive incremental sales of $1.1 billion to $4.6 billion.
Three analysts have raised their earnings projections for the current year and none have revised down. Investors, therefore, shouldn't get into panic-selling mode after the Goldman Sachs downgrade, as market share gains could boost AMD going forward.

            ","While Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) reentry into the high-end graphics card market with Vega is nearing, the company launched a separate set of graphics cards on April 18. The Radeon RX 500 series is a refresh of AMD's Radeon RX 400 series, based on the mainstream Polaris GPUs. The RX 580 and RX 570 are available immediately, the RX 550 will be available on April 20, and the RX 560 will launch sometime in May.
The RX 400 series launched in the middle of last year, making AMD more competitive with rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the mainstream portion of the graphics card market. This initial launch of Polaris helped drive some much-needed growth for AMD, but NVIDIA was able to maintain its market share lead by launching its own mainstream graphics cards, the GTX 1060 and GTX 1050.
The RX 500 series graphics cards bring some minor performance improvements, but they still fall short of NVIDIA's offerings. Polaris didn't light the world on fire last year, and it's likely not going to fare much better this year, either.
Image source: AMD.
The 8 GB version of the RX 580 is priced at $229, the same price that NVIDIA's 6 GB GTX 1060 is now available for. This presents a problem for AMD. While the RX 580 provides a performance improvement compared to the RX 480, about 3% according to Anandtech, it still falls short of the GTX 1060 on average. Across all of Anantech's gaming benchmarks, the RX 580 falls 7% short of the GTX 1060 on average at both 1080p and 1440p resolutions.
Not only does AMD still fall short of NVIDIA in terms of performance with the RX 580, but the power efficiency of the RX 500 series cards has gotten worse compared to the RX 400 series. AMD sacrificed efficiency for performance, but it still wasn't enough to match NVIDIA's offerings.
The gap between AMD's mainstream graphics cards and NVIDIA's mainstream graphics cards is now smaller with the RX 500 series, but it's still there. That makes the prospect of AMD picking up meaningful market share in the mainstream portion of the market unlikely.
Vega is the big graphics card story for AMD this year, and if the company can come out with competitive high-end products, it could claw back some lucrative high-end market share from NVIDIA. In the mainstream market, only price cuts that give AMD an edge will change the dynamic.
Neither AMD nor NVIDIA provide detailed sales figures for specific graphics cards, but PC gaming platform Steam publishes hardware survey data each month. This data is far from perfect, and it may not be a great representation of the graphics card market as a whole. But with Steam being the dominant PC gaming platform, this data gives investors some idea of how well various graphics cards are selling.
A look at the data tells you one thing: NVIDIA is overwhelmingly dominant. The top 16 most popular DirectX 12 graphics cards are all NVIDIA. The GTX 1060 is No. 4 on the list, with 4.45% of survey respondents owning the card. It's beaten only by older NVIDIA products. The most popular AMD Polaris graphics card is the RX 480, which is owned by just 1.05% of survey respondents. The GTX 1060 is more than four times as popular.
With the RX 500 series failing to shake things up, NVIDIA's dominance in the mainstream graphics card market will likely continue.

            ","The semiconductor industry isn't for the faint of heart. Competition is typically extremely fierce, product cycles force companies to keep betting on the next breakthrough chip, and in an effort to win spots in major devices, chipmakers often sell at lower prices than they'd like. 
For those reasons, it can be difficult to pick winners in this space. That's why investors considering Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) should know the opportunities and risks for both companies so let's take a quick look at what each is doing: 

AMD is a key player in graphics processing unit (GPU) space with about 29.5% of the discrete desktop GPU market. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) takes the rest of the market, but investors should remember that this time last year AMD held just 21.6% market share, so the company is moving in the right direction. Additionally, AMD is set to release a new GPU architecture later this year called Vega, which could help the company wrest a little more market share away from NVIDIA as well.
It's highly unlikely that AMD will overcome NVIDIA in the GPU space, but the former is still  making solid advancements across its key business. The company posted higher sales of GPUs in Q4 2016 than it has in the past 11 quarters. AMD is also a major supplier of semicustom console chips for Sony and Microsoft, the latter of which is expected to launch a new device, called Project Scorpio, later this year. Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri believes that semicustom design wins like this could spur growth in this segment by low double digits over the next four years.
It's worth pointing out that despite its massive stock price run-up right now, the company has had a net operating loss for at least the past three years. Investors currently value it at more than $11 billion, while AMD's operating income loss was $372 million last year. That means AMD would have to churn out massive profits in the coming years to catch up to its current valuation. 

Data source: YCharts.
Ambarella's story is largely one that's built around GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO). Pacific Crest estimates that 25% of Ambarella's 2016 revenue came from from the action camera maker. Ambarella's reliance on GoPro was fine when things were going well with GoPro's sales, but lately the camera maker has hit one roadblock after another, most recently with the recall of its much-anticipated Karma drone.
Ambarella does deserve credit for expanding its chip sales beyond GoPro into the security camera maker, DJI drones, and cars. But even with even with that diversification sales in fiscal year 2017 fell by nearly 2% from a year ago, and the company's management has noted that changes to GoPro's business could weigh on Ambarella's revenue this year. ""[B]ased on our current level of interaction with GoPro on product development activities, we believe GoPro is incorporating a competitive chip for at least one new mainstream camera product, which will negatively impact our revenues in the second half of the year,"" Ambarella CFO George Laplante said on the fourth-quarter earnings call.
I did a comparison of these two companies about four months ago and said at the time that any pullback in sales from GoPro could bring further instability to Amberella, but if it was able to diversify revenue enough, then the company could become a solid long-term play. Unfortunately, it appears the GoPro pullback is the main story right now. Sure, Ambarella is diversifying sales to other players, but I don't believe it's happening fast enough. Management said that sales growth for fiscal 2018 will be between 3% growth to a 3% drop, compared to fiscal 2017.
At the same time, I find it difficult to recommend AMD after its current stock price growth, compared to net losses. The company is certainly making strides in GPUs and semicustom chips, but with investors already pushing the stock price up more than 360% over the past 12 months, I think AMD's opportunities have already been worked into the company's price.
In this face-off, AMD looks like the better business, but investors may want to wait and see if any short-term hiccups offer better entry points down the road.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have absolutely crushed the market recently, soaring 366% higher in the last 52 weeks. You may know the company as an eternal foil to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the market for PC processors, and AMD's duels with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the graphics chip sector are also the stuff of legend.
The company currently shows negative profits but positive cash flows, and management hopes to have found a path back to sustainable black ink on the bottom line. Analysts tend to agree, painting a picture of healthy sales growth with a side of positive and rising profits over the next two years.
That's a snapshot of AMD's headline news. Here's a handful of facts that might be unfamiliar to many AMD investors.
Image source: AMD.
One year after Intel's founding fathers left Fairchild Semiconductor to start their own pioneering business, AMD's founders followed suit. Eight former Fairchild engineers and executives struck out on their own, under the helm of CEO Jerry Sanders. AMD shares started selling on the NYSE exchange in 1979.
Just three years after that, IBM (NYSE:IBM) reached out to secure a second source of processors for its recently launched PC systems. Working under an Intel license for x86 technologies, this became AMD's mainstay business for the next 35 years.
By 1995, AMD's K5 and K6 processors were putting significant pressure on Intel's PC market stature. The chips offered competitive performance at a much lower price point, forcing Intel to adjust its own pricing strategies.
In 1997, AMD presented its first Athlon processor. The company introduced many industry-first innovations over the next few years, like the first 64-bit x86 processor, the first dual-core PC processor, and the energy-saving PowerNow! and Cool'n'Quiet technologies. These were the days where AMD had Intel paying defense, catching up to AMD's innovations rather than the other way around.
AMD CEO Lisa Su. Image source: AMD.
Jerry Sanders served as AMD's CEO for the first 33 years. On his retirement, the executive suite saw a flurry of four new CEOs in 12 years.
Current corporate leader Lisa Su brought AMD back to a technical focus that some of her recent, more business-oriented predecessors had lacked. During her doctorate work in electrical engineering at MIT, she advanced the idea of silicon-on-insulator chip-building technologies that AMD uses today.
Taking the helm in 2014, Su quickly established a new company strategy with a heavy focus on developing new technology to address growing markets. She had been pushing for such changes from the senior VP level, starting in 2012. Five years ago, some 90% of AMD's total sales were designed for use in PC systems. Su wants about half of her company's revenue to come from other markets such as gaming consoles and embedded systems, and had reached a 60-40 split between PC and non-PC sales by 2015.
Once upon a time, AMD built its own microprocessors in company-owned factories. A long-standing manufacturing research partnership with IBM helped to keep those chipmaking operations going. But things have changed.
Investment groups from Abu Dhabi started building ownership in AMD in 2007, and right at the darkest days of the 2008 financial crisis, that relationship led to AMD's manufacturing operations spinning off into a joint venture called GlobalFoundries. While the rest of the world seemed stopped in its financial tracks, AMD shares surged 30% in a single day on this news.
GlobalFoundries still counts AMD as its largest customer, but now operates as a completely separate business with plenty of supply contracts with other chip designers.
The manufacturing spinoff gave AMD a fighting chance to survive as Intel retook its throne while market conditions started to shift away from PC systems. The balance sheet lightened immensely when the GlobalFoundries separation closed in 2010.
AMD used the funds from that deal to pay down debt balances, and annual interest payments took a deep dive. Without the GlobalFoundries transaction, AMD probably wouldn't have survived this far. So AMD is now a fab-less chip designer, and better off for it.

AMD was a member of the S&P 500 index back in the Athlon-and-K6 heyday. The stock was dropped from that prestigious index in 2013 due to a plunging market cap, falling back to the lesser S&P MidCap 400 index instead.
As of March 2017, AMD is back in the big leagues. The stock replaced crumbling retailer Urban Outfitters before the opening bell on March 20. At the time, AMD investors could look back at one-year share price gains of 390% while Urban Outfitters suffered a 30% haircut over the same period.
Lisa Su is one of just 30 female CEOs among the 500 index members today. That's up from 23 female leaders two years ago, but the S&P 500 club is still hardly a model of gender equality.
In other stock-related news, AMD spent 33 years on the New York Stock Exchange before jumping to the Nasdaq exchange in December 2014. Then-CFO Devinder Kumar described the move as a way to align the company more closely with other technology businesses on that exchange, and also to provide better lines of communication with investors. But the NYSE charges significantly higher listing fees than the Nasdaq, and AMD can use every penny of cost-cutting it can get -- especially when the business of developing and selling computer chips doesn't suffer from the change.
The company has worked strictly within the Intel-compatible x86 world for decades, supplemented by graphics processors. Competing processor architectures from ARM Holdings -- now a part of the SoftBank Group -- were always more of a threat than an opportunity.
That started to change in 2012.
AMD secured a license to design an ARM-based processor, immediately inserted ARM-based solutions to handle security tasks in mobile processors, and announced that ARM-style server chips would be cut from whole AMD cloth as soon as 2014. Of course, Lisa Su was on stage for that announcement in her capacity as global products manager at the time. Her fingerprints are all over this project.
It took a bit longer than that, but AMD did indeed launch its first ARM-powered server processor in 2016.
The AMD Opteron A1100 puts eight high-end ARM cores together with enterprise features like built-in high-speed networking, fast access to system data via 8 PCI-Express lanes, and support for large quantities of DDR4 memory with error correction. It's a new system-building option for server manufacturers, offering low power consumption and a performance profile tuned for managing massive amounts of data transfer. The target market here is cloud-based storage platforms, and the Opteron A1100 series also works well as the storage-management component of a multisystem big data analysis solution.

            ","After launching the high-end Ryzen 7 line of PC CPUs in March to somewhat mixed reviews, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is now taking a crack at the mainstream portion of the market. Ryzen 5, comprised of four CPUs featuring either four or six cores, is aimed at Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i5 family of chips. Priced between $169 and $249, Ryzen 5 offers more cores and threads than Intel's comparable chips. But the same trade-off that made Ryzen 7 a mixed bag persists: Single-threaded performance is a weakness for Ryzen, and AMD's pricing may not be aggressive enough to overcome that issue.
The highest-end Ryzen 5 chip, the 1600X, is priced at $249, offering six cores and 12 threads. The 1600X is essentially the Ryzen 1800X with two cores and $150 lopped off, making it a good budget option for those who use applications that can take advantage of that many threads. Like the 1800X, though, the 1600X falls short when single-threaded performance is important.
Image source: AMD.
The 1600 also has six cores and 12 threads, but it comes with a lower clock speed and a $219 price tag. The 1500X and 1400 both come with four cores and eight threads priced at $189 and $169, respectively, with the 1400 having a lower clock speed and half as much L3 cache as the rest of the Ryzen 5 lineup.
The competition is Intel's Core i5 line of chips. All of Intel i5 chips come with at most four cores, and those quad-core chips don't support hyperthreading, meaning that the number of threads is equal to the number of cores. All the Ryzen 5 chips have a major advantage when it comes to multithreaded performance due to this discrepancy -- the same story that played out with Ryzen 7.
Like Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 is at an inherent disadvantage when it comes to single-threaded performance. In its review of Ryzen 5, Anandtech puts that disadvantage at about 10% to 15%. The upside is that the two higher-end Ryzen 5 chips have 50% more cores and triple the threads compared to Intel's i5 chips.
In situations where single-threaded performance matters greatly, like opening PDF documents and in games that don't make great use of more than a few cores, Ryzen 5 gets trounced by Intel's Core i5 chips. The i5-7600 is 16.7% faster at opening a PDF document than the 1600X, according to Anandtech's review, a difference that will be noticeable to users.
Ryzen 5 falls well behind in some games. Anandtech's test of Rise of the Tomb Raider has the 1600X with a 28% lower frame rate at a 1080p resolution. That gap disappears at a 4K resolution, but that's only because the GPU becomes the bottleneck.
Ryzen 5 fares far better in other games, though, thanks to its core count advantage. Anandtech's Civilization 6 benchmark has the 1600X well ahead of the i5-7600 at both 1080p and 4K resolutions. When it comes to gaming, Ryzen 5 seems to be more competitive than Ryzen 7, which was beat by cheaper Intel chips in most gaming benchmarks.
Ryzen 5 shines in applications that can make full use of its cores. Applications like compressing files, encoding video, and 3D rendering all benefit greatly from a higher core count. Anandtech's 7-Zip compression benchmark, for example, has the 1600X scoring nearly 90% higher than the i5-7600. Ryzen 5 is the runaway winner for these types of applications.
The 1600X priced at $249 is a no-brainer for users that benefit from more cores. But as a mainstream gaming CPU, the 1600X is more of a mixed bag. Intel's i5-7600 is priced around $213, and the unlocked i5-7600K sells for around $242. The cheaper Intel chips outperform the 1600X in quite a few games, although they get beat in some CPU-intensive titles.
AMD's pricing isn't very disruptive, especially considering that Ryzen 5 is at a disadvantage when it comes to everyday tasks that benefit from better single-threaded performance. The 1600X is certainly a viable alternative to Intel's chips, but it comes with a lot of trade-offs and a higher price. If AMD's goal is to win back considerable market share from Intel, it will likely need to do better than this.

            ","When it comes to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), all eyes are on the company's efforts to reassert itself in the CPU and GPU markets. Ryzen, AMD's new line of PC CPUs, has already debuted, and Naples, the company's upcoming server chip, will arrive in the second quarter. Also coming soon is Vega, AMD's latest effort to wrest the high-end GPU market away from NVIDIA.
These new products are the reason AMD stock has exploded over the past year, up more than 400%. But AMD's most important business right now, and what has kept it afloat over the past few years as it plotted its comeback, is the semi-custom segment. Not only has this segment produced more revenue than the core business in each of the past two years, but its profitability has also partially subsidized AMD's flailing CPU and GPU businesses.
This situation may reverse if AMD's new products pick up some market share, but at the moment the semi-custom business is where AMD makes most of its money.

AMD's semi-custom business was born along with Sony's PlayStation 4, which launched in 2013. The eight-core semi-custom system on chip (SoC) AMD designed for the console was its first foray into the world of designing a custom chip for a specific customer. Microsoft also turned to AMD for a similar design for the Xbox One, putting the company in a position to benefit from a strong game console cycle.
According to VGChartz, 86.4 million PS4 and Xbox One consoles have been sold worldwide since launch, with each sale bringing in some revenue for AMD. Higher-end versions of both consoles -- the PlayStation 4 Pro and the Xbox One S -- launched last year using updated versions of AMD's SoCs. This provided a midcycle boost for AMD.
The semi-custom segment, which also includes server and embedded processors, generated $2.31 billion of revenue in 2016, up from $2.19 billion in 2015. With AMD's server chip market share essentially zero prior to the launch of Naples, the semi-custom business is responsible for the vast majority of this revenue. AMD's core business, the computing and graphics segment, which includes both PC CPUs and GPUs, managed revenue of just $1.97 billion last year.
The semi-custom segment is also AMD's most profitable segment, aided by the fact that its semi-custom chips are built with technology that was already developed for the core business. Semi-custom segment operating income was $283 million in 2016, up from $215 million in 2015. Meanwhile, the computing and graphics segment posted an operating loss of $238 million in 2016, an improvement from an abysmal $502 million loss in 2015.
As the current console generation matures, a decline in revenue derived from game consoles is inevitable. AMD does have another design win up its sleeve: Microsoft's Project Scorpio game console set to launch this year. But AMD will need some major non-game console deals to fully offset the eventual decline. AMD has previously disclosed that it had secured one non-gaming semi-custom design win, but details have been scarce.
AMD's new CPU and GPU products come at the perfect time, able to offset any revenue declines in the semi-custom business. The high-end variants of Ryzen have already launched, and while reviews were mixed, it's clear that AMD is now in a much-improved competitive position. Naples and Vega still have a lot of unknowns, but even modest market share gains in the server CPU and GPU markets can produce meaningful revenue growth for AMD.
The game consoles will continue to account for a significant amount of AMD's revenue for the next few years. There's no guarantee that the next generation of game consoles includes AMD chips, though, creating a risk that a big chunk of revenue disappears at some point down the line. The recently launched Nintendo Switch is powered by a custom Tegra SoC from NVIDIA, and Sony and Microsoft will have more options the next time around than they did when the PS4 and Xbox One launched.
A year or two from now, AMD's core business will likely be the star of the show, assuming its product launches find some success. But for now, the semi-custom business is the most important part of AMD.

            ","The stock market gained ground on Thursday, but the rise in major market benchmarks was modest at best. The Dow finished up just 15 points after having been higher by as much as 100 points earlier in the session, as investors appeared to grow more cautious despite ongoing signs of economic strength domestically. Many market participants looked at the critical meeting between political leaders of the U.S. and China in Florida as an indicator of future trade relations and potential geopolitical conflict going forward.
Yet even though the market was relatively comfortable with the day's events, some stocks weren't as lucky. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Banco Santander Brasil (NYSE:BSBR) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices dropped 6% after getting a poor rating from analysts at Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street behemoth initiated coverage of the chipmaker with a sell rating, setting a price target of $11 per share, which remains more than 15% below current levels even after today's drop. Analysts argued that AMD's success is unlikely to last because of potential competitive threats from other major players in the space, and Goldman believes that the current share price assumes that AMD will be particularly effective in claiming key wins in the years to come. Anything short of that rosy scenario could hurt the stock, and investors seemed inclined to agree, based on today's trading. That said, even with the drop today, AMD stock is up by more than 400% from its worst levels over the past year, giving longtime investors plenty of gains despite the pullback.

Plug Power stock fell 5%, retreating only very slightly from the better-than-70% gains that the fuel cell specialist enjoyed in Wednesday's session. Those gains stemmed from an agreement that Plug Power made with online retail giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to use fuel-cell and hydrogen-powered equipment and technology in its fulfillment network. In particular, Plug expects to sell its GenKey charging systems to make Amazon's operations more energy-efficient and cut related costs. Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh termed the deal ""a tremendous opportunity for Plug Power to further innovate and grow while helping to support the work Amazon does to pick, pack, and ship customer orders,"" and even those investors who made a lot of money in the stock's run-up on Wednesday chose not to take too much of their profits, anticipating even bigger future gains.
Finally, shares of Banco Santander Brasil fell 6%. The Brazilian unit of the financial giant is having to endure the sale of a portion of a major shareholder's stake in the company, with Qatar Investment Authority's sale of 80 million units of the bank expected to fetch prices that were below what most of those following the stock had hoped to see. Some believe that the hesitation among buyers in the offering stems from the impressive gains that the Brazilian financial institution's shares have seen over the past year and half, which have amounted to a doubling of the stock price. Predictably, the stock has lost ground since the Qatari sovereign wealth fund announced the offering, but once it's complete, some expect Banco Santander Brasil to return to solid performance as long as the Brazilian economy remains on a recovery track.

            ","There are stocks that outperform the market, and then there are some that absolutely crush it, catching investors off guard. It gets even more interesting when stocks that didn't appear too promising end up with market-thumping returns, somewhat like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and United Rentals (NYSE:URI), as our contributors explain below. 
Tim Green (Advanced Micro Devices): I suggested last April that shares of AMD, then trading for less than $3 per share, could soar if investor sentiment toward the stock improved. That's exactly what happened, to a surprising degree. AMD stock is now up more than 400% from the date of that article.

AMD has yet to produce results that justify all of the optimism now surrounding the stock. Its mainstream Polaris graphics cards were launched last year, but the company still produced an adjusted net loss of $117 million. Investors are betting that AMD's 2017 product launches, which include Ryzen PC CPUs, Naples server CPUs, and Vega high-end GPUs, will finally return it to the black. They very well may, but with a market capitalization of nearly $14 billion and sales of just $4.3 billion, anything short of significant market share gains will prove disappointing.
The company has only launched the highest-end Ryzen CPUs so far this year, with lower-end versions, Naples, and Vega still to come. Whether AMD remains a winning stock in 2017 depends on how these products fare. The high-end Ryzen 7 series received mixed reviews, praised for its multicore performance but criticized for its gaming performance. If all of AMD's launches this year are mixed bags, the euphoria surrounding the stock could fade away.
Neha Chamaria (United Rentals): Who'd think a company that's into a business as boring as renting equipment out to the construction industry could see its stock double in one year? That's the story of United Rentals, one of the top three S&P 500 performers in the past year. As of this writing, United Rentals is up a staggering 113% in one year.
You can credit the presidential elections as the event that triggered the huge run-up in the rental company's stock. Or more specifically, President Donald Trump's campaign promises of rebuilding America's infrastructure, which, if acted on, should mean brisk business for United Rentals.
The fact that United Rentals crushed analysts' estimates of adjusted profits per share and credited ""broad-based demand"" for it when it reported its fourth-quarter numbers in January further fueled investors' optimism. CEO Michael Kneeland even went on to say that 2017 should be ""a year of notable growth"" for several reasons, including its acquisition of NES Rentals, improving consumer sentiment, and the ongoing strength in key leading indicators for the industry. At the same time, Kneeland didn't hesitate saying ""it's too early to call"" when referring to the optimism around a possible government infrastructure stimulus package.
So in a way, United Rentals' crazy run-up is surprising. The stock is highly susceptible to macro factors, and no one really knows how policies under Trump's administration will pan out. The company's net profits have hardly budged in the past couple of years, though it generated strong free cash flows last year. I wouldn't call United Rentals too pricey at 19 times trailing earnings, especially given its forward P/E estimate of only 14. United Rentals may not grow gangbusters, but it is clearly already on the growth track. That should keep the stock moving higher, just maybe not as much as in the past year.
Jordan Wathen (Facebook): When Facebook went public, I thought the only path to growth was squeezing more revenue from every user. The only way to do it, as far as I saw it, was to push more ads into every bit of content, killing the user experience. In short, I thought it would be impossible for Facebook to grow into its valuation -- there just weren't many levers left to pull.
I couldn't have been more wrong. Facebook's advertising revenue per user grew from $9.51 per user in the U.S. and Canada in the full year of 2011 to $19.28 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016. All in all, Facebook is generating about six times more revenue from its average U.S. and Canada user last year than it did prior to its IPO. The majority of the incremental revenue flows straight to the bottom line, resulting in rapidly growing profits.
Realistically, I missed a few things when I looked at Facebook. I missed how important mobile would be to getting its users more engaged, generating more ad impressions, and protecting Facebook from ad-blocker losses. I also missed just how much more room Facebook had to grow in terms of users, both acquired (Instagram and WhatsApp) and from organic growth. I comfort myself knowing that I only missed out on five-year returns of about 270% at the worst and more than 600% in the best case.

            ","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...
Shares of semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are in free fall this morning, knocked for a loop by a giant sell rating from Wall Street's Goldman Sachs. After closing at $14.17 on Wednesday, the stock fell as far as $12.83 in early Thursday trading -- so the ""good"" news here is that it's now down only 7%.
Here are three things you need to know about why.
Goldman Sachs' sell rating shocked AMD investors this morning. Image source: Getty Images.
Completely out of the blue, Goldman Sachs initiated AMD stock with a sell rating and an $11-per-share price target this morning. If the analyst is right about that, it means AMD investors stand to lose 22% in market capitalization on their AMD shares over the course of the next year.
Already, the stock is down 7% in response to Goldman's rating, suggesting worried investors are taking the analyst's warning to heart -- and don't want to stick around for more losses. But are those fears justified? Isn't Goldman's sell rating just one opinion in a sea of opinions about AMD?
At its heart, Goldman Sachs' sell rating is a valuation argument. Investors are betting on a big improvement in AMD's business as consumers warm to its line of Ryzen microprocessors, and they like its growing prospects in PC gaming, artificial intelligence, and computer deep learning. Many analysts who follow the stock believe that AMD will enjoy rapidly rising revenue (and profits) over the coming years.
On average, analysts quoted on S&P Global Market Intelligence are calling for AMD's revenue to grow nearly 50% over the next four years -- and for operating profits to grow 16-fold. But as explained in a write-up on TheFly.com this morning, Goldman believes the potential improvement in fundamentals has already been priced into the shares. As a result, while some appreciation in stock price may have been justified, now that the stock is up nearly five times in two years, the current risk-return profile is unfavorable.
Priced today at nearly 44 times next year's profits (i.e., profits AMD is not even guaranteed to earn), Goldman sees AMD's current stock price as ""difficult to justify.""
Most analysts on Wall Street expect to see AMD turn profitable as soon as next year (earning a GAAP $0.11 per share, and $0.25 pro forma). Goldman, however, warns that that's a ""very bullish"" view -- and likely not to be correct given pricing pressure from even larger semiconductor powerhouses Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Goldman's best guess? NVIDIA will earn only $0.14 per share pro forma next year, which implies an actual, GAAP profit of zero dollars, zero cents.
And Goldman Sachs' argument makes sense. As the analyst explains it, there's certainly a possibility that AMD will succeed in winning market share this year with its powerful Ryzen chips. But even if it does succeed, then Intel and NVIDIA would probably try to lead customers back to the fold by offering price concessions on their own chips.
The result would be short-term revenue gains for AMD, followed by margin compression on that revenue later in 2017 and heading into 2018 as the company is forced to cut its own prices to fend off competition from Intel and NVIDIA. So what would that portend for AMD investors?
According to S&P Global data, AMD hasn't succeeded in posting a full-year profit since 2011, a year in which its operating profit margin surpassed 7%. Currently, that margin is coming in just shy of negative 9%. So while it's possible it will improve for a quarter or two, the end result of the moves AMD's rivals would make to counteract its gains in market share would likely plunge AMD's profit margin right back into a bath of red ink -- and deny the company the ability to report a profit in 2018.
Investors betting on a return to GAAP profitability at AMD may have to wait a bit longer to see it.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trying to take the game to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in server chips with its Naples platform. However, this is easier said than done as Intel owns the server-chip market hands down with a market share of over 90%. In fact, its dominance in this market is so absolute that the chip giant's products accounted for 99.3% of server chip shipments in the third quarter of 2016.
AMD, therefore, needed to come up with a game-changing product before even thinking of shaking Intel's vice-like grip over this market. But it believes that its Naples high-performance server processor is capable enough to unsettle the market leader.
AMD previewed its Naples server processor in the first week of March. It showed a product packed with high-end specs to gain a performance advantage over Intel. The company claims that the Naples architecture has 45% more cores and 122% more bandwidth memory than its competitor.

This competitor is none other than Intel, and AMD made that clear by demonstrating the capabilities of its platform against Intel's fastest server offering, a 2-socket Xeon chip, in a number of scenarios involving seismic analysis that's used to locate natural-resource deposits. Not surprisingly, AMD Naples was the faster chip in all the scenarios.
As it turns out, AMD Naples can process a workload two times faster than the Intel Xeon when both are running the same number of cores and identical memory bandwidth. The performance gain jumps to 2.5 times when Naples runs more cores and a higher memory bandwidth.
AMD's strategy of bringing a more powerful chip indicates that it could do better on the performance front, though we would have to wait for the actual results as Naples will be launched in the second quarter. This is why investors should take the faster benchmark performance with a grain of salt until and unless independent tests establish Naples' supremacy over Intel's product.
AMD has a pretty solid reason for going against Intel to tap the server-chip market with a solution that has superior specs. The global market for data-center servers could grow at an annual pace of 4.89% until 2021, according to Technavio's Data Center Server Market report. This should create a stronger demand for server chips as they play a mission-critical role of enabling fast data transfer over the network in data centers.
Now, an explosion of data will drive data-center workloads higher. The Cisco Global Cloud Index projects that traffic related to cloud data centers will jump a whopping 262% in 2020 from 2015 levels, with 92% of the workload being processed in the cloud. This is where AMD's Naples will come into play, as it seems capable of handling more workload due to higher specifications if the benchmarks are taken at face value.
What's more, modular data centers can also use AMD's server chips to tackle the growing workload as they provide incremental capacity to the existing infrastructure, apart from being used in remote areas. This could be a big deal for AMD as Markets and Markets expects the modular data-center infrastructure market to grow threefold by the end of the decade.
AMD, however, is not going to have a free run given Intel's near-monopoly in this space, as the latter won't wait for its rivals to eat into its market share. Additionally, Intel's response to AMD's potential threat is yet to come, which could make the game interesting if the company comes out with a more powerful offering.
But Intel needs to be on its toes because the high-performance Naples platform could help AMD carve out a small piece of the server-chip market for itself as it solves the problem of greater workloads in data centers.

            ","If it weren't already obvious that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is moving deeper into the data center, now we have it in black and white. The rickety PC market is not a strategic focus anymore, but heavy-duty number crunching is.
The strategic shift was stated in plain English this week, baked into an announcement that longtime vice president Aicha Evans will be shouldering the newly created title of Intel's chief strategy officer.

From the announcement, with the key portion highlighted in italics:
""She will be responsible for driving Intel's long-term strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, as well as leading rapid decision making and companywide execution of the strategy.""
Intel's chief strategy officer, Aicha Evans. Image source: Intel.
There you have it. Evans is tasked with moving Intel away from the floundering PC market and into the vibrant data analysis sector. The shift is companywide and needs to be done quickly.
The plainspoken statement comes just weeks after Intel started launching its $15.3 billion acquisition of automotive computing specialist Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). In August of 2016, the company picked up data processing specialist Nervana, which designs hyper-specialized chips for artificial intelligence, data analysis, and deep-learning systems. Those are just two of the most high-profile moves Intel has made toward the data center market lately. The full list is much longer.
Intel rivals NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are exploring the same strategic direction from their own unique angles, unlocking a ton of shareholder value in the process. NVIDIA shares have tripled over the last year as the company's latest generation of graphics processors was embraced by big-iron system builders and moved into the data center. AMD's equally fresh graphics platform is taking the same tack, yielding a nearly 400% shareholder return in 52 weeks.
The data center is at the heart of Intel's traditional hunting grounds, and the company won't stand for smaller rivals stepping in to steal all of the thunder. The Nervana buyout is a direct attack on NVIDIA and AMD, and Aicha Evans will make sure to drive that point home.
We Intel shareholders can't expect the stock to double or triple overnight, of course. It's an industry giant, poised to strike at much smaller challengers. It takes more work to move Intel's larger business needle.
But the writing is on the wall: Intel is going there with a focused purpose and high speed.
AMD and NVIDIA must have seen this coming from miles away, but their investors should still be shaking in their boots.

            ","Many semiconductor stocks surged in 2016, thanks to rising demand for chips across multiple industries. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks many of the top names in the sector, rallied almost 50% over the past 12 months. 
But despite that robust performance, some semiconductor stocks could rise even further this year. Let's take a look at three chip plays that still have room to run: Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).
Image source: Getty Images.
Xilinx is the largest maker of FPGA (field programmable gate array) chips in the world. These chips can be reprogrammed after being installed, making them well suited for a wide variety of machines -- including servers, connected cars, smart appliances, and airplanes. FPGAs are usually paired with traditional CPUs to handle industry-specific tasks. That's why Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) acquired Xilinx's only meaningful rival, Altera, in late 2015.
That acquisition made Xilinx -- which launched 16nm chips a year before Intel caught up with 14nm ones -- a rumored takeover target for larger chipmakers like Qualcomm. The Altera acquisition also convinced Intel's chipmaking rivals, like Qualcomm and IBM, to pair their CPUs with Xilinx's FPGAs to match Intel's new programmable capabilities.
Wall Street expects Xilinx's revenue and earnings to respectively grow 6% and 11% this year. It pays a forward dividend yield of 2.3%, and it's raised that payout annually for six straight years. Xilinx's P/E of 25 is a bit higher than its industry average of 22, but its growing network of partnerships and attractiveness as a takeover target shouldn't be ignored.
Micron is often more volatile than other semiconductor stocks because demand for its DRAM and NAND memory chips is cyclical. Demand for those chips was sluggish throughout most of 2016, due to a slowdown in PC sales, the commoditization of the mobile device market, and a glut of memory chips crushing market prices. 
Image source: Micron.
However, those trends reversed in late 2016, as many device makers reported shortages of memory chips and rising prices. That's why Micron posted double-digit sales growth over the past two quarters, which ended six straight quarters of annual declines. Analysts expect Micron's revenue to rise 57% this year and for its non-GAAP earnings to surge from $0.06 to $2.42. 
Micron rallied more than 170% over the past 12 months, but it trades at just six times forward earnings -- indicating that the market remains pretty bearish on its chances (I'd argue that it's overly bearish). However, investors should beware of two major headwinds. First, competition from larger players like Samsung and Western Digital's SanDisk could still put pressure on Micron's margins. Second, Micron warned that Chinese chipmakers could flood the memory market with cheap chips in the near future, which could push Micron into a downward cycle again.
AMD's upside potential might seem limited after rising nearly 400% over the past 12 months. Yet investors shouldn't ignore the chipmaker's compelling comeback story. After years of being squeezed in x86 CPUs by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and high-end GPUs by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD carved out a growing niche in EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) chipsets for gaming consoles and other devices.
Image source: AMD.
That move enabled AMD to post three straight quarters of positive year-over-year sales growth -- which broke a two-year streak of top-line declines. Analysts expect AMD's revenue to rise 11% this year and for it to achieve non-GAAP profitability again following multiple years of net losses. 
As for AMD's valuation, its EV/sales ratio of 3.1 remains comparable to Intel's ratio of three and much lower than NVIDIA's ratio of 8.6.
Besides gaming consoles, AMD plans to turn up the heat on NVIDIA with more low-end VR-ready GPUs and its next-gen Vega GPUs. It also plans to strike back at Intel with its new Ryzen chips, which offer comparable performance as Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake chips at lower price points. Those efforts could lift AMD to new highs, but the stock could also plunge if demand for these chips falls short of expectations.
Xilinx, Micron, and AMD could all climb higher this year, but each of these companies face clear risks -- Xilinx faces upcoming FPGA battles with Intel, Micron faces challenges from bigger chipmakers, and AMD must land some meaningful blows against Intel and NVIDIA to maintain is momentum. Therefore, investors should carefully weigh these pros and cons before buying any of these semiconductor stocks.

            ","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has enjoyed a near-monopoly in the server chip market in recent years, with a market share of roughly 99%. Its x86 chips are the standard, and without any real competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), the only other x86 chip maker, Intel has been free to enjoy its dominance.
Operating margin in Intel's data center segment has routinely topped 50%, and the growth of cloud computing has driven both revenue and profits higher. During 2016, the data center segment generated $17.2 billion of revenue and a whopping $7.5 billion of operating income.
Image source: Intel.
The company is now warning that data center growth will slow and margins will contract, reflecting a return of competition to the server chip market and its plan to bring server chips to new process nodes before PC chips. Intel expects sales of its server CPUs to grow by just 6% annually through 2021, and for its data center operating margin to drop to the low- to mid- 40% range.
These lower estimates may not be pessimistic enough. Intel faces three distinct threats in the data center, all of which could eat away at its market share and its margins.
AMD's server chip business has been insignificant for quite some time. The company was once a major force, with a roughly 26% unit share of the x86 server chip market in 2006. But it has been outclassed by Intel ever since, driving its market share down near zero.
AMD will make its return to the server chip market later this year when it launches Naples, server chips built on its Zen architecture. AMD has already launched Ryzen, the PC version of Zen, and while reviews have been mixed, AMD has significantly closed its performance gap with Intel. AMD still can't compete when it comes to single-threaded performance, but Ryzen's copious cores and competitive pricing make the chips a clear winner for certain workloads.
Naples will come with up to 32 cores, and AMD is touting memory bandwidth and input/output capacity as the key selling points. Compared to a comparable Intel Xeon chip, AMD claims that Naples will have 45% more cores, 60% more I/O capacity, and 122% more memory bandwidth. If Ryzen is any indication, Naples will certainly be superior for some workloads, but it's unlikely to best Intel in general.
Still, Naples should make AMD a player in the server chip market once again, forcing Intel to compete for the first time in years. Exactly how much market share AMD will be able to win is anyone's guess, but it's all downside for Intel.
Beyond AMD and x86 chips, there are two other threats to Intel's server chip monopoly. ARM chips are finally making their way to the data center, with Microsoft recently announcing that its Project Olympus server design now supports both x86 and ARM chips. The company is already testing ARM chips from Qualcomm and Cavium for search, storage, and machine learning, and it has created a version of Windows Server for ARM processors.
Microsoft isn't the only cloud computing company looking to lower its dependence on Intel. Alphabet's Google announced last year that it was developing an open server architecture that supports the upcoming POWER9 processor from IBM. Google's toolchain fully supported POWER at the time of the announcement, allowing the company to use POWER processors in conjunction with chips from Intel.
The push from the major cloud infrastructure providers to support different architectures isn't surprising. Shifting from a world where Intel is the only option to a world where there are a multitude of options will surely bring server chip prices down, allowing cloud computing to get cheaper and further eat into the traditional server market.
The glory days of Intel's server chip empire are coming to an end. The data center segment will continue to throw off plenty of cash for Intel, but market share and margins are going to take a hit. It's impossible to predict exactly how much share Intel will lose, or how far its margins will fall. But it's safe to say that Intel's server chip monopoly isn't long for this world.

            ","After a strong showing late last week as the Federal Reserve opted to increase interest rates, the stock market was mostly flat on Monday, with major indexes fluctuating between positive and negative territory. But amid a flurry of encouraging analyst notes, there were a few individual companies that managed to buck the trend, and shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among those stocks that delivered outsized gains today. Let's take a closer look at what drove these unusual moves.
Shares of AMD climbed more than 7% as two optimistic analysts chimed in regarding the prospects of the company's new Ryzen 7 chips. First, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated his buy rating on AMD stock, but also increased his per-share price target to $16 from $13. To justify his bullishness, Lipacis noted AMD's Ryzen 7 (which was launched on March 2, 2017) and Ryzen 5 (which will be available on April 11, 2017) processors should help the company take significant market share considering they offer comparable performance and more attractive pricing than similar chips from Intel. Lipacis further cited the potential for further share gains and revenue growth to come from the launch of AMD's more affordable Ryzen 3 processors later this year, noting they believe the company is still ""in the early innings of its multi-year turnaround story.""
And AMD received more love in a separate note today from Susquehenna's Christopher Rolland, who maintained his own neutral rating on the stock but similarly increased his per-share price target to $12 from $9. Rolland outlined his belief that AMD is likely to exceed Wall Street's consensus revenue expectations in the coming quarter thanks to the Ryzen line's ongoing rollout, especially as sales to larger PC original equipment manufacturers like HP and Dell should commence as early as next month.

Meanwhile, after falling 27% over the past two weeks, shares of Snapchat parent Snap Inc. climbed as much as 4.7% -- but settled to gains of 2% at market close -- after the stock received its first buy rating, courtesy of Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak. 
More specifically, Cakmak initiated coverage on Snap stock with a buy rating and price target of $25 per share, a healthy premium over Snap's current price just shy of $20 per share. But while Cakmak believes Snap should continue to outgrow its competition, he appeared to temper his enthusiasm by stating, ""We recognize we are potentially giving too much credit for unproven skills in building a business, rather than just a product, but we see more to Snap than many suggest.""
With Snap shares having given up much of their initial gains following the company's IPO earlier this month, it's not terribly surprising to see Wall Street taking notice.
Finally, shares of NVIDIA jumped more than 3% on the day as Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated the graphics chip specialist's status on his firm's ""Conviction Buy"" list with a $130-per-share price target. Tari technically didn't boost his already positive opinion of NVIDIA, but he did express admiration for the importance of NVIDIA's off-the-shelf machine learning models and customer support after attending NVIDIA's Deep Learning Connect event in London last week.
Moreover, Hari believes NVIDIA's planned strategic investments in the automotive, data center, and enterprise markets should be able to drive results similar to its successful core gaming segment. So even with shares having more than tripled over the past year, the analyst believes NVIDIA shares should have plenty more room to run.

            ","The first batch of Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) Ryzen PC CPUs launched on March 2 to mixed reviews. The Ryzen 7 series, all high-end chips aimed at competing with Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) best, offers impressive performance in applications capable of utilizing all eight cores. For the price, especially considering that Intel's 6-10 core Broadwell-E chips are extremely expensive, Ryzen 7 looks like a great choice for workstation and professional applications.
But Ryzen 7 fell short in applications where single-threaded performance mattered. While AMD's new chips offer a massive leap in performance over the previous generation, they're still no match for Intel in situations where more cores provide little to no benefit. Gaming is the most prominent example, with third-party reviews putting Intel's cheaper four-core i7-7700k ahead of even the most expensive Ryzen chip in nearly every gaming benchmark.
AMD will have another shot to impress gamers in April. The company plans to launch four mainstream Ryzen 5 CPUs on April 11, priced to compete with Intel's own mainstream offerings. While Ryzen 7 was meant to turn heads with its impressive multicore performance, Ryzen 5 may end up being more disruptive.
Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
AMD's Ryzen 5 chips will be priced between $169 and $249, comprised of two hex-core and two quad-core options. The $249 hex-core 1600X, essentially a Ryzen 7 1800X with two cores disabled, will be the most expensive, roughly the same price as Intel's i5-7600K. The $219 1600 will also feature six cores, but a lower clock speed will slow it down. The $189 1500X and $169 1400 will both come with four cores, going after Intel's lower-end offerings.
Independent third-party reviews are still weeks away, but it's safe to say that Ryzen 5 will wipe the floor with comparably priced Intel chips in scenarios that benefit from more cores. AMD claims that the 1600X beats Intel's 7600K by 69% in a cherrypicked multicore benchmark, not a surprise given that it has 50% more cores and triple the threads.
Single-threaded performance will still be an issue, just as it was with Ryzen 7. But the 1600X could end up far more attractive for PC gamers due to the lower price. While multithreaded performance will be worse than its high-end eight-core siblings, gaming performance shouldn't be too far off from the 1800X in many games. The gaming performance that the 1800X delivers isn't worth its $499 price tag. But a $249 price tag is a different story.
We'll have to wait and see how these new chips perform against Intel's products. If the 1600X provides similar gaming performance as the highest-end Ryzen chip, it will certainly shake up the mainstream PC CPU market. It will be no match in terms of raw single-threaded performance for Intel's more expensive i7-7700K, but the price-to-performance ratio could make the 1600X a popular chip.
AMD will further fill out its CPU lineup during the second half of the year with its Ryzen 3 line of low-end products. With prices topping out below $169 and likely featuring only quad-core chips, perhaps even dual-core chips, Ryzen 3 will be aimed at Intel's budget offerings.
Ryzen so far has been a mixed bag. There's no question that AMD has accomplished a lot, greatly improving performance over its previous line of chips. AMD claims that Ryzen achieves 52% higher instructions-per-clock, a measure of single-threaded performance, an impressive feat. But that gain also reflects how abysmal single-threaded performance has been on AMD chips in recent years.
Intel likely won't sit still if AMD begins to win considerable market share, so there's no guarantee that Ryzen will lead to the kind of profits that investors are expecting. AMD stock is up about 375% over the past year, reflecting a fervent optimism that may end up being a bit too intense. Ryzen is a big step forward for AMD, but whether it will be enough to justify those gains remains to be seen.

            ","Warren Buffet famously said that the best time to sell a stock is never. While not even the Oracle of Omaha strictly adheres to that rule, investors still should have an appropriately long time horizon for the companies they put their money into. At least three to five years is a minimum; a decade is better, and decades is best.
Still, when companies make huge moves in a short period of time, it's worthwhile to see what the catalysts were that caused them to explode in value. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Chemours (NYSE:CC), and KEMET (NYSE:KEM) are three stocks that soared in value over the past year so that had you invested $3,000 in any one of them, you'd be looking at a $15,000 gain -- or better! Let's see why they made the moves they did.
Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
It was a long time coming, but Advanced Micro Devices posted its first adjusted profits in 2016. The last time the chipmaker was in the black, at least on a non-GAAP basis, was 2011, and after wandering in the wilderness for so long, it was a welcome homecoming.
The basis for the gains was its ability to carve out a niche supplying chips for the gaming industry as the PC business declined. Early on in 2016, it signed a deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment to license server chip designs for new processors for gaming consoles from Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, and it has recognized $88 million from the deal so far.
A lot of the sentiment in favor of AMD has depended on the ability of its Polaris, Vega, and Ryzen (aka Zen) architectures to gain share in the GPU and CPU markets, as well as sign more IP licensing deals with customers. By doing so, it has once again emerged as a competitive second source to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which it's planning to challenge with its new Ryzen processors and Naples server chips.  
However, the company is also reportedly willing to partner with its rival in a bid to take on NVIDIA. It will reportedly feature Intel's CPUs alongside its own GPUs in what can only be described as a case of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend.""
There's still a lot of ground for Advanced Micro Devices to make up, but that seems to bode well for further gains in its stock, which has risen from well under $3 a share in March 2016 to over $14 a stub today. The 436% gain would have turned $3,000 into more than $16,000 in just one year.
Image source: Chemours. 
Spun off from DuPont (NYSE:DD) in 2015, performance chemicals specialist Chemours was seen as set up for failure from the beginning, with lots of debt and toxic assets its former parent wanted to shield itself from. The titanium dioxide market that had bolstered the balance sheets of DuPont, Dow Chemical, Kronos Worldwide, and Huntsman, the world's four largest producers of the white pigment, also imploded.
However, though it initially lost 85% of its value in its first seven months as a separate company, Chemours has gone on to be a star performer. It did so by cutting expenses and its workforce, and by shedding or shutting non-core assets. In 2016, Chemours reduced costs by $200 million, improved operating cash flows by $412 million, and retired $385 million in long-term debt. While the TiO2 business it inherited from DuPont is still weak, the performance chemicals leader was still able to raise prices last year, showing it still possesses substantial power in the industry and allowing it to more than double its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margins to $157 million.
Shares of Chemours have gone from less than $7 each to over $33, a better than 400% gain that would have transformed $3,000 into more than $15,000. It still has some substantial risks ascribed to it, but it's a much better business than it was when it first hit the public markets.
Image source: KEMET.
The world's largest manufacturer of solid tantalum capacitors and one of the biggest makers of multilayer ceramic capacitors used across automotive, communications, and military and aerospace industries, KEMET has been on the rise since the November elections, perhaps on the promise by President Trump of increased infrastructure spending that would dwarf the stimulus spending package of his predecessor.
However, last month, KEMET's stock surged nearly 23% in one day after announcing it was acquiring NEC TOKIN, a Japanese manufacturer of tantalum capacitors, in which it had already owned a substantial stake. While the purchase brings new capabilities under KEMET's purview and enhances existing lines, there seems to be little reason for the outsized gains the deal generated.
When KEMET originally took a stake in TOKIN, regulators had no problem signing off on the deal because there were no competitive concerns raised, and it would only increase KEMET's market share incrementally. Of course, that was a few years ago, and now KEMET will own the entire company, but the playing field does appear to have been significantly altered to warrant the outsized gain.
Even so, KEMET's stock is up 440% over the past year, most of it since November, when it went from trading around $3.60 per share to today, where it stands north of $11 a share. That would mean it would have turned $3,000 into more than $16,000. Considering it had been trading sideways for much of 2016, those gains have largely occurred in about just four months' time, making its compounded growth rate really much larger.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a fantastic water cooler stock these days. The ticker sports enormous trading volumes and equally impressive amounts of investor chatter, and all for good reason: AMD shares have gained an outrageous 440% over the last 52 weeks, producing huge returns for investors.
But maybe it's time to redirect some of those AMD profits into a different stock. If you love AMD's stock and business plan, you should probably take a closer look at Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) right now.
Image source: Getty Images.
Broadcom is one of the largest semiconductor businesses in the world. Since the $37 billion merger with Avago in 2016, the company has been an undisputed leader in important sectors such as wired and wireless network tools, data storage controllers, and automotive computing.
The company is both diverse and strictly focused, picking its target markets with meticulous precision and selling off unwanted operations. For example, Broadcom sold its wireless Internet of Things (IoT) product portfolio last summer to smaller rival Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY), collecting a $550 million check while sharpening its business focus. IoT networking is a promising growth market, but could also serve as a distraction from Broadcom's core business operations -- so off to Cypress went the division.
It's a growth story in progress, with strong narratives for the top and bottom lines -- as well as shareholder returns. Broadcom was actually smaller than AMD in many ways just a few years ago, but has worked its way up:

AVGO Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
Past performance is not the same as future returns, of course. No one can guarantee that Broadcom's positive long-term trends will continue forever. On the other hand, the same dictum also applies to AMD's recent surge.
Let's be clear about this: AMD is a turnaround story, searching for traction in highly competitive markets. Recent technology updates led to strong sales in both the graphics processor and desktop/notebook markets, giving the company and its investors a welcome break from a long string of failures and disappointments.
That huge one-year price surge started from the bottom of a deep trough. Share prices had been sliced in half over the previous two years, diving 30% lower in 52 weeks. Even now, after that huge bounce, AMD's five-year returns and results pale in comparison to Broadcom's steady improvements:

AVGO data by YCharts.
Buying AMD now is a gamble. You're betting that the company's turnaround efforts will continue to pay off in the face of high-quality competition and a poor track record. Current share prices are built on hopes and dreams and flimsy financials.
Broadcom offers a large and stable financial platform, from which the company launches forays into highly targeted markets. This company is an established leader with a top-notch management team, producing annual cash flows roughly the size of AMD's total revenue.

            ","NVIDIA claims the GTX 1080 Ti is 35% faster than the TITAN X Pascal-based GPU, which is used for deep learning and artificial intelligence. It's priced at $699 -- about half the cost of the TITAN X's $1,200 price tag.
NVIDIA holds a commanding lead in the gaming GPU market. Image source: NVIDIA. 
One way NVIDIA is able to design its latest gaming GPUs to run faster than TITAN X is through advanced cooling solutions, which allows the GTX 1080 Ti, for example, to run at higher clock speeds while dissipating heat more efficiently.
The GTX 1080 Ti packs plenty of horsepower to run the latest games smoothly on 4K and 5K resolution displays. The new graphics card was also designed to power virtual reality (VR) games. It is important for NVIDIA to hold its lead in being the card of choice for gamers, because gaming is NVIDIA's largest revenue category. 
NVIDIA's gaming revenue grew 44% in fiscal 2017 to $4.06 billion, fueled by gamer adoption of new GPUs that feature the latest Pascal card design. Strong demand should continue, as the majority of PC gamers have not upgraded to a Pascal GPU yet. According to CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA has an installed GeForce user base of ""a couple of 100 million."" As to how far along in the upgrade cycle those users are, he said:
We've upgraded about two quarters of them, as in two operating quarters out of four years. It takes about three to four years to upgrade the entire installed base. And we started ramping Pascal, as you know, a few quarters ago. And our data would suggest that the upgrade cycle is going well, and we have plenty to go.
Gamers are enthusiastic to get their hands on the $700 GTX 1080 Ti; it sold out quickly on NVIDIA's website. Valve Corporation's recent Steam Hardware Survey updated for February shows gamers rapidly adopting Pascal-based GPUs such as the GTX 1070 and GTX 1060. Steam is one of the most popular PC gaming distribution platforms. Here's the percentage of Steam users who use either the GTX 1060 or GTX 1070 model for each month going back to October:
Data source: February Steam hardware survey. 
The launch of the new GTX 1080 Ti at the $699 price point allowed the company to lower the price of the GTX 1080 by $100, which should assist the upgrade cycle and could help the company hold its top market share position. 
The launch of the new GPU is significant for NVIDIA as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gets set to debut its new Vega GPU in the second quarter of 2017. The new Vega GPUs will target gaming enthusiasts as well as data centers, competing head-to-head with NVIDIA's GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti. Early reports suggest AMD's upcoming Vega GPU is 10% faster than NVIDIA's GTX 1080.
AMD has lost considerable market share to NVIDIA in the last few years, making 2017 a pivotal year in the high-end GPU market. The latest data from Jon Peddie Research shows NVIDIA holding 70.5% share of the discrete GPU market. This is way ahead of AMD's 29.5% share. With the pre-emptive announcement of the GTX 1080 Ti, NVIDIA is not resting on its laurels.
As of now, NVIDIA is the card of choice for gamers. The company has successfully won the top market share spot by outmaneuvering the competition on performance and price. Under the leadership of CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA also positioned its GPU business to benefit from applications outside of gaming like deep learning and autonomous vehicles, leaving AMD in the dust in these areas.
On the flip side, AMD has kept itself afloat by supplying GPUs for Apple's 27-inch Retina iMac and MacBook Pro computers in order to ride the tide of the iPhone maker's strength in the PC market. AMD's mobile GPU shipments have been strong of late due to the launch of the Radeon Pro 400 GPU and demand for Apple's MacBook Pro notebooks.
NVIDIA's stock is priced for perfection, so any signs of competition creeping up on the company could send the stock tumbling. Therefore, the reaction from the gaming community to AMD's second-quarter launch of its new Vega GPU will be important for investors to watch.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) stock jumped 19.9% in February, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, mainly on the company's strong fourth-quarter 2016 earnings and full-year 2016 report.

AMD said its revenue hit $1.11 billion for the quarter, up 15% year over year, due to strong sales of the company's GPUs. Investors were also likely pleased to see the AMD's gross margin improve to 32%, a year-over-year increase of 2 percentage points.
Adding to the excitement was AMD's full-year revenue of $4.27 billion, up 7% from 2015. Net losses for the year subsided from $419 million in 2015 to just $117 million for the full-year 2016.
AMD managed to increase sales across all of its major segments in the fourth quarter, bumping up its revenue from its computing and graphics segment by 28% and improving enterprise, embedded and semi-custom revenue by 4%, both on a year-over-year basis.
On the company's earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su said, ""As we look back on 2016, we successfully accomplished our key priorities, including growing discrete graphic share led by Polaris GPU adoption [and] regaining client compute share led by our seventh generation APUs,"" and added that the company also reduced debt and increased its cash.
Su went on to say that as the company heads into 2017 it's seeing ""strong revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities"" from its Zen-based CPUs and Vega GPUs.""
AMD's stock has been riding very high as of late -- it's up 490% over the past 12 months -- and investors are still looking for more. Whether they'll get it or not remains to be seen. AMD's management said that for the first quarter of 2017, the company expects revenue to decrease by roughly 11% sequentially, though it would be an 18% year-over-year increase at the midpoint.
But AMD's full-year outlook still remains strong. Su said on the call, ""[B]ased on our current market expectations and the strength of our upcoming products, we are confident we can grow annual revenue, expand gross margin, and deliver non-GAAP net income in 2017.""

            ","Some of the best investments can be the most popular. On the other hand, getting caught up in the herd -- while ignoring what's actually happening with the business itself -- can be a surefire way to leave yourself with a smaller investment than you started with. 
Three of our top contributors have identified three stocks that are popular with investors right now but could also be poisonous to own. This includes computer-chip designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), small-in-size (but big-in-risk) biotech Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX), and mortgage REIT giant Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NYSE:NLY). 
Our contributors explain why these stocks are worth avoiding. Image source: Getty Images.
If you've been considering one of these stocks for your portfolio, make sure you've studied them closely. They may be popular, but they might also be toxic. 
Anders Bylund (Advanced Micro Devices): AMD sure fits the bill if you're looking for a popular stock. The chip designer inspires impressive volumes of online forum discussions, and daily trading volumes are downright crazy for a moderately sized midcap stock. This would be great if AMD were a fresh-faced upstart or a solid turnaround story in the making, and investors just couldn't help to share a near-certain ticket to big gains before the rally runs out of gas.
Unfortunately, that's not what AMD is offering here.
AMD's rocket-like run could end badly for investors. Image source: Getty Images.
Share prices have risen more than fivefold over the last year. AMD is trading at price-to-sales ratios comparable to larger rival Intel, and a much richer price-to-book ratio. Again, this could make sense if AMD sported profit margins in Intel's class, or superior growth trends. But Intel remains a stoutly profitable pillar of the semiconductor industry while AMD's profit margins have been negative for years.
Yes, AMD is doing many things right for the first time since dropping former CEO Dirk Meyer like a bad habit. Current leader, Lisa Su, has righted the sinking ship to some degree and AMD is turning out competitive chips these days. One of these days, the company might even turn a profit.
But that's still more of a gamble than an investment thesis. And either way, share prices have shot up into nosebleed territory with little support from actual business results.
Priced for absolute perfection, AMD must now deliver on every bit of the promises its new Ryzen and Polaris chip architectures have been making. All it takes is one manufacturing misstep, one equally fantastic product launch from a major rival, or one mistake at the negotiating table with PC builders -- and then the gains of 2016 could evaporate in a hurry.
Cory Renauer (Novavax, Inc.): Although small-cap biotech stocks can inflate your portfolio overnight, they also have a tendency to let the air out. Sticking to companies taking multiple shots on goal is a great way to protect yourself. Unfortunately, Novavax's safety net is practically nonexistent. It isn't isn't running any clinical trials with new drug candidates other than a once-failed experimental respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.
For decades efforts to develop a vaccine to prevent RSV have come up short, and it remains a leading cause of hospitalizations for infants and older adults. The first effective vaccine could generate billions in annual revenue and send Novavax's stock soaring.
Image source: Getty Images.
Unfortunately, Novavax's RSV candidate already stumbled once. The market hammered the stock last year after the company announced miserable late-stage trial results. In a trial with thousands of older adults, it failed to reduce the rate of infection versus a placebo.
The company had already started another large trial with pregnant women to see if it will lower infection rates of newborn infants through their first year. Positive results could lift the stock, but in the meantime, the company is quickly depleting its cash reserves. It ended 2016 with $235.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, after burning through $255.5 million last year.
Raising more equity to pay the bills would dilute shareholder value in the near term. Further out, another failure in the maternal immunization could be devastating. As much as I'd love to see the company succeed, it seems letting this stock into your portfolio could prove highly toxic.
Jason Hall (Annaly Capital Management, Inc.): Annaly Capital is as well-run a company as you'll find, and its 12-month dividend yield of nearly 11% at recent stock prices makes it incredibly appealing, and popular for investors chasing income. 
However, because of the way the company makes a living, investors should think twice before making a big bet that the dividend will be dependable going forward. Annaly Capital makes money on the spread between what it pays for capital when it takes on debt and what it can collect in interest on the assets -- largely residential and commercial real estate debt it buys with the capital. And it's looking more and more as if we're moving from a decades-long period of falling interest rates, which had been great for Annaly's ability to grow earnings (and its dividend), to a cycle of flat-to-rising rates. 
Annaly could turn into a yield trap soon. Image source: Getty Images.
And where this could be a problem for Annaly and other REITs that focus on owning debt is that its cost of capital could increase more quickly than the rates it will be able to collect, narrowing the ""spread"" it gets and cutting profits. Frankly, that's a big reason its stock is yielding so much today -- the market seems to expect this will catch up to Annaly sooner or later, and the dividend will get cut. 
If that happens, many of those income-chasing investors will quickly flee the stock and send it falling, adding the injury of capital losses to the insult of a slashed dividend. So before you rush into this potential dividend opportunity, don't discount the risk that it really is too good to be true.

            ","After a long wait, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has finally launched the first batch of its Ryzen CPUs. AMD is starting at the high end, launching three Ryzen 7 products aimed at ending Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) dominance in an area where AMD has been largely absent for years. The Ryzen 7 1700, 1700X, and 1800X, priced between $329 and $499, represent a major achievement for the company.
Ryzen has exceeded my expectations, which were not particularly high due to AMD's long history of coming up short of its own promises. The company has largely delivered with Ryzen, and this moment truly represents a turning point. However, those hoping for huge market share gains may need to temper their expectations. While Ryzen is the clear winner in applications that can make full use of its eight cores, gaming is another story.
Image source: AMD.
All three Ryzen 7 processors feature eight cores, double the typical number for desktop processors. Intel does sell some desktop chips with more than four cores, but those are priced at almost comical levels given Ryzen's pricing. Intel was able to price these chips so high because it faced absolutely no competition. That ends with Ryzen.
The consensus from the independent third-party reviews of Ryzen is clear. In applications that scale well with the number of cores, AMD's new chips are a home run. Intel's expensive Broadwell-E chips also do well, but Ryzen offers far higher performance per dollar.
There are some workstation use cases where Ryzen performs badly despite the extra cores. Tom's Hardware ran a litany of tests where Intel's i7-7700k, a quad-core chip priced at $349, handily beats out the most expensive Ryzen chip. The site points out that many of the applications are specifically optimized and compiled for Intel CPUs, giving Intel a major edge. This will presumably change once developers optimize for Ryzen, but it may put a damper on demand in the meantime.
In tests where optimization isn't an issue, the 1800X blows the 7700k out of the water. For those who routinely use workstation and professional applications that scale well the core count and that aren't specifically optimized for Intel CPUs, Ryzen has disrupted the market in a big way.
While Ryzen's eight cores bring increased performance in cases where they can be fully utilized, single-threaded performance remains a problem. AMD's previous generation of chips, which began with Bulldozer in 2011, were awful compared to Intel in terms of single-threaded performance. Ryzen closes the gap significantly, but it still falls short of Intel's best.
Tom's Hardware concludes that it's hard to recommend the 1800X over Intel's cheaper quad-core chips for gaming. GamersNexus calls it a hard pass for gaming. These high-end Ryzen chips are by no means bad for gaming. But they simply can't match Intel's 7700k.
The problem is that PC games generally can't take full advantage of eight cores. Performance doesn't scale nearly as well with the core count compared to other types of applications, and that leaves Ryzen at a disadvantage. This varies game to game, and some games do a better job than others. But in general, single-threaded performance matters for gaming. And that's exactly where Ryzen falls short.
Even in CPU-intensive games like Ashes of the Singularity, Tom's Hardware has the 7700k easily beating the 1800X at both 1080p and 1440p resolutions. The benchmarks AMD provided were done at a 4K resolution, which showed a much smaller gap. But the bottleneck at 4K is the GPU, so the performance gap between Ryzen and the 7700k is less visible.
For those whose main use case is gaming, there appears to be little reason to opt for a Ryzen chip over Intel's 7700k. The equation changes if applications that benefit from more cores are thrown into the mix, but as a gaming chip Ryzen disappoints. This will work against AMD as it aims to gain market share from Intel.
Overall, Ryzen is an important accomplishment for AMD. AMD is in a vastly better position with Ryzen compared to its previous generation of chips, and market share gains are almost guaranteed. Lower-end Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 chips are coming in the second quarter and the second half, respectively, which will fill out AMD's lineup and make the company more competitive than it's been in quite some time.

            ","The PC gaming hardware market exceeded $30 billion in revenue in 2016, up nearly 22% from the previous year, according to Jon Peddie Research. This growth in gaming hardware was surprising, as the industry was not expected to cross the $30 billion threshold until 2018.
Both NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) took advantage of this opportunity by ramping up their sales. The shift of the gaming hardware market toward mid-range and high-end graphics cards, along with an increase in their average selling prices, was a key catalyst for both these companies.
Mid-range gaming systems, for example, had 35% market share last year, compared to 31% in 2015. Meanwhile, high-end systems accounted for 43% of the market, while entry-level systems dropped to 22%. NVIDIA and AMD each launched new GPUs to take advantage of the growth, but the latter's focus on the mid-range segment gave it significant headway.
AMD offered the best GPUs for gamers on a budget in 2016, as its cards delivered excellent performance. This led to an increase in its market share in discrete GPUs. The last available data from Jon Peddie Research indicates that AMD had 29.5% of the discrete GPU market at the end of 2016 with NVIDIA commanding the remainder. By comparison, NVIDIA had over 78% of the market just a year ago, but AMD clawed back substantial share during the period.
As the gaming hardware market will clock annual growth of 6% through 2019, this sets the stage for the rivalry between the two industry leaders to continue.
Following its gains in mid-range GPUs, AMD is now going after the high-end segment as well. The company will release its Polaris successor -- the Vega -- in the second quarter of 2017 in a bid to shake the dominance of NVIDIA's GTX 1080.
Image Source: AMD.
AMD is expected to pack more computing power in the Vega GPUs and to price them competitively against NVIDIA's offerings. It will also add the Instinct line of accelerators to Vega GPUs to trump NVIDIA in terms of compute power in applications beyond gaming, such as machine intelligence.
Leaked benchmarks from multiple sources indicate  that AMD's MI8 and MI25 GPU accelerators are going to help the Vega outperform NVIDIA's Titan X in machine intelligence applications. The leaks indicate that the Instinct MI25 accelerator is said to be twice as fast as the NVIDIA Pascal X in deep learning benchmarks and will go head-to-head against NVIDIA's next GPU -- the GTX 1080 Ti.
Digital Trends reported NVIDIA is likely to price the GTX 1080Ti at around $900, as compared to the GTX 1080's base price of $600 and the Titan X's $1,200. On the other hand, the top of the line AMD Vega GPU is expected to come in at $800 to $1,200, while the competing GTX 1080 Ti should fall around $700. Strategic pricing will be critical to AMD's success in the high-end GPU space.
NVIDIA will fight back with its next-generation Volta architecture. Rumors suggest that NVIDIA's Pascal successor is expected to come out toward the end of 2017 or in early 2018.
Image Source: NVIDIA.
Though the specs of these Volta cards are not yet available, the company is reportedly going to employ Taiwan Semiconductor as its manufacturing partner, using a more efficient manufacturing process. The Volta should be based on a leaner 12 nanometer node versus the AMD Vega's 14 nanometer.
Theoretically, a smaller die shrink should deliver performance gains. GlobalFoundries, for instance, estimates that its 12nm process delivers 15% performance gains and consumes 50% less power than the 16nm process. NVIDIA will want to solidly outperform the Vega with its next-generation offerings.
But until the Volta hits shelves, AMD will have the opportunity to continue grabbing market share, extending the company's strong momentum from 2016.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is giving both NVIDIA and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) a run for their money, as the latest market share numbers for graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) indicate. Jon Peddie Research shows that AMD's overall GPU market share -- including both discrete and embedded graphics -- increased to 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. That is a gain of 2.6 percentage points from the prior-year period, outpacing both its peers.
Intel, meanwhile, saw its share decline 3.6 percentage points to 68.1% as consumers appear to gravitate towards powerful discrete GPUs over integrated units. The bad news for the market leader: Intel is not losing market share only in graphics processors.
Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
Mercury Research points out that AMD also gained on Intel in the CPU market. Its x86 processor market share increased to 13.6% from 12.7% in 2015. On the other hand, Intel saw its market share fall accordingly to 86.3%.
In 2017, both Intel and AMD will duke it out with new CPU products -- will the underdog be able to gain on Intel once again?
AMD has devised a broad strategy of tapping both the high-end and budget markets for growth. While its latest and greatest Ryzen architecture has been designed to compete in the high end segment, AMD has decided to consolidate its lower-priced offerings to meet demand from users on a budget, according to Mercury Research.
As it turns out, most PC growth until 2020 will take place in emerging markets. IDC predicts that they will account for 54.3% of PC market share in 2020, compared to 51.2% last year. Currently, the GDP per capita in most emerging markets is under $10,000, including the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China), so having budget offerings is a smart move for AMD.
According to Forbes contributor Antony Leather, AMD's baseline 4-core CPU -- the Ryzen 3 1100 -- will cost $129. By comparison, Intel's entry-level Core i3-7100 Kaby Lake processor, launched this year, is selling for just under $120 at many online retailers though its specs are not quite as strong with two fewer cores.
Competing at essentially the same price point, AMD is hoping to win over budget-minded consumers, giving it a leg up in this segment of the market.
Though Intel has already launched its Kaby Lake processors, its top-of-the-line Core i7-7700K is expected to sport weaker specs than AMD's flagship Ryzen 7 1800X processor.
In response, Intel is rumored to be launching its Kaby Lake-X Core i7-7740K processor in August this year. However, it will be late to the market with something that truly competes against the flagship Ryzen, which AMD is launching this month, giving it about six months to rack up sales before Intel can respond.
Additionally, rumors on Taiwanese site BenchLife indicate that to tap the premium market, Intel might come out with a 10-core high-end processor that could sell for as much as $1,700. Details are sparse, but such a price point generally indicates that Intel would eclipse AMD's own top-of-the-line processor (expected to retail for $499).
The gaming hardware market is expected to grow 6% annually through 2019, and the majority of that growth will take place in the high-end segment where AMD will be able to enjoy a running start. 
With these impressive releases offered at competitive prices, it won't be surprising if AMD manages to steal additional market share from Intel in 2017.

            ","Unless you closely follow the stock, you probably had no idea shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are up a gaudy 620% since March 2016 in the last 12 months. That is not a typo. 


AMD data by YCharts.
The ongoing rally in AMD shares has been perhaps one of the least discussed but most impressive investing storylines in tech in the past year. In fact, AMD's share-price surge is about three times larger than the incredible run in NVIDIA stock over the last year. So what's driving this wild, newfound bullishness in AMD stock? Let's take a look.
AMD's business has enjoyed something of a turnaround in recent quarters. After seeing sales fall for seven consecutive quarters, AMD has produced positive sales growth in each of its three most recent quarters. Investors anticipate company-specific and industrywide trends will allow AMD to expand its business presence in each of its two core operating segments in the years to come.
On the gaming side of its business,   Microsoft and Sony will each refresh their respective consoles in the coming years to enable next-generation graphic capabilities like 4K video quality and virtual reality (VR) gaming. AMD is the main supplier of semi-customer system-on-a-chip (SOC) for both Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's Playstation gaming consoles; Sony and Microsoft each consistently account for more than 10% of AMD's annual sales. 

. Microsoft has already announced its latest Xbox iteration, dubbed Project Scorpio, which will arrive in time for the 2017 holiday season. Sony has yet to announce its response to Scorpio, but major console releases tend to closely follow one another. Many industry observers believe this new upgrade cycle will create a corresponding surge in new revenue for AMD that will help extend its current sales growth momentum.
In its computing and graphics unit, AMD should enjoy an opportunity to catch up with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in CPUs and NVIDIA in GPUs to a certain extent. AMD's forthcoming 14 nm Ryzen CPUs, due to launch by March, offer more powerful performance than Intel's i7 chips. Similarly, AMD's Vega chips appear to be a legitimate challenger to NVIDIA's GeForce high-end gaming GPUs. So there's certainly a fair case to be made that sales  will indeed improve at AMD in the coming year.
All of this is to say that things are generally looking up at AMD. At the same time though, a few important points cause me to question whether its rally can continue.
Image source: Getty Images.
Though business conditions are indeed improving at AMD, it isn't as clear that this longtime ugly duckling has permanently transformed into a swan, for a few reasons.
A key piece of AMD's bull thesis is that its current 14 nm Zen server chips have closed the gap with Intel's 14 nm Broadwell server microprocessors this year, largely the result of Intel's decision to not shift its CPUs to a 10 nm die shrink, codenamed Cannonlake, until the second half of 2017. Bullish analysts see AMD catching Intel at the 14 nm level as creating a window for it to steal server market share from Intel, which indeed seems plausible. However, with Intel moving to 10 nm by the latter half of this year, AMD's parity with Intel server chips seems likely to be short-lived, making this large market-share gain difficult to sustain.
Equally important, it isn't necessarily clear whether meaningful sales growth will translate into actual profits for AMD and its investors. Though the company has gone through two separate cost-structure overhauls, in 2014 and 2015, its margin structure has continued to deteriorate. For example, its gross margins fell from 27% in 2015 to 23% in 2016, even as it saw its revenue increase 12%. This suggests AMD's business model lacks the kind of operating leverage that could allow it to quickly return to profitability if sales continue to rise.
In a nutshell, ongoing success is by no means assured at AMD. The company has done an admirable job capitalizing on its various opportunities in recent years. However, as we saw above, several structural reasons exist that may make it difficult to sustain this kind of success over the long term.

            ","Monday started the new week on a positive note, as the stock market once again recovered from early declines to post advances. The Dow Jones Industrials extended its string of record closes to 12 consecutive days in the wake of favorable comments from Warren Buffett about the valuation of the market. Moves within the Trump administration to transfer spending to the Defense Department also bolstered the overall market mood. In addition, good news from certain companies helped to sustain positive sentiment overall, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Windstream Holdings (NASDAQ:WIN), and Gogo (NASDAQ:GOGO) were among the top performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.  
Advanced Micro Devices' stock picked up 8%, reaching levels it hasn't seen in nearly a decade. Early reports of pre-order activity for AMD's new Ryzen central processing unit suggest it has been extremely strong, with some retailers having sold out of their allocations. The most powerful Ryzen 7 chip will be on sale starting this week, while slightly less powerful Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 models will get released over the course of 2017. Investors are growing increasingly confident that AMD can successfully compete against rival chipmaker Intel with Ryzen, and AMD's Polaris graphics products could also make the company more competitive against its key graphics rivals. With other chip offerings expected in 2017, investors believe that AMD CEO Lisa Su and her team of executives are making a difference and returning Advanced Micro Devices to relevance in the semiconductor industry.

Windstream Holdings' shares climbed 8% after the company announced that it had completed its merger with EarthLink. The combination should produce more than $150 million in savings every year from operating and capital expenses, because the two companies should be able to share operations and get economies of scale within the first three years after the merger. That's $25 million more in annual savings than the company originally expected, but CEO Tony Thomas said that the bigger impact will be on the two companies' customers, who ""will benefit from our expanded national fiber footprint and enhanced products and services, including [software-defined wide area networks], [unified communications as a service], network security, managed services, and cloud connectivity."" EarthLink will have three directors on Windstream's 12-person board, and the combined company anticipates plenty of benefits going forward.
Finally, shares of Gogo gained 15%. The provider of in-flight internet services reported its fourth-quarter financial results Monday morning, which included a 16% rise in revenue and a narrower net loss than in the year-earlier quarter. CEO Michael Small said that Gogo's 2Ku service offering ""demonstrates industry-leading speed, coverage, and service availability,"" and Gogo has been adding new installations quickly enough that it now expects to post positive free cash flow by 2019, a year earlier than previously expected. Even in the short term, revenue growth of 12% to 17% in 2017 and adjusted pre-tax operating earnings of $60 million to $75 million were promising. Investors hope that Gogo can keep gaining altitude despite rising competition from satellite and other providers, and for now, those hopes appear to be panning out.

In a startling turn of events, institutional broker Rosenblatt Securities announced this morning that it is recommending its clients sell Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock, and buy Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) instead.
And that's not all. Announcing a whole slew of new stock ""initiations,"" Rosenblatt urged investors this morning to buy graphics star NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), flash memory specialist Micron, and semiconductor maker Broadcom, but leave chipmaker Cavium Networks on the shelf. With so many new recommendations to choose from, we're going to limit ourselves today to just a choice handful.
Here are three things you need to know about them.
Image source: Getty Images.
After basking ""in the glory days of Moore's"" Law for years, Rosenblatt fears that the world has turned more ""data centric."" As explained in a write-up on StreetInsider.com today, Rosenblatt concedes that Intel has enjoyed a ""near 100% share"" of the market for x86 server CPUs. What the analyst worries about, though, is that the market today is tilting toward graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators, markets where Intel is less dominant.
Accordingly, when Rosenblatt initiated coverage of Intel this morning, it did so with a sell rating.
Incidentally, when you think GPUs, two names naturally spring to mind: NVIDIA and its archrival in graphics, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). It should come as no surprise, therefore, that at the same time as Rosenblatt warns against buying Intel, it's urging investors to buy AMD and NVIDIA instead.
According to the analyst, Intel's losses in x86 will be AMD's gain, as the latter enjoys the ""potential"" for ""share gain"" in ""x86 server/datacenter"" CPUs, and benefits, too, from a market that will favor makers of GPUs for ""next generation computing."" Similarly, Rosenblatt likes NVIDIA, a stock that the analyst expects to benefit from ""secular sustainability in the company's core gaming business,"" accelerated by ""[virtual reality/augmented reality] and eSports as tailwinds."" And on top of all that, Rosenblatt sees NVIDIA enjoying ""multi-billion dollar green field opportunities (AI, self-driving cars, etc.), combined with the company's unique set of scalable core IP/Software/technologies in GPGPU, deep neural network compute, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving.""
When all's said and done, Rosenblatt sees AMD stock gaining 17% as it rises to $16.50 a share over the next year, and NVIDIA surging ahead 26% in the same time frame. Needless to say, Rosenblatt recommends buying them both.
Veering away from the great Intel-AMD debate, though, Rosenblatt's most surprising call of the day is a recommendation to buy shares of Texas Instruments. Initiating with a buy rating and a 12-month price target of $90 a share, Rosenblatt is looking for 17% gain in stock price from Texas Instruments. That's about equal to the 17% expected gain from AMD stock, but less than the 26% profit Rosenblatt hopes to see from NVIDIA.
So why does Rosenblatt love TI? (And why might you?)
The answer goes beyond servers, to focus on Texas Instruments' ""dominant position in the analog industry,"" where Rosenblatt says it enjoys a ""high-teens market share"" of this $45 billion market. Furthermore, TI is making ""consistent share gains,"" enjoys a ""structural manufacturing cost advantage,"" and is producing ""sustainable FCF generation"" that makes the stock ideal for ""long term and income oriented investment.""
According to Rosenblatt, Texas Instruments is using its ""long-term structural manufacturing cost advantage [in] 300mm wafers"" to deliver ""20%- 30% FCF"" margins for shareholders. And Rosenblatt is right.
According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Texas Instruments generated positive free cash flow of $4.1 billion on $13.4 billion in revenue last year -- better than a 30% free cash flow margin, and even better than the company's net profit margin of 26.9% (on $3.6 billion in GAAP profits). What's more, ""FCF generation is all that matters at TI,"" exults Rosenblatt, and TI management aims to reward shareholders by returning literally all of its free cash (minus net debt retirement) to shareholders through a combination of payouts of its 2.6% dividend yield and stock repurchases (1.5% shares retired over the past year).
When you add those two numbers (4.1%) to analysts' projected growth rate (10%), what you get is about a 14.1% projected return to shareholders owning Texas Instruments stock -- not far short of TI's price-to-free cash flow ratio of 18.8.
Personally, I still don't think paying 18.8 times FCF for a 14% return is quite cheap enough to make TI a bargain, but apparently Rosenblatt believes it's close enough to justify a buy rating.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) recently surged after the chipmaker posted strong fourth quarter numbers, topped off with solid guidance. Revenue rose 16% annually to $1.11 billion, beating estimates by $40 million. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.01 topped expectations by a penny, and represented a major improvement from its loss of $0.10 per share in the year ago quarter. For the first quarter, AMD expects revenue to rise 18% annually -- crushing analyst estimates for 2% growth.
Image source: AMD.
Those numbers look solid, but investors looking at AMD's 460% rally over the past 12 months might be wondering if most of that good news is already priced in. Let's take a closer look at AMD's recovery, and see if it's sensible to buy AMD at its highest price in over eight years.
AMD's quarterly revenue has risen annually for three straight quarters, marking a remarkable rebound from seven straight quarters of declines. Much of that growth was fueled by the EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which produces SoCs for non-PC products like Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. 
That demand is expected to rise this year as both companies launch upgraded consoles for 4K and VR gaming. Revenue from the EESC business rose 4% annually to $506 million last quarter, but operating income fell 20% to $47 million due to higher R&D investments. In the past, the strength of the EESC business offset the relative weakness of the Computing and Graphics unit, which produces x86 CPUs and GPUs. Both product lines have traditionally struggled against Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. 
But last quarter, AMD's Computing and Graphics revenue rose 28% annually to $600 million on robust sales of its new Polaris-based RX 400 series GPUs. At the time of its launch, the $200 RX 480 was the cheapest VR-capable card on the market -- making it possible to build Rift and Vive-ready desktops for under $1,000. The unit's operating loss of $21 million was also an improvement from its loss of $99 million a year earlier.

Looking ahead, many AMD bulls believe that rising sales of PC and console-based VR headsets can simultaneously lift sales of its custom SoCs and discrete GPUs this year. They also expect AMD's next-gen CPU, Ryzen, to outperform Intel's top-tier i7 processors when they arrive in March, and that its high-end Vega GPUs will outperform NVIDIA's premium tier of Pascal-powered GeForce GPUs. If the Ryzen and Vega chips can achieve those lofty goals, AMD's Computing and Graphics unit could become the company's core growth engine again. 
AMD could also benefit from the upcoming expiration of a graphics cross-licensing deal between Intel and NVIDIA. Intel hasn't been keen on renewing that agreement, which boosts NVIDIA's revenue by $66 million per quarter, and rumors suggest that Intel could sign a comparable licensing deal with AMD instead. 
AMD also narrowed its losses, reduced its debt, and boosted its cash position in fiscal 2016. Those achievements all counter the bearish argument that AMD's losses will widen, causing it to collapse under its debt load as its cash flows dry up. Lastly, AMD stock remains fundamentally cheap after its massive rally in 2016. It trades with an EV/Sales ratio of 2.8, which is lower than Intel's ratio of 3.1 and NVIDIA's ratio of 9.4. That valuation -- along with its enterprise value of $11.6 billion -- make it a potential buyout or merger target for larger chipmakers.
Those potential catalysts all sound encouraging, but there are also reasons to avoid AMD. First, console sales could stall if consumer demand for 4K and VR games is weaker than expected. Early sales estimates for VR headsets suggest that demand for smartphone and console-based headsets is outweighing demand for PC-based ones. 
While that could boost AMD's EESC business, it could throttle demand for its VR-ready GPUs. Meanwhile, Nintendo's upcoming launch of the Switch, which is powered by an NVIDIA's Tegra X1 SoC, could also disrupt Sony and Microsoft's console sales as the original Wii did a decade ago. 
Lastly, too much of AMD's future relies on the Ryzen challenging Intel's CPUs and the Vega GPU countering NVIDIA's. While the Ryzen might beat Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors, there's no guarantee that it can topple Intel's 10nm Cannonlake processors, which will launch in late 2017. Likewise, the Vega might beat NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal GPUs, but it could be crushed by NVIDIA's next-gen Volta, which is also expected to launch this year. This means that the Ryzen and Vega could respectively become top-tier CPUs and GPUs this year, but those victories might be short lived. 
I believe that investors with a higher tolerance for risk could start partial positions in AMD at current prices. But I also believe that the chipmaker's future growth depends on it bowling a near-perfect game this year -- which could be very tough as Intel and NVIDIA launch their new competing chips.

            ","Many chipmakers posted strong numbers over the past year, thanks to rising demand for semiconductors across multiple industries. Two standout names from that sector are AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) -- which respectively rallied about 460% and 50% over the past 12 months. Let's take a closer look at both chipmakers, and see if either stock is still worth buying after those big rallies.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD is the world's second largest maker of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs. But over the past decade, Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs have greatly reduced AMD's share of both markets. To diversify away from those two markets, AMD invested heavily in Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) chips for other devices like gaming consoles. It also launched low-end ""VR ready"" GPUs to tap into the growing demand for PC-based VR games.
Cypress makes programmable semiconductors for the automotive, industrial, home automation, medical devices, and consumer electronics markets. It's been expanding aggressively over the past two years, by first merging with embedded chipmaker Spansion in a $5 billion deal in 2015, and then acquiring Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) Internet of Things (IoT) business for $550 million in 2016. Those moves made it a major player in the growing IoT market.
After falling year-over-year for seven straight quarters, AMD's revenues rose in the past three quarters, thanks to robust demand for the PS4 and Xbox One supporting its EESC business, and strong sales of its new Polaris-based GPUs bolstering the Computing and Graphics business. AMD's total revenue rose 16% annually to $1.11 billion last quarter, fueled by 4% growth in EESC revenues and 28% growth in Computing and Graphics revenues. For the current quarter, AMD expects its revenue to rise 18% annually at the midpoint -- which easily tops analysts' estimates for 2% growth.
Cypress' quarterly revenues have risen annually for nine straight quarters, but some of that growth was inflated by its aforementioned acquisitions. Cypress' revenue rose 16% annually to $530 million last quarter, thanks to the Broadcom acquisition boosting its microcontroller and connectivity division (MCD) revenues, and robust sales growth in China and Japan. For the current quarter, Cypress expects its revenues to rise 20% annually at the midpoint -- which also beats the consensus estimate of 17% growth.
AMD has enjoyed a nice lift from sales of consoles and low-end gaming GPUs over the past year, but the competition is expected to intensify this year as NVIDIA launches its next-gen Volta GPUs and Intel introduces its next-gen 10nm Cannonlake CPUs. AMD is meeting that competition head-on with its high-end Vega GPUs and Ryzen CPUs. Early data indicates that the Vega and Ryzen chips might respectively outperform NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal and Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake chips, but it's unclear how they'll fare against Volta and Cannonlake. 
Another issue with AMD is its dependence on console sales. The bulls believe that the recent PS4 and Xbox One upgrades for 4K and VR gaming can rejuvenate console sales this year, but the bears believe that those new features might not persuade consumers to buy new hardware.

Cypress is well-poised to benefit from the growing demand for connected and programmable chips in the automotive and industrial sectors. Those two high-growth markets accounted for 55% of Cypress' revenue in 2016, compared to just 30% in 2011. The Broadcom acquisition also boosted its content share per connected car by 26%, and is helping Cypress address the wired, wireless, memory, and data storage needs of the broader IoT market. But looking ahead, a key challenge for Cypress will be staying competitive against bigger rivals like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), which targets many of the same markets.
Neither AMD nor Cypress is profitable on a GAAP basis. AMD reported a GAAP loss of $497 million in fiscal 2016, but that represented an improvement from its loss of $660 million in 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, AMD's net loss narrowed from $419 million to $117 million. 
Cypress reported a GAAP loss of $686 million in fiscal 2016, which was much wider than its loss of $379 million in 2015, due to the rising costs of its inorganic growth strategy. But on a non-GAAP basis, its net income rose 142% to $170 million. Analysts currently believe that AMD can return to non-GAAP profitability this year, and expect Cypress' non-GAAP earnings to grow 41% this year.
AMD currently has an EV/Sales ratio of 2.7, which is lower than Intel's ratio of 3.1 and NVIDIA's ratio of 9.4. Cypress also has an EV/Sales ratio of 2.7, which compares favorably to Texas Instruments' ratio of 5.7. That makes both stocks fairly cheap relative to their industry peers.
I see solid reasons for buying both AMD and Cypress, but AMD's future relies too heavily on Ryzen and Vega's ability to counter Cannonlake and Volta. If those plans don't work out, AMD stock could quickly lose its footing.
Cypress has a better-diversified business, and its growth this year isn't heavily dependent on outmaneuvering bigger competitors. Cypress also pays a forward dividend yield of 3.7%, while AMD doesn't pay one at all. Therefore, the choice between the two is pretty clear -- Cypress is a much safer play than AMD at current prices.

            ","Popular stocks are expensive. An expensive stock can certainly produce market-beating returns if the underlying company performs well, but missing expectations can send the stock tumbling. Here's why Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) could devastate your portfolio.
Rich Duprey (Twitter): Shares of Twitter are up 34% over their recent lows and are 10% higher in 2017 so far, but the problems are legion with the short-form social media platform, and investors would be wise to avoid it.
Twitter user growth has largely stalled causing revenues to flag, as well. Advertisers are seemingly becoming leery about the value of the service as revenues from that avenue rose just 6% last quarter. In fact, the whole operation looks as though it's seizing up, as growth across any metric is, by and large, in the single digits -- hardly the kind of results you'd expect out of a tech company.
Image source: Getty Images.
But there are deeper problems, too, considering Twitter generates some $2.5 billion in revenues annually, which isn't all that shabby. But generating those revenues is apparently a very expensive business -- some $1.2 billion, or almost half its sales. And last quarter, the company announced that it needed to restructure its operations, which meant firing 9% of its workforce.
Of course, there are also the usual complaints about the online bullying that occurs on the social media platform, in addition to the rabid flash-mob attacks that can instantly appear if you fall on the wrong side of the issue. And Twitter is having a growing credibility problem as more and more of its accounts are found to be operated by bots.
According to recent research, there could be a network of almost 1 million bots controlling accounts on the site. While Twitter actively tries to monitor and prevent such accounts from existing, it points to some underlying problems that may create unease with its value.
Earnings are due out very soon, so we'll get to see in which direction Twitter is headed, but there's no reason to think it's about to reverse course now, and will likely only reveal a further deceleration in its growth path.
Tim Green (Advanced Micro Devices): Shares of AMD quadrupled in 2016 as investors bought into the story that new products would return the company to its former glory. Ryzen, AMD's highly anticipated PC CPU, will be arriving in early March. Vega, a high-end GPU gunning for NVIDIA, is expected to be available sometime during the second quarter.
The rally in AMD shares has so far been based mainly on hope. The company is still losing money, and its revenue is far below peak levels. Both Ryzen and Vega have a lot of potential, and AMD's deal with Google to put its server GPUs in the cloud is a good first step in catching up with NVIDIA in that area. But now, AMD needs to deliver.
AMD's market capitalization has reached about $12.3 billion, up from less than $2 billion at the beginning of 2016. In AMD's best year in the past decade, 2011, it earned $491 million of net income. AMD stock trades for 25 times that peak number, despite the company losing money in each of the past five years.
Ryzen and Vega, both high-end products, can certainly drive AMD's margins higher. But the market is pricing in something close to the best-case scenario. Absolutely everything must go right for AMD. Anything short of that could spell disaster.
Beth McKenna (Mattel): A popular stock -- especially among income investors -- that could prove toxic to investors' portfolios is toymaker Mattel, best known for making the iconic fashion doll, Barbie. Some of its other well-known brands are Fisher-Price, Match Box, Hot Wheels, and American Girl. 
Mattel stock's long-term trajectory was solidly up through 2013. Declining Barbie sales then resulted in the stock dropping through late 2015. The company's turnaround efforts started showing signs of success beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. Coupled with Mattel's generous dividend, these signs caused many investors to dive in, pushing the stock up considerably from its trough in 2015 into 2016.
The dividend recently got juicier -- but not for a good reason -- and is now yielding 5.9%. This increase was due to the stock's nearly 18% plunge in late January after Mattel reported weak fourth-quarter 2016 earnings.

Prime rival Hasbro has been significantly outperforming Mattel on both the business and stock-performance fronts. Data by YCharts.
The fourth quarter is critical for toy retailers because it includes the holiday period. Mattel's net sales declined 8% as reported, and 6% in constant currency, while adjusted earnings per share dropped 20%. Excluding sales from Disney Princess and Frozen -- Mattel lost this lucrative doll license to Hasbro in 2016 -- gross sales were flat as reported, and up in the mid-single digits in constant currency. So Mattel has done a nice job in closing the revenue gap created by the lost Disney license.
However, two metrics were quite concerning and point to continued struggles ahead. First, Barbie sales declined 2%, as reported, and were up 1% in constant currency. Increasing Barbie sales is the cornerstone of Mattel's turnaround plan -- and these metrics suggest the turnaround has stalled. Second, the company's decent showing on the revenue front came at a price: Gross margin decreased 320 basis points, driven mainly by increased discounting, as well as currency headwinds.
As to that fat dividend, it's not infinitely sustainable. Mattel's trailing-12-month cash dividend payout ratio (dividends paid/free cash flow) has exceeded 100% throughout 2016. This means it's paying out more in dividends than it's generating in free cash flow.
One caveat to my opinion that Mattel stock could prove toxic -- the stock could get a lift if market chatter about a merger between Mattel and Hasbro comes to fruition. But investors shouldn't buy the stock of a company based solely on merger and acquisition rumors.

            ","After years of slumping market share and lackluster performance, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will re-enter the high-end CPU and GPU markets this year with Ryzen and Vega. Ryzen, the company's new CPU, aims to go toe-to-toe with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), while Vega, its new GPU, looks to chip away at NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance.
AMD reported its fourth-quarter results in January, concluding its fifth consecutive year of losses. The situation could improve dramatically this year if Ryzen and Vega drive market share gains, something the market is already pricing in. During AMD's quarterly conference call, CEO Lisa Su provided some additional details on the company's results and outlook. Here are four quotes from Su, taken from the transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.
Image source: AMD.
AMD launched its Polaris line of mainstream graphics cards in mid-2016. The RX 480 came first, priced at $239 to $199 depending on the amount of memory, followed by the lower-end RX 470 and RX 460. Revenue in AMD's computing and graphics segment jumped 28% year over year during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by Polaris.
In graphics, strong sales increases across all of our product lines drove a double-digit increase in GPU processor revenue from a year ago. Desktop GPU shipments and revenue increased by double-digit percentages from a year ago based on growing OEM and channel adoption of Polaris GPU's. Polaris processor sales were particularly strong in the performance and enthusiast portions of the market, resulting in our highest channel GPU sales in more than two years.
The company's unit market share was near its bottom, around 20%, during the fourth quarter of 2015, so it's an easy comparison. Among gamers, Polaris has been nowhere near as successful as NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards. Steam's hardware and software survey puts NVIDIA's GTX 1060 at more than four times the popularity of the RX 480. So while Polaris is driving growth and gaining some momentum, it's far from a runaway success.
Software is one area where NVIDIA has built up an advantage over the past few years. On the gaming side, NVIDIA's GeForce experience gives gamers a slew of features like per-game optimization and built in live-streaming. GameWorks, NVIDIA's library of software for game developers, allows developers to implement advanced visual features optimized specifically for NVIDIA hardware.
On the compute side, the list of software ported to run on NVIDIA's GPUs is long, ranging from computational finance to molecular dynamics simulations. This advantage will be tough to overcome, but AMD is pushing on that front.
We continue to invest in software, and our approach to software is really around open source and using the ecosystem and using the community and focused on the new APIs. So in gaming, we are very focused on DX12 and Vulcan. And on the professional graphics and on the GPU server side, really using our GPUOpen. So we will continue to invest in software; no question that that is really critical for the graphics market. But we feel we are making good progress.
Ryzen is set to become available in early March for PCs, but new server processors will be coming a bit later. Naples is AMD's new server CPU based on the Zen architecture, expected to launch during the second quarter. The strategy will be to go after the broader server CPU market, not just cloud computing.
The great thing about Naples is it really is a general-purpose product, so we will play in all of those segments. I think the cloud tends to move a bit faster in terms of just, again, from design win to revenue. So we certainly are very focused in the cloud, but I'm also quite enthusiastic about our opportunities in traditional enterprise as well as some of the storage and networking spaces.
Intel currently has a near-monopoly in the server CPU market, so AMD will be facing an uphill battle to say the least. But the server CPU market is essentially all upside for the company, since it has little presence today. If AMD can claw back a little market share from Intel, it would help drive the company back to profitability.
AMD no longer manufactures its own chips, but Su is confident that the company's roadmap will be competitive.
From our standpoint, process technology, we ramped 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer really well last year and into this year. We are actually in the process of developing now in 7-nanometer and we think the 7-nanometer foundry roadmaps are available, are very competitive, and will ensure that we have a strong multigenerational roadmap.
Intel has had plenty of trouble lately, abandoning its tick-tock strategy by inserting a third 14-nanometer chip into its roadmap. Intel's 10-nanometer chips are expected to come later this year, but the manufacturing gap between Intel and AMD will narrow substantially upon the launch of Ryzen. That's certainly good news for AMD.

            ","Wall Street didn't have a celebration on Monday, with major market benchmarks easing lower on what turned out to be a fairly quiet day in the stock market. Ongoing nervousness about tension related to new U.S. government policies weighed on some investors' minds, and a drop in the oil market also contributed to declines of 19 points for the Dow Jones Industrials and roughly five points for the S&P 500. Yet some stocks enjoyed better news, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), and First Majestic Silver (NYSE:AG) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Advanced Micro Devices climbed 11% after getting a favorable write-up in the weekly issue of Barron's over the weekend. The publication said that the chipmaker is fighting back against its main rivals in the microprocessor and graphics processing unit markets, and it therefore thinks that the company's stock could double from current levels despite already having produced impressive returns for shareholders over the past year. AMD has disappointed investors before with turnaround stories, but CEO Lisa Su is arguably in a better position to chart a successful course than some of her predecessors at the long-beleaguered semiconductor company. Given how low it went, even incremental progress could keep lifting AMD stock throughout 2017.
Image source: AMD.
Cabot Oil & Gas climbed in the wake of its getting good news from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FERC approved Williams Companies' Atlantic Sunrise pipeline, which Cabot intends to use heavily in order to transport energy production from its holdings in the Marcellus shale region. Stock analysts also cited the FERC decision in upgrading the stock, but the more important issue is that the prospect for greater infrastructure for transporting oil and natural gas from the Marcellus and other underserved regions of the country could in the long run boost the prospects of not only Cabot but also similarly placed small oil and gas exploration and production companies. Moreover, if energy prices keep climbing, then demand for newly transportable energy could stay strong indefinitely.
Finally, First Majestic Silver gained 7%. Precious metals had a generally solid day, with gold rising $15 per ounce to $1,235, and silver gaining more than 1% as well. Silver prices are already up more than 10% so far in 2017, and First Majestic in particular made aggressive moves in order to accelerate future growth to take advantage of a rebound in silver over the course of the past year. By spending capital on improvements and rehabilitation projects, First Majestic hopes to grow its production from around 11 million to 12 million silver ounces currently to as much as 20 million ounces in the next three to five years. That's a tall order, but First Majestic's assets are attractive, and continued strength in the silver market would make the job even easier for the miner going forward.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped on Monday in an apparent reaction to a bullish article that appeared on Barron's over the weekend. At 2:30 p.m. EST, the stock was up about 10.5%.
The Barron's article argues that shares of AMD, which quadrupled last year, could double this year as the company launches new GPUs and CPUs that aim to challenge both NVIDIA and Intel. Ryzen, AMD's upcoming CPU, is set for an early March launch, while Vega, its high-end GPU, will be out sometime during the second quarter.
The article argues that AMD is now a more focused and streamlined company under CEO Lisa Su, one that won't repeat past mistakes. AMD was a major force in the PC CPU market in 2006, but its market share has collapsed since then following a series of missteps. Intel has been able to run away with the high end of the market as a result.
Image source: AMD.
On the GPU side, NVIDIA has spent the past few years consolidating its lead. AMD has shown some progress with Polaris, its mainstream line of graphics cards launched last year, but the real test will be the high-end Vega. But its competitor owns the high end, and it won't take kindly to AMD's attempted intrusions.
NVIDIA has found great success selling its GPUs into enterprise markets as accelerator cards, and the article argues that this presents an opportunity for AMD as well. Late last year, Alphabet's Google announced that it was installing AMD's GPUs into its cloud platform along with its competitor's, a big cloud win that AMD now needs to repeat with the other major cloud computing vendors.
The article ends in an optimistic tone: ""Supplying a brand-new market like cloud computing, where the rules are still being written, gives AMD an opportunity that lies well beyond being a second banana to Intel and Nvidia. It could even make AMD a much more strategic company with an importance all its own.""
AMD still posted a loss in 2016, and its revenue is well below peak levels. Ryzen and Vega will need to do well in order to justify the current stock price, let alone another 100% increase. In the absolute best-case scenario, where both Ryzen and Vega are smash hits and AMD makes up some serious ground in the data center, a doubling of the stock price could make sense. But that seems like a long shot to me, especially given AMD's long history of disappointing investors.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) ended 2016 on a high note. The company beat analyst estimates across the board when it reported its fourth-quarter results, driven mostly by its Polaris graphics cards. The PC CPU market also treated AMD a little better, with client processor sales improving compared to the third quarter.
AMD enters 2017 on the cusp of launching what CEO Lisa Su calls ""our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade."" Ryzen, the company's new CPU, is now confirmed to be launching in early March, while Vega, its upcoming high-end GPU, is set to launch sometime during the second quarter.
AMD is also in a far better financial position thanks to a joint venture deal and the sale of stock and convertible notes last year. The company had $1.26 billion in cash and $1.44 billion of debt at the end of 2016, compared to $785 million in cash and $2.24 billion in debt at the end of 2015. The diluted share count has jumped 17.7%, but that's a small price to pay for a sound balance sheet.
Despite beating estimates, AMD still posted a loss during the fourth quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Revenue jumped 15% year over year, but seasonally low sales of semi-custom products knocked sales down 15% compared to the third quarter. AMD managed a non-GAAP operating profit, but non-GAAP EPS still came in at a loss of $0.01. GAAP EPS was a larger loss of $0.06.
The computing and graphics segment, which includes GPUs and CPUs, produced $600 million of revenue, up 27.7% year over year and up 27.1% sequentially. AMD's Polaris graphics cards seem to be gaining some momentum, as they drove far less impressive growth during the third quarter. The segment posted an operating loss of $21 million, a major improvement over the $99 million loss reported during the fourth quarter of 2015.
The semi-custom segment grew revenue by 3.7% year over year to $506 million. Revenue sank 39% year over year, but this was expected. The third quarter features the buildup of game console inventory for the holiday season, and with the segment still dominated by game console SoCs, there's no way to avoid this seasonality. Segment operating income was $47 million, down 20% year over year despite the higher revenue.
AMD expects its first-quarter revenue to grow by 18% year over year, representing an 11% sequential decline. The company didn't provide earnings guidance for the quarter, but it did provide a more general outlook for 2017. AMD expects revenue to grow this year, with non-GAAP gross margin improving and non-GAAP net income turning positive. With both Ryzen and Vega launching soon, these goals aren't particularly optimistic.
Whether AMD's bottom line surges enough to justify the buoyant stock price is another matter. AMD's stock soared in 2016, and the company now has a market capitalization of around $10 billion. AMD will likely need to get its operating margin into the double-digits for that price to make much sense, a tall order for a company that has lost money in each of the past five years.
There's still plenty we don't know about Ryzen and Vega. Su talked about Ryzen during the conference call, but there wasn't much new information. The initial launch will be focused on the high end, competing with Intel's i7 and i5 chips, with the lineup eventually filled out with lower-end products. The breadth of the initial launch is still an unknown, as is pricing. Even less is known about Vega.
2017 looks like it will be the year that AMD returns to profitability, at least on a non-GAAP basis. The size of those profits depends on whether Ryzen and Vega live up to expectations. With Ryzen set to launch in a month or so, more details should be coming soon.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soared on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter results that bested analyst expectations. AMD's guidance called for continued revenue growth during the first quarter, and the company confirmed that its highly anticipated Ryzen CPU will be launching in early March. At 11:15 a.m. EST, the stock was up about 12%.
AMD reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.11 billion, up 15% year over year and about $40 million higher than the average analyst estimate. Revenue dropped 15% compared to the third quarter due to seasonality in the semi-custom business, which is dominated by game console SoCs.
The computing and graphics segment grew revenue by 28% year over year, to $600 million, driven by higher GPU sales. AMD launched its Polaris line of mainstream graphics cards in mid-2016. Ryzen and Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end GPU scheduled for the second quarter, should continue to drive growth in this segment in 2017.
The semi-custom segment grew revenue to $506 million, up 4% year over year. Sales slumped 39% compared to the third quarter, which is the peak period for the business each year. A $47 million segment operating profit offset a $21 million operating loss in the computing and graphics segment.
Non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) came in at a loss of $0.01, an improvement compared to a loss of $0.10 during the prior-year period and $0.01 better than analysts were expecting.
AMD expects its revenue to grow and its non-GAAP EPS to turn positive in 2017. Revenue is expected to grow by 18% year over year during the first quarter, driven by Polaris, as well as a contribution from Ryzen.
Details are still thin on both Ryzen and Vega, but more information should be revealed as we get closer to launch. If priced aggressively, both products could make a big impact on their respective markets, helping AMD win market share from Intel and NVIDIA. If AMD can avoid its habit of over promising and under delivering, 2017 could be a very good year for the company.

Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) fourth-quarter report, set to be released after the market closes on Tuesday, will be the last quarterly report prior to the launch of its highly anticipated new products. Ryzen, its upcoming high-end CPU, will launch sometime during the first quarter, and Vega, its new high-end GPU, is set for some time during the first half.
AMD is expected to grow revenue during the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period, but a steep decline compared to the third quarter is also expected. The semi-custom business, still comprised primarily of game console SoCs, peaks in the third quarter as inventory is ramped up for the holidays. AMD's mainstream Polaris graphics cards should drive some growth in the computing and graphics segment, but the company is still expected to post a non-GAAP net loss.
AMD guided for an 18% sequential decline in revenue for the fourth quarter in its third-quarter earnings report, implying revenue of roughly $1.07 billion. That's up 12% year over year, a deceleration from the 23% growth posted in the third quarter. Analysts' average estimate is in line with this guidance, with very little variation in estimates suggesting a high level of confidence.
AMD didn't provide earnings guidance, but the non-GAAP profit the company managed during the third quarter likely won't be repeated. Analysts expect a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.02 on average, an improvement from a loss of $0.10 during the fourth quarter of 2015 but a loss nonetheless.
Analysts aren't expecting much from AMD during 2017, despite two high-profile product launches. The average estimate calls for just 8.1% revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS of just $0.05 for the full year, although the ranges are wide. AMD's guidance for the first quarter should include some impact from the launch of Ryzen, so that should give investors some insight into AMD's confidence in the product. If Ryzen and Vega lead to meaningful market share gains, AMD could very well blow these estimates for 2017 out of the water.
With Ryzen potentially just a few weeks away, AMD should be announcing more information on its new line of CPUs soon. What we know so far, based on AMD's demonstrations, is that the eight-core variant of the chip is competitive with Intel products in terms of performance. AMD expects the chips to deliver greater than a 40% increase in instructions per clock, a measure of single-threaded performance, exceeding its long-held target.
We don't know much else about Ryzen. Only the eight-core version has been shown off so far, and pricing is still a mystery. Given AMD's weak position in the CPU industry, I would expect aggressive pricing from the company. Intel certainly has room to lower prices if necessary, so it will be interesting to see how disruptive Ryzen ends up. Investors should listen for any new Ryzen information during the company's earnings conference call.
The semi-custom business is still heavily dependent on the major game consoles. AMD has so far announced three semi-custom deals in addition to its original game console deals, but two of those were new versions of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The third is outside of game consoles, but AMD hasn't disclosed exactly what it is. The company had no new deals to announce after the third quarter, but CEO Lisa Su pointed to very active discussions with potential customers. Investors should expect an update on what has become an extremely important part of AMD's business.
With Ryzen and Vega still in the future, AMD's fourth-quarter report is unlikely to surprise. The company's Polaris graphics cards should drive some revenue growth in the computing and graphics segment, but a return to profitability depends on the success of its upcoming products.

            ","While the PC market as a whole has been slumping for years, the PC gaming market has only gotten stronger. Jon Peddie Research recently came out with a report pegging the size of the global PC gaming hardware market at $30 billion. This includes not only pre-built gaming PCs but also components like graphics cards and accessories like headsets and input devices.
There has been no greater beneficiary of a growing PC gaming market than graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). As rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) snagged contracts to supply chips for the major game consoles, NVIDIA's lead in the PC GPU market grew, driven by disruptive products like the GTX 900 series in late 2014. A combination of a growing PC gaming installed base and market share gains has propelled NVIDIA's gaming segment to new heights.
Image source: NVIDIA.
The growth that NVIDIA has been reporting in recent quarters has been stunning. The gaming segment, by far its largest segment, was largely responsible for driving the company's revenue higher in 2016. During the first three quarters, NVIDIA reported year-over-year gaming revenue growth of 17%, 18%, and 63%, respectively.
The major acceleration during the third quarter sent the stock soaring, and NVIDIA's fourth-quarter guidance suggests that another big increase is in the cards. The launch of NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, which have proven to be extremely popular, in mid-2016 was responsible for much of this growth. NVIDIA will also be supplying chips for Nintendo's upcoming Switch console, and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang attributed ""a fair amount"" of its gaming growth to that contract.
Revenue from Nintendo will be seasonal, likely dropping off after launch and peaking each year prior to the holiday season. That's one reason why NVIDIA's gaming segment is unlikely to keep growing consistently at a 60%-plus rate. But there's another, more basic, reason that keeping up this growth will be tough: The PC gaming hardware market just isn't growing all that fast.
Jon Peddie Research estimates that the global PC gaming hardware market will grow at a 6% compound annual rate through 2019. That's nothing to sneeze at, but NVIDIA's gaming segment is ultimately constrained by the size of the market.
There are a few ways that NVIDIA can grow faster than the market as a whole. First, that $30 billion total includes plenty of products that aren't graphics cards. Graphics card sales could certainly grow faster than the market as a whole, driving up NVIDIA's revenue at a higher rate.
Second, the graphics card market could continue to shift toward the high-end, leading revenue to grow faster than units. The high-end of the gaming hardware market is its largest segment, representing 43% of revenue. NVIDIA has been largely focused on the high-end for the past few years, driving a portion of the company's ongoing margin expansion.
There's also one thing that can hurt growth. AMD will be launching its high-end Vega GPU during the first half of 2017. This will mark the company's re-entry into the high-end portion of the market, following the failure of its Fury line of graphics cards to make a dent in 2015. It would be difficult for AMD's competitive position to get any worse, so if Vega is competitive with NVIDIA's high-end products, the growth of NVIDIA's gaming segment could suffer.
The PC gaming market is a good place to be, and NVIDIA's focus on the high end has paid dividends. The company's gaming segment can certainly continue to grow at a healthy rate, with a double-digit pace certainly possible. But expecting the 63% growth rate of the third quarter to become the new norm isn't realistic.

            ","NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) both operate in the semiconductor industry. That's about as far as their similarity goes. One is a rising star in embedded solutions and automotive computing, heading into a $47 billion merger with sector giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The other is an eternal underdog in the PC market that's working on a dramatic turnaround right now.
Which chip stock is a better fit for your portfolio? Let's find out.
The choice between AMD and NXP boils down to two simple questions:
I have often said that the Qualcomm-NXP combination looks like a lock. The two companies share very few customers and end markets, so this merger is not likely to create any sort of monopoly. Regulatory roadblocks would have to focus on the sheer scale of the buyout. Moreover, President Donald Trump is paving the way to easier megamergers by nominating anti-regulation candidates to many key government roles. So, this buyout should be a cakewalk.
Unfortunately, that high-odds risk has suddenly become more likely.
Last week, Qualcomm was served a lawsuit from major customer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), wherein the iPhone maker claims that the chipmaker has been playing extortion games with its component supply chain.
Qualcomm shares fell as much as 14% on the news, and some analysts expect the lawsuit to delay the NXP deal. Renewed scrutiny of Qualcomm's business practices could block rubber-stamp deal approvals in important territories such as China, Taiwan, and South Korea.
The Apple charge will also divert management attention and other assets from the NXP process. If nothing else, the final approval might be pushed into 2018 or beyond.
This is a real risk for the NXP merger, but I still expect the final signatures to be delivered by the end of the year. This business combination is too important to let it slide out of view. And don't forget that regulatory intervention would lead to Qualcomm sending a $1.25 billion breakup fee NXP's way.
Your mileage may vary, which is fine. But if you agree with my analysis, NXP remains a near-certain 14% return from here, and AMD needs to show a stronger hand than that.

Image source: Getty Images.
Let's cut to the chase: AMD shares could go absolutely anywhere in 2017. That's enough to keep my finger away from the buy button.
The chipmaker had a fantastic year in 2016. AMD introduced a new graphics chip architecture to rave reviews, promised an equally game-changing update to its CPU portfolio in 2017, and saw share prices quadruple. AMD's chart has cooled down a bit in January, falling back 12% as the company prepares for a fourth-quarter report next week. But that's still a lot of market momentum. Share prices could keep skyrocketing in 2017 if the company continues to deliver on its next-generation technology promises.
That's a big if, though. AMD does not have a great track record when it comes to dependable execution, and often falls far short of ambitious goals. Recently appointed CEO Lisa Su has been a breath of fresh air so far, but she is battling the fallout from nearly a decade's worth of less-successful predecessors.
If AMD's momentum runs out, the stock has a long way to fall. AMD's trailing earnings and EBITDA profits are negative, and free cash flows stand at a razor-thin $148 million. Lacking the support of traditional valuation builders, the stock chart would take a dramatic nosedive in a hurry on the slightest of errors.
AMD owners can win big or lose big here. That's a poker chip, not an investment thesis.
By contrast, NXP offers a near-guaranteed 14% return. Even if the Qualcomm deal falls apart, there's a quick $1.25 billion cash payment in it for NXP investors.
This one isn't a close call. I would take NXP over AMD in a heartbeat.

The tech sector was the market's top performer in 2016, and its deep and far-reaching impact on business and everyday life suggests it will continue to be a go-to for investors seeking tremendous growth opportunities. Technology is fast-moving and tends to be highly competitive, so companies that operate in tech -- including Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), Qualcomm, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- are constantly facing new pressures that influence future outcomes. While investing in the broader space has been historically rewarding over the past two decades, staying on top of the dynamics that are shaping the industry is essential for new and seasoned investors alike.
To provide readers with a primer on some of the most important elements shaping the financial performance of tech companies, we asked three of The Motley Fool's top writers to each spotlight one of the most important things to know about the technology sector.
Brian Feroldi: One of the most challenging aspects of investing in the tech sector is that competition tends to be fierce. That fact makes it quite difficult for companies to maintain their profit margins over the long term, which can lead to disastrous results for investors. 
A nice case study of this principle in action can be seen by comparing the long-term results of two semiconductor manufacturers -- Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Skyworks Solutions. Over the past decade, AMD has struggled to convince customers that its chips are deserving of a premium price tag, which has led to a significant decline in the company's gross profit margin. Over the same time period, Skyworks' focus on manufacturing specialty chips that are used in mobile devices has allowed it to increase its gross profit margin.

AMD's inability to maintain its profit margin has caused its stock to languish. Skyworks, on the other hand, has turned out to be a home-run investment. 

AMD data by YCharts
The takeaway here is clear -- before you buy a tech stock, or any stock for that matter, ask yourself if the company will be able to maintain its pricing power over the long term. If the answer is no, your money is probably best invested elsewhere.
Keith Noonan: The tech industry is going through a major period of consolidation, as companies operating in the sector aim to create defensive benefits, quickly ramp up competencies in emerging categories such as the Internet of Things, and build encompassing platforms that keep customers engaged in their ecosystems. 2016 saw a huge acquisitions push across hardware, software, and services. Qualcomm's $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors was the biggest deal of the year and rapidly accelerated the company's position in connected cars. Intel also went on a purchasing spree to strengthen its competitiveness in automobile chips and services. Companies with strengths in the Internet of Things will continue to be acquisition targets going forward, and 2017 looks to be another big year for purchases related to connectivity and data analytics technologies.
Many of tech's big players are also buying up assets outside of the sector -- and entertainment companies are emerging as common acquisitions targets. With Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet dominating the advertising business and making moves toward disrupting the traditional internet service provider and wireless carrier models, some companies threatened by the commoditization of their services are responding by bolstering their positions in content. Comcast continued its push to grow its studio entertainment business by buying DreamWorks Animation in 2016, and AT&T has made an $85.4 billion bid to acquire Time Warner -- a move that comes on the heels of its $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV. The AT&T and Time Warner merger faces regulatory obstacles to closing, but the power held by Facebook and Google and the broader climate of consolidation bolster the case for approval.
Buying a company in the hopes that it will be acquired is a risky investment strategy, but there's incredible momentum in acquisitions, and it seems all-but-certain that the tech industry will continue to be shaped by the ongoing consolidation push.
Brian Stoffel: There is, perhaps, no skill set more in demand than those who know how to code, create, and design technology, especially when it comes to designing user-friendly interfaces. There's a huge chasm between the techno-nerds who know how to make stuff, and the rest of us mere mortals. Having a team of individuals who take a very complex system, and make it very simple and easy to use, is what separates the winners from the losers in the technology field.
That's why attracting -- and retaining -- top talent is so important in the technology sector. It helps explain why companies such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) can pull in $415 million in free cash flow over the past year and still post a loss of $380 million . Much of that difference is in the form of enormous equity bonus packages paid to employees.
One way I like to note how well a company is doing at keeping its talent is by going through Glassdoor.com reviews. Companies such as Facebook do extremely well, with an average rating of 4.5 stars out of 5.0. And organizations that ""get"" what motivates a workforce can make a huge difference as well.
Consider an excerpt from a 2010 filing by Alphabet subsidiary Google. In it, management said: 
[Monetary] incentives are secondary to career growth, work environment, and engaging work opportunities. We seek to develop a highly motivated and collaborative workforce that pursues achievements for the sake of progress and innovation. 
It's that type of thinking that can turn technology companies into decades-long wealth builders, and it's what investors should be looking for.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 295% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. A return to revenue growth, a series of deals that bolstered the balance sheet, the launch of its mainstream Polaris graphics cards, and optimism regarding new CPUs and GPUs set to launch in the coming months drove the stock higher.
AMD entered 2016 in rough shape. Revenue in 2015 slumped 28%, leading to a net loss of more than $400 million. Cash was dwindling, approaching the lower limit of the company's target range. On top of all that, AMD's core CPU and GPU products were largely not competitive with those of Intel or NVIDIA.
AMD took a few steps in 2016 to raise cash, giving it some much-needed breathing room that boosted investor confidence in a turnaround. A deal to create a joint venture in China around the company's x86 server technology raised $293 million in licensing fees, with the potential for royalties on sales of chips. More cash was raised later in the year when AMD sold new common stock and convertible notes, further bolstering the balance sheet.

Data by YCharts.
AMD returned to year-over-year revenue growth during the second quarter and posted even stronger growth during the third quarter. The launch of the Polaris mainstream graphics cards lifted the computing and graphics segment, while strong demand for semi-custom game console chips drove growth in the semi-custom segment. Polaris hasn't been as big of a success as NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, at least according to Steam's hardware and software survey numbers, but it did help return the company to growth.
AMD revealed some information about Ryzen, its upcoming CPU, and Vega, its upcoming high-end GPU, last year, adding fuel to the fire. The market is betting that AMD will become competitive in both the high-end CPU and GPU markets when those products launch during the first half of 2017.
There's no question that AMD is in a stronger position than it was at the end of 2015. The top line and balance sheet are looking stronger, and Ryzen and Vega have the potential to return the company to profitability.
But investors should not forget AMD's long history of over-promising and under-delivering. The Bulldozer family of CPUs launched in 2011 turned out to be a complete disaster for the company. The Fury line of high-end GPUs launched in 2015 didn't even move the needle despite AMD hyping up its use of high-bandwidth memory. And Polaris, while producing some growth for the company, has been completely overshadowed by NVIDIA's Pascal.
2017 may be different. Based on what AMD has said so far, both Ryzen and Vega have some serious potential. But if either product comes up short of expectations, the stock's impressive gains from last year could quickly vanish.

Investors love stocks that give them massive returns. The most common way to get huge gains is to invest for the long run, counting on fundamental business success to produce ample dividends and lucrative share-price appreciation. Yet sometimes, gains come in a very quick period of time, and a very small number of stocks have managed to quadruple in value in just the past year. Below, we'll look at Ariad Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ARIA), U.S. Steel (NYSE:X), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to see whether investors who are seeing the companies for the very first time will be able to squeeze out any more gains from their stocks.

ARIA data by YCharts.
Ariad Pharmaceuticals has seen the bulk of its share gains come very recently. Throughout 2016, excitement built up for Ariad's Iclusig treatment for two rare forms of leukemia. Yet although the treatment had good results for the blood and bone marrow diseases, the high price tag that Ariad charged for the drug made some investors nervous that more stringent federal regulation of drug prices could result in lower long-term profits for the company. Those fears largely abated after the presidential election, as investors see President-elect Donald Trump as being less likely to encourage regulation and allowing Ariad to earn its profits longer.
Then, just earlier this week, Ariad announced that Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda Pharmaceutical would buy out Ariad in an all-cash deal worth $5.2 billion. The $24-per-share price for the takeover sent Ariad up 73% in a single day, bringing its gains to nearly 350% since this time last year. Going forward, investors can't expect any further share-price gains from Ariad given the buyout bid, and although few expect roadblocks to the deal, there's at least some chance that a rejection of the merger could send Ariad shares back downward.
U.S. Steel's big gains have come from steady upward movement throughout the past year. Even before the presidential election, prospects for healthier economic conditions across the globe had investors getting more excited about the steel industry. Moreover, favorable rulings from the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed anti-dumping tariffs on foreign competitors, creating greater opportunities for U.S. Steel to compete more effectively against foreign competition.
The presidential election also led to a big bounce for U.S. Steel. Plans to boost infrastructure spending were bullish for the construction industry, and steel will likely play a substantial role in any infrastructure rebuilding or new construction that takes place. Exactly how far that can pull U.S. Steel's profits higher remains to be seen, but investors are excited enough to have given the stock a more than 375% return over the past 12 months in anticipation of better times ahead. Shareholders shouldn't expect another quadruple in the near future, but the stock hasn't necessarily hit its top just yet.
Finally, Advanced Micro Devices has been the winner of this group, with its stock climbing more than 435% since this time last year. Several victories have helped propel the semiconductor company higher, including a couple of deals to create joint ventures with partners in Asia. The sale of its semiconductor assembly and test assets to Nanton Fujitsu Microelectronics gave AMD about $320 million in cash to launch strategic efforts of its own, and another deal with Tianjin Haiguang earned AMD almost $300 million more for licensing its x86 server chips for the Chinese server market.
The biggest win for Advanced Micro Devices came from its Polaris graphics cards, which have helped it become an even bigger player in the graphics processing unit market. Major customers have replied by using AMD chips in their own products, eating into the commanding lead that NVIDIA has had for years. Even if Advanced Micro Devices maintains only modest market shares in key markets, the opportunities there are big enough for the stock to keep climbing sharply in 2017 and beyond.
Investors can't count on any stock they own quadrupling in such a short period of time. Although Ariad's upside is almost nonexistent, both AMD and U.S. Steel could continue to see gains if things keep going well in their respective markets.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 27.3% in the month of December, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, continuing its stellar climb on encouraging rumors and as analysts continued to express optimism for shares of the graphics chip specialist.
For perspective, AMD stock climbed more than 300% when all was said and done in 2016, including a 23% rise in November after the company announced its Radeon GPU technology will be available to Google Cloud Platform users starting in 2017.
But shares began their December rise early in the month after rumors surfaced that AMD has struck a deal with Intel to license its Radeon graphics technology. If this rumor proves true, Intel is apparently planning to integrate that technology into its future processors.
Two days later, analysts at Merrill Lynch upgraded AMD stock to ""buy"" from ""underperform,"" effectively reversing a negative call made more than two years ago and admitting they missed out on AMD's stunning turnaround. Analysts at Mizuho Securities followed suit two weeks later, citing significant opportunities for gross margin expansion given incremental revenue from deep learning application wins for AMD's ProGFx, Ryzen, and Zen chips.
I'm a firm proponent of the idea that winners keep on winning, so it's no surprise to see Wall Street analysts offering their respective votes of confidence as AMD executes its ongoing business turnaround. If AMD can indeed improve its gross margin in the coming year while identifying additional compelling growth industries to put its flagship GPU technology to work, it will be equally unsurprising to see AMD stock keep delivering market-beating returns going forward.

Some great investment returns just sneak up on you. That stock you're watching seems primed for nothing special, or maybe a downright disaster. Then the chart squiggles suddenly skyrocket, rewarding shareholders with massive returns.
And you missed it.
Here at the end of 2016, that's how I feel about longtime graphics-chip rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Their stock charts took a drastic positive turn this year, leaving me flat-footed alongside many other investors.
And you know what? I kind of wish I had added to my Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stake in early February, or perhaps the middle of the summer. But I didn't. So here I am, telling you all about those missed opportunities instead.
Let's be honest -- nobody, but nobody, had any real reason to believe that NVIDIA or AMD would soar sky-high in 2016.
Both companies were polishing up brand-new architectures for their graphics chips, and AMD was also preparing to launch a new platform for PC and server processors. That might sound promising at first glance, but both companies have a history of fumbling important technology launches.
NVIDIA and AMD shares were already on a roll, as investors were hoping for the best out of those important chip announcements. As New Year's rolled around, the stocks had gained more than 60% in just five months. That could very well have been the end of this story, setting investors up for huge corrections if anything went wrong.
But both AMD and NVIDIA reached into their top hats to produce some good-looking bunny rabbits. They proceeded to unveil the new NVIDIA Pascal and AMD Polaris chips, selling truckloads of these products in the second half of the year. AMD delivered three earnings surprises in 2016 along with strong top-line results, and NVIDIA blew every target out of the water.
I did not see any of this coming, and can only glare ruefully at their year-to-date returns. NVIDIA shares have more than tripled, showing a 235% return this year, while AMD quadrupled to the tune of 304%.
Now, AMD pushed its PC and server chip releases into 2017, but Polaris is pulling its weight with confidence in the meantime. Both Polaris and Pascal have the potential to reach brand-new markets, as their number-crunching powers happen to be very useful for supercomputing tasks such as real-time artificial intelligence and high-speed data analysis.
Will these turnarounds reach even higher highs next year? You tell me. AMD and NVIDIA must continue to execute in order to reach higher, which is hardly a guaranteed outcome if you've been following these companies for a few years. In particular, AMD cannot afford to flub its next processor launch, because graphics products account for less than one-third of AMD's overall sales. This launch will make or break the bulk of AMD's revenue stream.
So I'm staying away from both AMD and Nvidia here because I'm not terribly convinced that the smooth sailing will continue. And even if you disagree with my assessment of the investment risks involved, it would be reckless to back up the truck at this point. Momentum plays can be great while they last but they cannot last forever, you know.

Okay, so why do I feel like I stiffed myself by not buying more Netflix this year? The stock is only trading sideways year to date.
For starters, the ever-volatile stock took some dramatic dives in February and July. The first drop provided as much as a 30% discount, and the summer swoon stopped at roughly 28%. Share prices have recovered strongly from these troughs, mostly thanks to a rock-solid earnings report in October. If you bought Netflix shares on Feb. 8, you'd be enjoying a 52% return on that investment today.
That's still less impressive than AMD's or NVIDIA's soaring jumps, I know. But the thing is, it was always obvious that these Netflix discounts would be temporary. They were negative reactions to positive news, opening obvious buy-in windows. I'm feeling silly for letting these opportunities pass me by.
In February, Netflix had just achieved nearly worldwide coverage with its streaming video services. That's paving the way toward massive revenue and profit growth in the long run, but at the cost of high short-term expenses. Result: lower share prices for all the wrong, downright myopic reasons.
Then, the company reported fourth-quarter results where pretty much every business metric came in ahead of management's guidance targets. But traders focused on the small miss on domestic subscriber additions, complained about the high costs of rolling out a global service, and punished the stock some more. Again, for all the wrong reasons.
The same issues festered for months, weighing heavily on Netflix shares for no good reason. Another turn in soft subscriber additions followed in July, as consumers turned their attention to election coverage and the Rio Olympics instead of to Netflix content: obviously a short-lived issue, with a near-certain rebound coming up ahead.
More missed opportunities.
The third-quarter report in October swept away many of the cobwebs, and Netflix shares broke loose to new all-time highs. Yes, a $46 billion market cap can grow 20% larger overnight.
No more deep-discount buying windows.
Yes, I wish I had dipped just a little deeper into the Netflix well at some point in 2016. There was really no reason not to, and several blindingly obvious chances to make a move.
Netflix already accounts for about one-third of my total nest egg, so I'll console myself with the fact that I'm spreading my eggs across several baskets instead. But Netflix remains the best investment idea on the table today, and looks likely to make a big positive move in 2017 as management is shifting its focus from expansion to turning a profit.
I'm not exactly missing out on that jump, but I could have taken an even bigger position at a fantastic buy-in price.
Oh, well. Always forward.

The gaming sector has performed well in 2016, with many of the top names in the space, from Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) to chipmaker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), posting solid returns. Well-received new content, impressive new technology, and renewed ideas about how to get both of those to consumers have helped the sector grow this year. Here were some of the winners in 2016, and what the future could hold for these companies.

Of the content creators and licensors, Nintendo was the best-performing in its group in 2016, with more than a 50% rise through the year to date. Though it was up around 80% before a mid-December sell-off, the company has still had a remarkable year. Nintendo's resurgence follows the company's decision to finally develop a mobile strategy and bring its timeless characters and stories into a modern age.
Nintendo was one of the big winners with the Pokemon Go phenomenon that exploded worldwide this year, and the company announced a new game console called Switch to come out in 2017, which has helped to raise its stock price as well. Most recently, Nintendo launched a new mobile game called Super Mario Run, which topped the download charts during its first weekend, with around 5 million downloads its first day. The game has had some disappointing reviews so far, pushing Nintendo's YTD growth lower, but it's still the early days of Nintendo's new mobile game strategy, so it's certainly not game over yet.

Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) was also a top performer within the gaming content space, posting a 40% jump in share price this year. Take-Two, maker of popular games such as Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K17, has grown sales 21% in the most recent quarter, year over year. The company has also been able to adopt a more digitally focused strategy, which has helped margins so that, while earnings fell year over year, they were far above analyst estimates in the most recent quarter. 
Aside from the actual content creators, some gaming platform companies also performed well this year. Sony (NYSE:SNE) gets a spot on this list largely thanks to the launch of its PlayStation 4 gaming system and more recent launch of a premium virtual reality (VR) bundle that brings VR game play to mass-market gamers. Gaming makes up only about 20% of Sony's total revenue, but it's also its fastest-growing division and could help push the stock higher as more games for its VR headset come out in 2017.

In China, where video game sales are booming and there are an estimated 700 million mobile users and growing, local platform company NetEase (NASDAQ: NTES) has been a winner, with a 19% jump in share price this year. With an assortment of its own online games (among many online services from email to advertising), NetEase also has a deal with content companies such as Activision Blizzard to distribute its games across China, such as one of the hottest games this year, Overwatch, which has done very well in China.
While the content and the platforms for playing it on are the face of the gaming industry, the technology inside the devices -- be it gaming consoles, computers, or virtual reality headsets -- are chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA. These two companies have each made big plays so far in 2016, not just in gaming -- though that has been a growth driver for both companies, with each putting out new high-power chips for intense gaming -- but also in autonomous cars, artificial intelligence, connected devices within the Internet of things, and more. As a result of this growth, AMD and NVIDIA stocks are up 280% and 210%, respectively, year to date. 
While these content, platform, and chip companies did well this year as the gaming industry continued to grow, bricks-and-mortar video games and gaming hardware seller GameStop (NYSE: GME) had a rough year, which has pushed its stock down 8% so far in 2016. GameStop's business model has struggled to update amid a changing consumer landscape. Looking forward, this trend is likely to grow, as the gaming industry moves to a more e-commerce-focused market, and content creators continually seek a model of digital downloads. The companies with the best content and the most interesting technology are the ones to expect to lead growth in 2017.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will report a net loss this year, making 2016 the fifth consecutive year that AMD has failed to turn a profit. 2017 is shaping up to be better for AMD, with the launch of its new Ryzen CPUs and high-end Vega GPUs on the horizon. The success of those products will determine whether AMD will return to profitability next year and beyond.
AMD investors are no doubt looking forward to 2017, and the company made some good moves this year that have improved its chances of success. The balance sheet is stronger and its prospects are brighter thanks to AMD's best moves of 2016.

At the end of the first quarter of 2016, AMD's balance sheet was looking stretched. The company's cash balance was barely above $700 million, near the low end of its target range, and debt topped $2.2 billion. Book value had plunged to negative $500 million thanks to years of losses.
In April, AMD sold its semiconductor assembly and test assets into a joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, retaining a 15% stake and receiving about $320 million in cash, net of taxes and other expenses. This deal provided AMD with some much-needed cash as it was preparing to launch Polaris, its mainstream-orientated GPU.
Around the same time, AMD signed a deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. to form another JV, this one focused on bringing x86 server SoCs to the Chinese server market. AMD licensed its high-performance processor and SoC technology to the JV, receiving a $293 million licensing payment with the potential for additional royalty payments in the future.
These two deals greatly strengthened AMD's balance sheet, giving it the necessary resources to forge ahead with its turnaround plan.
Shares of AMD have soared this year, driven higher by optimism that the company's new products will drive revenue and earnings growth. The stock is up nearly 300% year to date, reflecting an extreme shift in investor sentiment.

AMD data by YCharts.
AMD took advantage of its soaring stock price in August when it announced that it was selling $600 million of new shares of its common stock, along with $700 million of 2.125% notes. The company planned to use the proceeds to knock down some of its debt, thus reducing its annual interest payments and making the path to profitability a little bit easier. AMD paid $160 million in interest payments in 2015.
AMD now has $1.26 billion of cash on its balance sheet, and it has reduced its total debt to about $1.63 billion. The company's financial situation, precarious earlier this year, is now much stronger, giving it the resources to launch its new CPUs and GPUs next year. Existing investors were diluted by the stock sale, but they should be thrilled that AMD used the opportunity to raise cash.
For those wanting to utilize graphics cards in the cloud, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has long been the only real option. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud all offer NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs exclusively. The company's focus over the past few years on deep learning and GPU compute has paid off. NVIDIA's data center business is nearing a $1 billion annual revenue run rate, with third-quarter sales nearly tripling year over year.
AMD's GPUs aren't available on any of those platforms, and it's fallen far behind NVIDIA in the market for accelerators. An analyst at Nomura estimates that NVIDIA controls 80% of the accelerator market, with AMD and Intel fighting for the scraps.

AMD made some headway in 2016. Alphabet's Google announced in November that it planned to offer AMD's FirePro GPUs through its cloud platform, along with NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs as well. While this is win for both AMD and NVIDIA, it narrows the gap a little between the two companies.
AMD built on this momentum with the announcement of Radeon Instinct in December, the company's upcoming line of graphics cards built specifically for deep learning. The company is playing catch-up in this area, but the potential opportunity to accelerate A.I. workloads is significant. NVIDIA is still the undisputed leader in the accelerator market, but AMD made some noise in 2016.

Tuesday is turning out to be a great day to be a tech investor. Earlier this morning, three big upgrades came out of Wall Street. First, Mizuho Securities upgraded AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) to buy, then Goldman Sachs followed with upgrades of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) to neutral -- and in the day's biggest move, upgraded NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock to conviction buy.
According to the analysts, AMD stock has the potential to rise 14% in value (new price target: $13). Western Digital, on the other hand, up 52% already since Goldman mistakenly put it on its sell list back in August, has probably peaked already (Goldman says it's worth only $68 a share). The strongest prospects of all, however, can be found at NVIDIA -- where Goldman believes the stock could shoot up a further 22% to a target price of $129 per share.
Here are three things you need to know.

Computer chip stocks are lighting up. Image source: Getty Images.
Let's begin with the day's biggest news. StreetInsider.com reports this morning that Goldman Sachs has added NVIDIA to its ""conviction buy list,"" citing the company's ability to benefit from ""positive secular trends in gaming, VR (virtual reality), AI (artificial intelligence)/ML (machine learning) and automotive."" According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, most analysts who follow the stock think NVIDIA will grow its earnings about 10% annually over the next five years -- but Goldman sees a whole lot more in store.
In particular, Goldman sees revenue from NVIDIA's data center business (i.e., storage) nearly doubling in fiscal 2018, and growing 53% again in fiscal 2019. (Here it's important to remember that NVIDIA operates on an accelerated financial calendar. Right now, we're in the middle of fiscal Q4 2017, so when Goldman talks about fiscal 2018, it really means next year -- 2017.) Gaming revenue, too, will be above-trend, with Goldman predicting 20% sales growth there next year, followed by 28% one year after.
Clearly, Goldman is expecting NVIDIA to grow a whole lot faster than anyone else out there, and the analyst predicts that ""estimate revisions [will] serve as a positive catalyst for the stock in the coming quarters"" as other analysts begin to realize that they were wrong, and Goldman Sachs was right. (Modesty has never been one of Goldman's defining virtues.)
That's actually kind of curious, given that at the same time as Goldman is loudly proclaiming its faith in NVIDIA stock, it's also fessing up to a pretty massive miss in its predictions for Western Digital. As Goldman admits, four months ago it told investors to sell Western Digital because the company was spending too much on capex, and building capacity to serve a NAND market that would be in critical ""oversupply"" by 2017.
Now however, Goldman says it was off base on that prediction. ""NAND prices for SSDs and retail may be up 5-10% qoq in 1Q17,"" says Goldman. In addition, a weak Japanese yen is likely to add close to 4% to Western Digital's gross margin this coming year. All this has led to a 52% spike in Western Digital's stock price since Goldman panned it.
Late to the party, Goldman is upgrading Western Digital -- but only to neutral, as the analyst expects to be proven right...eventually.
Meanwhile, elsewhere on Wall Street, analysts have been warming up to AMD stock for some weeks now. This morning, Mizuho Securities joined the club with an endorsement for AMD stock, agreeing that it sees potential in the company's ProGFx, Ryzen and Zen chips for applications in deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI).
Mizuho sees these markets powering AMD's gross margin in years to come. In fact, it sees gross margin potentially doubling from ""~30%"" to perhaps 60% as early as Q2 2017. Applying these margins to as much as $1 billion in incremental revenue from DL, the analyst believes AMD could earn as much as $0.30 in extra operating profit next year.
Granted, even if this prediction comes true, Mizuho still doesn't see AMD turning profitable next year, but only losing $0.05 per share instead of $0.06 per share. But looking out to 2018, the analyst believes AMD could be solidly profitable, and earning as much as $0.14 per share across its several businesses.
If true, that would be great news for AMD investors -- profits at last, after five straight years (and soon to be six) of losing money. On the other hand, even $0.14 per share in profits would result in about a 93 P/E ratio on the stock -- which both seems a mite high, and won't materialize for two more years at the earliest.
Going back through our list in reverse order, Western Digital is also currently unprofitable, and likely to end 2016 with a loss. But next year, analysts are forecasting $2.02 per share in earnings, valuing the stock at about 35 times forward earnings based on today's $70 share price. Given analyst expectations for 10% long-term earnings growth, this also seems expensive.
And finally, in true ""first shall be last"" fashion, we come to NVIDIA. Goldman Sachs has very high hopes for this one, as we've seen. Investors should note, however, that the consensus among analysts is still for NVIDIA to earn no more than $2.44 per share next year. At the stock's current price of $105 and change, that works out to a forward P/E ratio of 43. Much as I like NVIDIA as a business, the stock still looks too rich for my blood.
Honestly, Wall Street may love all these stocks -- but I wouldn't touch any one of them.

Though there are certainly some challengers, it's hard to find a hotter tech stock than Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Heading into the finish line for 2016, AMD stock has risen an astronomical 275% in 2016, roughly 34 times the Nasdaq Composite's respectable 8% uptick for the year:

AMD data by YCharts.
No stock rises so fast without an underlying catalyst, and that is indeed the case with AMD shares. The company has done an admirable job making the most of its unique exposure to the computer microprocessor (CPU) and graphics (GPU) markets. So if AMD is doing so well, why is this article about better alternatives to its stock?
Despite its recent renaissance, AMD's business model isn't necessarily as bulletproof as its 2016 rally might imply. As you'll see, other semiconductor makers hold stronger competitive positions in the two core markets where AMD hopes to gain market share. Consequently, here are two better semiconductor stocks than AMD today.
After struggling to find a place in the mobile revolution, graphics processing unit (GPU) leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has found itself unexpectedly at the heart of some of the most exciting growth markets in tech today. Self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and big data might sound like buzz words to some, but to NVIDIA, they're core markets for its high-end graphics chips. In fact, NVIDIA saw double-digit growth in the three business segments that cater to these markets. In terms of being more attractive than AMD, this leadership position in higher-growth semiconductor markets would be enough to make NVIDIA the better buy.

However, NVIDIA remains better positioned in the market where it competes directly with AMD, despite recent success on AMD's part. It's no secret that AMD has stolen some of NVIDIA's market share for desktop GPUs, but this overlooks two important facts. First, the overall market for PC graphics chips is shrinking in terms of unit shipments, making AMD's success in this space somewhat less appealing. What is more, NVIDIA's popularity among gamers, an enthusiast market that covets top-notch performance, has allowed it to continue to increase costs in the face of falling PC sales. Furthermore, NVIDIA is rumored to be preparing a lower-cost graphics chip to defend its market share from AMD next year. So for long-term investors comparing the two, NVIDIA is a better choice.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) dominates the market for PC and server microprocessors, and a meaningful part of AMD's recent rally has been fueled by the assumption that AMD can steal some market share from Intel in one or both of these industries.
Much has been made of AMD's forthcoming Zen CPU, which could offer graphics advantages over Intel's current chips, as Intel's chip roadmap appears focused on driving computing-performance improvements as usual. It still seems more likely that consumer preferences will be biased toward valuing faster computing power over moderately improved graphics.
Looking at the bigger picture, Intel's massive resource advantage over AMD -- Intel's research-and-development budget is larger than AMD's total revenues  -- should insulate it from individual design wins that might translate into a longer-term shift away from its chips. Intel might not be the growth giant that it was a generation ago, but in my eyes its financial muscle and strong tradition of execution still make it a safer long-term bet than AMD's high-flying shares.
In many ways, this article is as much an argument for NVIDIA and Intel shares as it is a caution against AMD stock. As a company, AMD is undoubtedly improving. AMD has adeptly tapped into its core opportunity in the console gaming market, while looking to position its mix of computing and graphics know-how as an alternative to NVIDIA and Intel in their respective markets.
Though this strategy could certainly work, it will be hard to dislodge either NVIDIA or Intel from their respective positions of strength. As we've seen in other consumer-hardware verticals like the PC market, cost advantages rarely trump performance advantages, so in this way AMD remains at a disadvantage to both Intel and NVIDIA.
What's more, we're still early in AMD's comeback story, and the company has fallen badly on its face in the past. So while AMD shares have eviscerated the market over the past 12 months, it's far less clear that the company can do so again over the next 12.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have soared a staggering 280% year to date. The company is still unprofitable, but investors are betting that AMD is on the verge of a historic turnaround. Polaris, AMD's mainstream-oriented GPU, launched earlier this year, producing growth in the company's core business after a long streak of disappointing results. AMD is set to re-enter the high-end GPU market next year with Vega, and its Ryzen CPU, formerly known as Zen, will look to challenge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) during the first quarter.

AMD data by YCharts.
AMD has also seen some momentum in an area that has been so far dominated by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Alphabet's Google announced last month that it planned to install both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs into its data centers, offering them as part of its cloud platform. While NVIDIA's products are already available through most of the major cloud-computing vendors, AMD has been slower out of the gate, making the Google deal a significant win for the company. Radeon Instinct, a new line of graphics cards aimed at machine learning set to launch in 2017, will put AMD in the running to power artificial intelligence workloads.
With such a large gain in such a short period of time, investors are right to ask: Can it last? If everything goes right for AMD next year, the stock could be in for further gains. But it won't take much going wrong for 2017 to be a bad year for the stock, even if it's a relatively good year for the company. Here are three reasons AMD stock could fall next year.

Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
Looking at AMD's stock chart tells a story of extreme optimism followed by disappointment. Shares of AMD have spiked before, in the early 2000s and again around 2006, only to collapse when the company failed to deliver. The company's current market capitalization isn't yet at an all-time high, but it's at the highest level in nearly a decade.

AMD Operating Income (Annual) data by YCharts.
In AMD's best year in the past 10, the company managed to earn a net income of about $500 million. The market is currently valuing AMD at around 20 times that number. In other words, investors are not only betting that AMD will make a comeback, but that its profits will soar to record levels. That's a bold bet for a company that has a long history of disappointing investors.
This time could be different. AMD has a semi-custom business that's producing profits for the company, and it appears that Ryzen could give Intel a run for its money. But if the bull case doesn't unfold exactly as expected, a major correction could sting investors next year.
Polaris produced some growth for AMD, with its computing and graphics segment revenue jumping 11% year over year during the third quarter. But NVIDIA stole the show, registering 63% growth in its gaming segment, driven by its new Pascal graphics cards. Both companies benefited from strong demand for graphics cards during the quarter, but NVIDIA claimed a bigger piece of the pie.
Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform, collects hardware data from its users, and the most recent results suggest that NVIDIA's dominance isn't going away. The only Polaris graphics card to register on the survey is the RX 480, which claimed just 0.37% of Steam users in November. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's GTX 1080, 1070, and 1060, all higher-end cards launched around the same time, were being used by 0.86%, 1.59%, and 1.53% of users, respectively.
AMD plans to launch more powerful graphics cards based on its upcoming Vega GPU next year, hoping to challenge NVIDIA in the high-margin high end of the market. AMD is certainly in a better competitive position today than it was in a year ago, but Polaris hasn't been the runaway success that the company needed it to be. Vega will need to be a home run. If it's not, AMD investors could be in for a rough ride next year.
AMD recently provided details on Ryzen, its upcoming line of CPUs formerly known as Zen. Ryzen processors for desktops are expected to be available during the first quarter of 2017, with notebook variants coming during the second half. The company demonstrated that an eight-core version of Ryzen matched or beat Intel's i7 6900K in a few tasks, including image rendering and video transcoding.
Ryzen comes with some new features, including improved prefetching driven by learning algorithms meant to minimize bottlenecks, and a refined boost system that allows clock speeds to be adjusted. It's built on a 14-nanometer FinFET process, meaning that the manufacturing gap between AMD and Intel is at its narrowest in years. If Ryzen is competitive on a performance-per-dollar basis with Intel's chips, AMD could gain a meaningful amount of market share.
The only benchmarks we've seen so far have been from AMD, and at this point we know nothing about the more mainstream versions of Ryzen or the pricing. Ryzen needs to offer a compelling value proposition to compel Intel users to switch, and we won't know if that's the case until third-party benchmarks and pricing details surface. Even with Ryzen looking like it's going to be a competitive product, anything short of significant market share gains for AMD could send the stock tumbling.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is on a massive roll right now. Share prices have more than quadrupled over the last 52 weeks, and AMD stock is trading at prices not seen since 2007.
Investors are loving this rare return to form, but is it too late to jump aboard the AMD bandwagon? Let's have a deeper look at the risks involved in an AMD investment.
There's no doubt AMD has done a lot of things right in 2016. The company deserves kudos for the strong launch of a new graphics platform formerly known as Polaris. Even though graphics-segment arch-rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also bowed a fresh graphics platform to an equally warm welcome, Polaris chips made AMD an instant challenger in the supercomputing and data center markets. Yes, chips designed to handle digital graphics tasks happen to be great at other forms of intense number-crunching as well. So Polaris has opened a bunch of new doors for AMD.
In the words of CEO Lisa Su, AMD is now a high-performance computing company more than anything else. She is aiming her Polaris platform at a global market worth about $50 billion a year, including data center servers and immersive digital experiences. The company is only getting started on a multiyear roadmap, which includes a new general processing architecture launch in 2017.
These are the reasons AMD shares are trading near decade-spanning record prices today.
The shift into high-performance computing has not been completely smooth. Along the way, NVIDIA won the lucrative contract to power the next Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) console. Nintendo has been in AMD's pocket since the original Wii system, helping the company keep its proverbial nose above the water in recent years.
NVIDIA might also pose a serious challenge when the other console builders get around to launching the next generation of hardware systems. If so, about half of AMD's current revenue sources could be headed to NVIDIA instead. Sure, AMD could still win those contracts and keep its sales streams fairly intact, but losing Nintendo is not a positive sign in the early going. Investors must be prepared for the potential of a big setback here.
The thing is, investors are acting as if AMD were set up to deliver a steady stream of sustainable profits from here on out. And that's not even remotely true.
The company only occasionally manages to deliver positive operating profits, EBITDA earnings, or free cash flows. In general, you can expect the bottom-line numbers to show up deeply in the red. The overall trend isn't even positive.
AMD is sacrificing top-line revenue to explore new markets. That kind of move is usually expected to come with stronger profit margins, but not in AMD's case. Buying this stock today -- or holding on to your existing shares -- amounts to a bet on AMD's future prospects. The Polaris-based graphics boost needs to have legs, or the bottom falls out. On top of that, it's not enough to just maintain whatever positive trends the company has on the table today. AMD is still losing money by the bucketful, and it needs to tighten up the leaking ship.
Deliver on all of these promises, and AMD shares will hold steady -- or maybe rise even higher. Fall short anywhere at all, and that's the end of the new golden era.
Yes, this stock could skyrocket over the next several years if management executes flawlessly. But in my view, the chances of that happening are slim to none. It's a small boat in a big sea, surrounded on all sides by rivals with more experience and stronger balance sheets. AMD simply can't afford any mistakes, and perfection doesn't come easy.
Long story short, AMD investors will need an iron stomach.

Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) stock price has skyrocketed in 2016, jumping more than 260% since the beginning of the year. But this year brought more than just stock price gains for the company. 
AMD's revenues bounced back this year from one of their lowest points last year, and the company managed to expand its discrete desktop GPU market share against rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) as well. Additionally, AMD is poised to benefit from the expanding virtual reality market. 
Here's how all of this looks for AMD in three charts.
AMD's revenue has fallen about 28% from its five-year high, and it now sit at about $1.3 billion in the most recent quarter. But while the company is far below its five-year high, AMD's revenues are starting to move back in the right direction. The second and third quarters both saw positive revenue gains on a year-over-year basis, with the biggest jump -- 23% -- coming in the third quarter.

Much of the growth came from four straight quarters of growth in the company's professional graphics products. Investors should know that fourth-quarter revenues are expected to decline on a sequential basis as the company moves away from its usual ""annual semi custom sales peak in the third quarter."" But even with that decline, fourth-quarter revenue is expected to increase 12% year over year at the midpoint of guidance. 
AMD expects revenue to be up just 6% for full-year 2016. Investors should keep a close eye on the company's ability grow sales -- and whether it can continue pushing revenue back in the right direction as AMD heads into the new year. 
Another bright spot for AMD right now is the company's discrete desktop GPU market share. The company's graphics processors compete directly with NVIDIA, and while AMD is still an underdog, it's starting to gain momentum. 
Last year, AMD had fallen to about 18% market share, but it's slowly ticked up since then and now stands at about an estimated 30%.

AMD still has a long way to go to best NVIDIA's GPUs, but with the GPU market essentially a two-player game at this point, any gains AMD makes in the space should directly help the company's revenues. 
The virtual reality (VR) market is just getting started, but AMD is in fantastic position to benefit. Here's what the virtual reality opportunity looks like over the next few years, as combined sales of hardware and software jump from under $5 billion in 2016 to an estimated $40 billion by 2020 .

AMD's opportunity lies in its graphics cards for VR-ready computers, but also in its sales of GPUs for gaming consoles, like Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 4. Sony is shaping up to be a major player in the VR space. The company recently released its VR headset that's compatible with the PS4, PS4 Slim, and upgraded PS4 Pro, and it has already sold more than 50 million PS4 consoles to date. 
The company's new VR headset could help spur even more sales of the PS4 lineup, which would then boost sales of AMD's processors. With Sony teaming up with 230 developers and releasing new VR games and content, AMD is in the perfect position to benefit. 
While AMD has had a rough few years of falling revenue and discrete desktop GPU market share, the company appears to be making up for lost time. If it can can continue on this path -- and benefit from the rise of VR as well -- then AMD investors can expect another promising year from the company.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) made headlines on Monday with the introduction of Radeon Instinct, a line of GPU accelerators aimed specifically at deep learning systems. The company has offered products targeting data centers and high-performance computing for years with its FirePro graphics cards. But Radeon Instinct, along with the MIOpen open-source software that AMD announced alongside the new products, marks a shift in the company's strategy.

Radeon Instinct will come in three flavors. The MI6 is based on AMD's Polaris GPU architecture, which powers the mainstream gaming graphics cards the company launched earlier this year. This card is aimed at neural network inference, where a trained neural network is used for an application. The MI8 is based on AMD's old Fiji architecture, featuring greater processing power and memory bandwidth, but a quarter of the memory. This card is also likely aimed at inference.
The MI25 is the big daddy of the bunch. Built around AMD's upcoming Vega GPU architecture, which will power the company's high-end gaming graphics cards next year, the MI25 offers a whopping 25 TFLOPs of half-precision floating-point performance. This card is aimed at neural network training, a more computationally intensive process than inference. For comparison, NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) P100 Tesla GPU clocks in at 21.2 TFLOPS in the best-case scenario, using the company's homegrown NVLink technology instead of standard PCIe.
Radeon Instinct products are expected to begin shipping during the first half of 2017. This news comes about one month after AMD scored a big data center win, with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google announcing that it would integrate the company's FirePro graphics cards into its cloud platform. Despite this apparent momentum, AMD remains far behind NVIDIA in the data center market generally and the A.I. acceleration market specifically. With additional competition from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)and even Google itself, it won't be smooth sailing for AMD.
NVIDIA has been talking about deep learning for years. The company's data center business is booming thanks to that early focus, closing in on a $1 billion annual run rate after tripling revenue year-over-year during the third quarter.

Image source: NVIDIA.
NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs are already offered by most of the major cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud. AMD's GPUs are absent from all three. Google will be adding NVIDIA's GPUs to its cloud platform along with AMD's, so while that announcement was a big win for AMD, it was also a win for NVIDIA.
According to an analyst at Nomura, NVIDIA enjoys an 80% share of the accelerator market. A vast amount of software has been ported to run on NVIDIA's GPUs, ranging from computational finance to scientific simulations, creating switching costs for those already using its products. The market for A.I. acceleration is still in its infancy, meaning that AMD is not incapable of catching up. But NVIDIA has a clear lead.
Intel has been trying to break into the accelerator market for years with its Xeon Phi line of products. The most recent, Knights Landing, has the advantage of acting as the main processor as well, offering customers potential costs savings. Intel stated earlier this year that it was aiming to move 100,000 units in 2016, a number that would make the product a major force in the accelerator market.
Intel is planning to launch a version of Xeon Phi, Knights Mill, aimed specifically at deep learning. Knights Mill will also feature the ability to act as the main processor when it launches next year, giving NVIDIA some serious competition in the A.I. acceleration market in addition to AMD's upcoming products.

Image source: Intel.
Google may pose a threat to all three companies in the long run. The search giant announced earlier this year that it had designed an application-specific-integrated-circuit in an effort to accelerate deep learnings tasks. Google is reportedly using more than 1,000 of the Tensor Processing Units in its data centers already.
In the same way that a GPU is more efficient than a CPU at graphics processing because it's designed at the hardware level for the kind of math involved, Google's TPU is more efficient than a GPU for inference because it's designed at the hardware level for that task. Google claims that its TPUs provide and order-of-magnitude improvement in performance per watt compared to GPUs.
AMD is playing catch up when it comes to deep learning. Like NVIDIA, AMD is betting that GPUs are the future of A.I. acceleration. But ASICs like Google's TPU could upend both companies' long-term plans. If other cloud computing vendors move to design their own custom chips for deep learning, the GPU vendors could be left out in the cold.
AMD's Radeon Instinct is the company's first real attempt at going after NVIDIA in the A.I. acceleration market. If the company can price the cards competitively, it could be a very profitable endeavor. But the threat of Intel is looming, and the potential for custom chips to eventually displace GPUs is very real. AMD investors should be happy that the company is taking deep learning seriously. But they also shouldn't get ahead of themselves.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 23.2% in November, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The big news during the month was an announcement from Alphabet's Google that it was installing both AMD and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs in its cloud data centers.
NVIDIA has had great success getting cloud computing companies to buy its pricey Tesla GPUs. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud already offer GPU cloud computing services via NVIDIA's products. Google's announcement, which will put AMD's FirePro S9300 x2 and two NVIDIA Telsa GPUs on offer through its cloud platform beginning next year, is a significant win for both companies.
NVIDIA's data center business is now at an annual run rate of nearly $1 billion, while AMD doesn't break out data center revenue. The opportunity for AMD is immense if the company can continue to win cloud computing deals. An analyst last month estimated that artificial intelligence offers a $15 billion opportunity for semiconductor companies. Even grabbing a fraction of that total would be a boon for AMD.
AMD stock has been on a tear this year, driven by growing optimism that the company is finally on the verge of turning things around. The launch of its mainstream Polaris graphics cards earlier this year has produced revenue growth in its core computing and graphics business, but the company remains unprofitable. Next year, AMD will launch new Zen CPUs and Vega high-end GPUs, both of which will need to be successful for the company to grow into its valuation.

More good news in December has pushed shares of AMD even higher. A rumor emerged on Dec. 6 that AMD and Intel had signed a licensing agreement that would put AMD's GPU technology into Intel's CPUs. There's been no confirmation of any deal at this point, but it's possible that this deal will replace a cross-licensing agreement between Intel and NVIDIA that expires early next year. If that's the case, AMD could see annual payments from Intel. However, AMD graphics showing up in Intel CPUs seems unlikely.
2017 will be a big year for AMD, with the ultimate success of its turnaround set to be determined by the launch of new products. The Google deal in November was a positive, but the company remains far behind NVIDIA.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has been one of the best performing tech stocks this year, surging over 230% and crushing the NASDAQ's 8% gain. However, these five catalysts could drive the stock even higher in 2017.

Image source: AMD.
AMD's turnaround in 2016 was fueled by robust sales of its semi-custom SoCs (system on chips) for Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. That turned the EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit into its core pillar of growth, and offset declines at its Computing and Graphics unit. 
That shift boosted AMD's quarterly revenue by 8% annually during the second quarter this year (its first quarter of positive year-over-year growth in two years) and another 23% during the third quarter. That turnaround also lifted its non-GAAP earnings back into the black. Analysts now believe that AMD can finish this year with 6% sales growth, compared to a 28% decline in 2015. 
Console sales often wane after the first year, but Sony and Microsoft are both updating their consoles with slimmer form factors and beefier specs for 4K and VR gaming. These new versions should continue supporting AMD's EESC unit in 2017 and beyond.
Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive piqued consumer interest in high-end VR games for PCs, but many current PCs aren't powerful enough for those headsets. The initial batch of ""VR ready"" PCs cost around $1,000, but AMD reduced that price to about $600 with its RX 480 graphics cards.

RX 480. Image source: AMD. 
The Rift and Vive are still pricey, with respective price tags of $600 and $800, but those prices should come down next year as component prices decline and competition from mobile and console-based headsets heats up. When that happens, demand for AMD's low-end ""VR ready"" cards could rise and finally help it push back against market leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, NVIDIA is also eyeing the same market with competitively priced VR ready cards like the GTX 1060.
AMD also plans to launch its next-gen Vega GPUs in the near future. Leaked specs indicate that the Vega 10 will boast 12 teraflops of processing power, which outperforms the 11 teraflops squeezed out by NVIDIA's $1,200 GTX Titan X. 
If AMD sticks with its strategy of selling cards at lower price points than NVIDIA, it might just win back some high-end users. But it's still a long road back -- research firm JPR claims that AMD controlled just 29% of the add-in board market in the third quarter, compared to NVIDIA's 71% share. NVIDIA also spent 44% more on R&D than AMD last quarter, indicating that it could quickly match the Vega challengers with its own next-gen chipsets.
Over the past few years, AMD was marginalized in the x86 CPU market by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD offered cheaper chips, but Intel's Core CPUs crushed AMD's in terms of single-threaded performance (which is crucial for high-end gaming). According to PassMark GPU benchmarks, Intel CPUs now account for 83% of the x86 market, while AMD CPUs account for 17%. That loss of market share, exacerbated by sluggish demand for PCs, caused AMD's x86 business to become a dead weight.
However, AMD doesn't plan to simply surrender this market to Intel. Its long-awaited Zen CPUs, which are scheduled to arrive early next year, promise to offer better single-threaded performance for game engines and improved multi-threaded performance for newer graphics APIs. Depending on how competitively they're priced against Intel's high-end Core i5 and i7 offerings, the Zen might help AMD finally regain some lost market share in the tough x86 market.
AMD is constantly cited as a potential takeover target for bigger chipmakers. Its enterprise value of $8.4 billion is fairly low compared to other chipmakers, and it's the only remaining licensee of x86 chips.
Intel, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Oracle, and even Microsoft were named as potential suitors before, but no concrete talks have ever emerged. With the semiconductor market consolidating rapidly and AMD's finances improving, a hostile bidding war could theoretically erupt over the chipmaker in the near future. If that happens, we could see some big premium offers since AMD only trades at 2 times sales. By comparison, Intel and Qualcomm respectively have P/S ratios of 3 and 4.
At the beginning of the year, I questioned AMD's ability to survive its market share losses, sales declines, and rising debt. But under CEO Lisa Su, the chipmaker wisely used robust growth in its EESC unit to support the development of new chipsets to challenge NVIDIA and Intel. While it will still be tough to reclaim market share from those bigger rivals, AMD has given investors fresh hope that its stock could keep rising over the next few years.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped on Thursday due to an analyst upgrade that featured a significant price target boost. The upgrade comes after a string of positive news for AMD, including a cloud computing deal and rumors of a licensing pact with Intel. The stock rose as much as 11.5% on the news of the upgrade, settling into an 8.3% gain by 2:30 p.m. EST
Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded AMD from underperform to buy on Thursday, citing turnaround progress and a massive opportunity ahead of it as it looks to challenge both Intel and NVIDIA. Success in semi-custom chips was also a factor in the upgrade. While AMD's core CPU and GPU business has been posting losses for quite some time, semi-custom chips powering all of the major game consoles have provided a much-needed source of revenue and profits for the company.
Merrill Lynch assigned a $12 price target to shares of AMD, with a $15-plus bull case target and a $7 bear case target. AMD stock has rocketed higher this year on the hope that its new GPU and CPU products would propel the company back to profitability. That hasn't happened yet, but Merrill Lynch sees a growth opportunity for the company that is ""too large to ignore.""

This is the third time in recent weeks that shares of AMD have surged on a positive piece of news. The stock jumped in mid-November when Alphabet's Google announced that it was adding both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs to its cloud platform. AMD is far behind NVIDIA when it comes to getting its server GPUs into cloud data centers, so the deal was a meaningful win for the company.
Another jump came earlier this week when a rumor emerged that AMD had signed a licensing deal with Intel to put its GPU technology into Intel processors. The deal has not yet been confirmed, and it may simply replace a licensing deal between Intel and NVIDIA that expires next year. An annual payment to AMD may be in the cards, but the prospect of Intel using AMD's GPUs in its processors seems unlikely.
A flurry of good news has pushed AMD stock higher in the past month. The company will need to deliver next year when it launches its Zen CPUs and Vega GPUs in order to justify its higher valuation.

Economist John Maynard Keynes is generally credited with the quote, ""When the facts change, I change my mind."" Today, it's Merrill Lynch (CAPS rating: 93.93) that is putting the quote into practice.
According to StreetInsider.com, it's been more than two years since Bank of America's Merrill Lynch brokerage unit downgraded semiconductor chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to underperform, assigning the stock a $4 price target on worries that the perpetually underperforming AMD just couldn't effectively compete with rivals such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Since that rating came out, however, AMD shares have not fallen, but instead climbed to nearly $10 as of this writing. And with this ""fact"" having changed, Merrill Lynch has decided to change its opinion of AMD stock today -- and upgraded the stock two notches, from underperform to buy.
Here are three things you need to know about that upgrade.
Merrill Lynch ponders the future of ""deep learning"" computers, and has a rethink about AMD stock. Image source: Getty Images.
In a rare mea culpa, Merrill Lynch admitted today that it missed out on the turnaround in AMD's business -- and in its stock price earlier this year.
Quoted on TheFly.com this morning, the banker explains that it was ""too concerned"" about AMD's history of ""weak execution, high debt, and competitive risks"" from Intel and NVIDIA. In focusing on the company's disappointing history, Merrill says it may have missed the unfolding story of AMD's rising strength in PC gaming, artificial intelligence, and computer deep learning. AMD's progress in these areas, says Merrill, has led to gains in chip market share for AMD.
At the same time, Merrill Lynch gives AMD's new CEO Lisa Su credit for shoring up AMD's balance sheet. With nearly $1.3 billion in cash on its books, S&P Global Market Intelligence data show that AMD has grown its cash reserves by roughly 25% since Merrill Lynch first downgraded it back in July of 2014. At the same time, AMD has shrunk its long-term indebtedness to just $1.6 billion.
Result: Cash on hand is nearly sufficient to balance out debt at AMD, and at the same time, says Merrill, AMD has succeeded in refinancing the debt it still carries, pushing out its due date and giving the firm breathing room as it continues to build cash.
Factoring all these improvements into consideration, Merrill Lynch says that the same AMD stock it previously thought to be worth only $4 is now worth three times more -- $12 a share. And with AMD stock still selling for less than $10 a share today, that means there's more than 20% upside in the stock.
But is Merrill Lynch right about that?
That's really hard to say, because while AMD's improvements are obvious, it's still not obvious that AMD stock is a better buy than Intel or NVIDIA, say.
Debt may be down and cash may be up, but S&P Global data show that AMD is still burning cash at the rate of $127 million a year. Under GAAP accounting standards, the stock looks even worse, with net losses of $548 million over the past 12 months. In contrast, both Intel and NVIDIA are GAAP-profitable companies, and both are generating not just positive free cash flow, but free cash flow actually superior to their reported GAAP profits -- $10.6 billion in FCF for Intel, and $1.2 billion for NVIDIA, over the past 12 months.
Long story short: I can't deny that AMD has made improvements in its business. I cannot say that Merrill Lynch is wrong when it peers into the future, sees these improvements continuing, and believes that despite its losses and despite its cash burn, AMD has a bright future ahead of it. All I can do is point to the multiple instances when other analysts have predicted similar turnarounds for AMD -- and been proven wrong.
AMD's financial picture looks a whole lot prettier today than it did just two years ago, but Intel and NVIDIA aren't sitting still, and AMD still has a long way to go to make up the gap between it and its more successful rivals. To cite another famous quote, I'm still not convinced that this leopard has changed its spots.

            ","With the market hovering near historic highs, it seems tough to find stocks with much upside potential. However, just because a stock surged over the past year doesn't mean that it will run out of steam next year. Let's take a look at three tech stocks which rallied in 2016 but might make investors even richer in 2017 -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), MeetMe (NASDAQ:MEET), and Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB).

Image source: Getty Images.
AMD seemed doomed earlier this year as its stock fell below $2. Intel was crushing its CPU business, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) was marginalizing its GPU business. But the chipmaker bounced back on the strength of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which produced SoCs for non-PC platforms like gaming consoles, including the PS4 and Xbox One.
Robust sales of those consoles helped AMD post 8% annual sales growth during its second quarter earnings in July -- marking its first quarter of positive year-over-year revenue growth in two years. It followed that up with 23% annual growth in the third quarter and a return to non-GAAP profitability. 
AMD is now fighting back against NVIDIA with new low-end ""VR ready"" GPUs, and its upcoming Vega chipset could challenge NVIDIA in the high-end market. It also plans to take on Intel's x86 dominance with its powerful new Zen CPUs early next year. AMD's success definitely isn't guaranteed in either market, but analysts believe that it could post 7% sales growth and a non-GAAP profit next year. If AMD can exceed those expectations, it could have much more room to run despite rallying over 220% in 2016.
MeetMe's social networking app helps users find new people to chat with. The small cap company, which acquired rival platform Skout earlier this year, had over 8.5 million monthly active users (MAUs) at the end of last quarter. That seems tiny compared to Match Group's Tinder, which has around 50 million MAUs, but MeetMe has a robust presence among millennials and is rapidly growing.

The app's mobile MAUs rose 32% year-over-year last quarter, and its mobile revenue soared 39% to $16 million. Total revenues, mainly generated by in-app ads, grew 20% to $17.2 million. Non-GAAP earnings rose 30% to $6.2 million, GAAP earnings surged 316% to $4.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA improved 31%. 
Analysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to respectively rise 38% and 17% next year. MeetMe already advanced nearly 40% this year, but it still trades at less than 7 times earnings, compared to the average P/E of 50 for internet information providers. MeetMe's growth might eventually peak, but I believe that its stock could still double or triple from current levels if its growth stays consistent. 
Carbonite offers cloud backup services for SMBs (small and medium sized businesses) with fewer than 300 employees. The cloud backup space might seem crowded, but market behemoths like Microsoft and IBM generally focus on large enterprises instead of SMBs. 
This enabled Carbonite -- which beefed up by acquiring Seagate's EVault cloud backup service in January -- to carve out a growing niche in the SMB market. Carbonite's revenue grew a whopping 50% annually to $51.9 million last quarter, and non-GAAP net income rose 80% to $3.8 million. The company also generated a slim GAAP net profit of $107,000, compared to a loss of nearly $6 million in the prior year quarter. Its adjusted free cash flow more than tripled to $4.5 million.
Much of Carbonite's growth this year was inflated by the EVault acquisition, but analysts still expect it to post 7% sales growth and 19% earnings growth next year. Carbonite already rallied nearly 90% this year, but it still trades at 27 times forward earnings -- which remains lower than its industry average of 29. 
AMD, MeetMe, and Carbonite all crushed the market in 2016, and they could continue to do so next year. However, all three companies face clear headwinds -- AMD's efforts against Intel and NVIDIA could flop, MeetMe could be crushed by Tinder, and Carbonite could be marginalized by its larger rivals. But if they overcome those challenges, these stocks could continue soaring and make investors very happy.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged on Tuesday after a rumor emerged that AMD and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had signed a deal involving AMD's Radeon graphics technology. AMD stock was up about 9.9% at 3 p.m. EST, while Intel stock was up about 1%.
The rumors of a deal between AMD and Intel first emerged in a forum post from Kyle Bennett, chief editor at HardOCP. According to Bennett, Intel is licensing AMD's graphics technology with plans to integrate it into future processors.
Intel and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) currently have a cross-licensing agreement that gives Intel access to some of NVIDIA's patents, but it expires in early 2017. There has been no news regarding a renewal of this agreement, and it's possible that Intel has instead signed a similar deal with AMD. It's unclear if the agreement, if it turns out to be more than a rumor, will involve cash payments.
Speculation that Intel will use AMD's GPU's in its processors is probably unfounded. The most likely scenario is that a deal between AMD and Intel is simply a replacement for the NVIDIA deal.
The jump in AMD's stock price is based on sparse rumors; nothing has been confirmed by anyone at this point. A deal may involve payments to AMD, which would shore up the company's balance sheet as it prepares to launch its Zen processors next year. But the idea that Intel is going to use AMD's GPUs in its processors seems far-fetched to me.
In any event, this is probably good news for AMD and, depending on the nature of the deal, bad news for NVIDIA. But we'll need to wait for more information to know for sure.

It's the classic story of David versus Goliath. Or, it used to be -- but things have been changing lately. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) aren't the unambiguous head-to-head rivals they used to be.
So, what's new in this storied matchup, and which stock should you buy today?
Let's find out.
If you're looking for massive market momentum, there is no contest, here. Intel has traded roughly in line with the S&P 500 over the last year, but AMD shares have tripled year to date and nearly quadrupled over the last 52 weeks.
Image source: AMD.
Of course, AMD started that climb from a deep, dark well.
Six years ago, AMD shares traded at $7.50 per share. The next five years saw AMD sliding 70% lower, landing at $2.22 in November, 2015. Revenues were plunging and the company was burning enormous amounts of cash. Weak PC sales and a soft market for video game consoles added up to bad news for AMD investors.
By 2015, it was not obvious that AMD would avoid a bankruptcy in the long run.
After a false start based on unproven buyout rumors, AMD started a real comeback in January. A solid fourth-quarter report was followed by three positive earnings surprises. The company launched an all-new graphics chip architecture to wide acclaim, and investors are looking forward to an equally radical redesign of AMD's PC processor cores in early 2017.
Once left for dead, AMD now looks like a vital business with a serious shot at revenue growth and steady profits. That's how the stock reached today's high levels.
From here, even the bulls think the stock looks fairly valued. Buy ratings are based on future revenue growth, not expanding valuation ratios. The upcoming launch of the Zen processor architecture will be a make-or-break moment for AMD. The company did a good job with the Polaris graphics platform, which improves the odds for a decent Zen introduction.
Still, AMD remains a risky bet until the company can get a truly solid financial footing again. Zen is going up against Intel's best server and desktop chips, and that's always a daunting challenge. At this point, I'm happy to stay on the sidelines and wait for the Zen introduction. Makes no sense to make a blind bet on a dark horse, after all.
If 2016 was a year of transition for AMD, the same was also true for Intel.
The chip giant reduced its headcount by 11% this year, then installed a new CFO and decided to spin off its security operations under the McAfee brand. Intel continued to exceed earnings estimates at every beat, but gloomy guidance led to a dramatic haircut in January.

However, Intel is a far larger and more stable business than AMD. The last four quarters generated $10.5 billion of free cash flows, even though Intel is ramping up its capital expenses again. This company has the financial freedom to take chances and try out new markets without betting the entire farm.
The revamped strategy points to data center servers and the Internet of Things. The traditional PC market will continue to shrink, but Intel is making up for that drag with improvements in those two core markets.
Would I add more Intel shares to my existing holdings at today's prices? Maybe not. The stock is riding relatively high at the moment, just short of the multiyear highs Intel reached in October. For the moment, I'm happy to stick with the shares I already own.
That being said, I just might take another dip into Intel shares the next time this high-quality stock takes a sharp fall for no good reason. It happens more often than you'd think.
The high-stakes gamblers out there might want to take a deeper look at AMD. For the rest of us, Intel is the lower-risk way to go.

            ","A stock's value is not indicated by its market price. The profitability of a specific company compared with how many shares it has outstanding is what matters, meaning that a stock trading below $10 could be more valuable than a stock trading at $100 if there is more profitability per share to be expected in the future or some other benefit such as high dividend yield.
That said, sometimes there is value to be found in looking at stocks that have been beaten up by the market and could still have the potential for future gains. Here are few of those downtrodden stocks that could make nice little positions in a diversified portfolio.  
Fitbit Inc. (NYSE:FIT) stock was crushed in late October, when the company's disappointing Q3 earnings report guided for a lousy fourth quarter, a time when holiday sales usually mean upward revisions. For the third quarter itself, even though sales grew 23% year over year, net income was cut nearly in half, and sales growth was far slower than in years past.

However, while those figures look grim, the company is still the global leader in wearables, and its market share ticked slightly upward in the most recent figures from the IDC, the leading source of wearables market share data. Fitbit's new products have all been more or less upgrades to its basic product, a wrist-based tracker, but the company has begun to massively increase spending on research and development, which was up more than 150% in Q3 year over year, and could mean future products that help diversify revenue. Additionally, Fitbit looks to be one of the best suited to take advantage of the growing trend of companies and insurers using fitness tracking to try to decrease employee health insurance costs.
Annaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY) just barely makes the cut-off for this list, after a small decline since August has dropped the stock to around $10. Annaly deals mostly in mortgage-backed securities or other real estate-related investment securities, but it has the ability to venture into new kinds of investments, which has helped to diversify its portfolio, and now has around $8 billion in holdings. Though the stock price has been pressured recently, Annaly is one of the biggest in its field, and its 20-year history means it's probably adequately prepared to weather current global macro conditions.   
What makes this stock especially attractive is its incredible dividend yield at over 10%. Though the most recent quarterly dividend of $0.26 is a slight drop from $0.30 over the past three years, that seems to be partially because Annaly is in the process of acquiring another company, so there doesn't seem to be much concern that the dividend will continue to be cut. 
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the key competitors in the circuit board and microchip market that's powering some of the most exciting industries such as autonomous cars, artificial intelligence, and more. Though much smaller than some of its big-name rivals in this space, AMD is still likely to gain from a vastly expanding industry. 
Shares of AMD rose nearly 10% in the last week, after the company announced a deal with Alphabet's Google, which plans to add AMD's Radeon-based FirePro server GPUs to its cloud platform in 2017, a major win for the company since it helps it to compete with bigger rivals already partnered with other big names in the cloud computing space. 
Like many energy companies, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) shares have been hammered in the past two years, as low oil prices and other macro or geopolitical forces have hurt the business. Chesapeake's shares had fallen from around $28 in 2013 to just $1.59 per share in February of this year. The stock has ticked up since then, which could be the start of stabilization in the industry and a rebound for those companies best positioned in it. Chesapeake and the entire energy industry could go through an interesting transition as Donald Trump takes office in January, following campaign promises to ""unleash America's $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves.""

Chesapeake explores for and develops sources of natural gas and oil and also provides midstream services for other producers. In its most recent quarter, revenue was down 33% year over year, but its earnings per share of $0.09 beat expectations of a $0.03 loss. At an investor day in October, Chesapeake management revised its production guidance upward 5% to 15% annually through 2020. Note, however, that the company remains highly leveraged and that could drag on future growth.  
WisdomTree (NASDAQ:WETF) is an ETF provider that, since its inception in 2006, has grown to sponsor 94 distinct ETFs that span asset classes and countries around the world. Over the past year, certain negative market trends, particularly in Japan and Europe, have hurt the company's earnings and stock price.
However, things look good for WidsomTree going forward, including new products being launched such as ""smart beta fixed income,"" as well as ETFs focused on new geographies. While the company weathers current market trends, the stock could be cheap for a well-performing company. Most recently, WisdomTree acquired a 36% equity interest in AdvisorEngine (formerly known as Vanare), which is a digital wealth management platform that enables individual customization of portfolios.
What do all of these stocks have in common? They've all been generally unloved by the market, and their stock prices have consequently been pushed into this low price range. For that, there could be some value left in them for unexpected growth -- but be careful, as these will certainly be riskier than other options.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged for the second day in a row on Thursday following the announcement that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google planned to integrate AMD's server GPUs into its cloud platform. AMD stock was up about 9.5% at 3:30 p.m. EST, adding to a gain of nearly 10% on Wednesday.
Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) already has a presence at most of the major cloud-computing vendors, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and IBM's cloud platform. For AMD, the Google deal marks the second significant cloud win for the company in recent months, following a deal that will put its GPUs into Alibaba's cloud.
The Google deal represents progress for AMD, which has failed to capitalize on the growing trend of GPUs being used in the data center to the same extent as NVIDIA. NVIDIA's data center business is booming, with revenue tripling during the third quarter, to $240 million. AMD doesn't break out its data center GPU sales.
While some optimism is warranted due to this deal, Google is also adding NVIDIA GPUs to its cloud platform. This move fits in with Google's general push to make its cloud platform heterogeneous, not dependent on any single vendor. The company is working on developing a server based on IBM's POWER9 CPU, for example. Supporting both major GPU vendors makes sense given this strategy.
A recent note from analyst Ian Ing estimates that artificial intelligence could be a $15 billion opportunity for chip companies by 2025. NVIDIA is singled out as having an advantage in this area, while AMD is considered ""too resource constrained to fully address the opportunity."" With AMD fighting to win back market share in the GPU and CPU markets on a research and development budget that has been slashed over the past few years, that concern seems valid.
The Google cloud deal is certainly good news for AMD. But a 20% move in two days is hard to justify.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged on Wednesday, with the stock up 11.2% at its peak. News that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google plans to add AMD's Radeon-based FirePro server GPUs to its cloud platform in 2017 seems to be the main driver. The stock had settled a bit by 2:45 p.m. EST, up about 9.25%.
AMD is playing catch-up to rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) when it comes to cloud computing. NVIDIA has been focused on getting its Telsa GPUs into cloud data centers for years, and the company recently announced a blowout third quarter featuring a tripling of its data-center revenue. NVIDIA's GPUs are already available for users of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and IBM's cloud platform.
Beginning in 2017, AMD's FirePro S9300 x2 server GPUs, the company's most powerful, will be used to accelerate Google Compute Engine and Google Cloud Machine Learning services. Possible use cases include medical and financial simulations, machine learning, and video rendering and transcoding.
""The adoption of AMD GPU technology in Google Cloud Platform is a validation of the progress AMD has made in GPU hardware and our Radeon Open Compute Platform, which is the only fully open source hyperscale GPU compute platform in the world today,"" Said Raja Koduri, SVP and chief architect, Radeon Technologies Group, AMD. ""We expect that our momentum in GPU computing will continue to accelerate with future hardware and software releases and advances in the ecosystem of middleware and libraries.""
It's important to note that Google will also be adding NVIDIA's Tesla P100 and K80 GPUs to its cloud platform next year, so this isn't bad news for NVIDIA. For AMD, it represents tangible progress in the company's effort to become a major player in the accelerator market. NVIDIA's GPUs remain far more prevalent among cloud-computing providers, but this is a step in the right direction for AMD.
Still, a 10% jump in the stock price seems excessive. No details on the quantity of GPUs were given, so it's unclear exactly how big of a deal this is. Given Google's choice to add GPUs from both companies, this is as much a win for NVIDIA as it is for AMD.

Polaris was supposed to be a big deal for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The RX 480, launched in late June, and the RX 470 and RX 460, launched in August, went after the mainstream portion of the graphics card market aggressively. After losing substantial market share to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past few years and watching its graphics and computing segment plunge into the red, AMD bet on Polaris to begin its comeback.
The situation did improve for AMD during the third quarter. The computing and graphics segment, which includes graphics cards as well as PC CPUs, posted year-over-year revenue growth of about 11%, driven by higher GPU sales. The segment was still unprofitable, but less so compared to the prior-year period.
Unfortunately for AMD, this progress has been completely overshadowed by NVIDIA's blowout third quarter. Revenue grew 54% year over year, with gaming revenue surging 63%. Pascal-based graphics cards, including the GTX 1080, GTX 1070, and GTX 1060, led the way to a record quarter for NVIDIA.
It's important to put the numbers in perspective. NVIDIA's gaming segment, which doesn't include GPUs used for professional or data center applications, generated $1.24 billion of revenue during the third quarter. AMD's computing and graphics segment, which includes gaming GPUs, professional GPUs, and PC processors, produced just $472 million of revenue. The change in NVIDIA's gaming revenue compared to the prior-year period -- $483 million -- was greater than the revenue produced by AMD's core business.
Even before NVIDIA reported its results, there were some bad signs for AMD. The company cut prices on its two lower-end Polaris graphics cards following NVIDIA's announcement of the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti in October. Those cards, priced at $109 and $139, went directly after the RX 460 and RX 470 from AMD, effectively ending AMD's time as the leader in the mainstream portion of the market.
Another data point that suggests that Polaris is falling short comes from Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform. According to Steam's survey data, the RX 480 was owned by just 0.28% of Steam users in October, making it less than one-fourth as popular as NVIDIA's GTX 1070, which is substantially more expensive. None of AMD's other Polaris-based graphics cards registered on the survey at all.
Polaris represents just one part of AMD's turnaround strategy. In 2017, the company plans to launch high-end Vega graphics cards aimed at competing with NVIDIA's high-end offerings, as well as new Zen CPUs. Vega is expected to offer gamers an alternative to NVIDIA's high-end Pascal graphics cards, while Zen promises major performance gains that could drive share gains in the PC and server CPU markets.
If Polaris is any indication, though, investors may want to dial back their expectations. AMD's mainstream graphics strategy sounded great on paper, but execution has been disappointing. NVIDIA's gaming business is accelerating, despite the much-hyped launch of Polaris.
One major contributing factor to AMD's troubles is the company's shrinking research and development (R&D) budget. Just $947 million went toward R&D in 2015, down from $1.2 billion in 2013. Slashing R&D spending has helped bring the company closer to profitability, but expecting AMD to be able to close its technological gap with NVIDIA while spending far less on R&D may be unrealistic. For comparison, NVIDIA spent $1.33 billion on R&D in 2015, despite its narrower focus on graphics.
AMD's task only becomes more difficult going forward, with the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti now widely available. If Polaris-based graphics cards could only drive middling growth while facing little direct competition, it's hard to imagine growth accelerating now that NVIDIA has a strong mainstream presence.

            ","Many investors generally see stocks tripling as a long-term goal. But some stocks can also triple within a single year. Let's examine three tech stocks which tripled investors' investments over the past year, and whether or not they still have room to run. 

Image source: Getty Images.
If you had bought shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) when the stock dipped below $2 per share in February, you would have more than tripled your initial investment in just nine months. That's because the chipmaker staged a remarkable turnaround over the past year on the strength of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which was bolstered by robust sales of its semi-custom SoC for PS4s and Xbox Ones. Those sales are expected to keep rising on console upgrades like the PS4 Slim, PS4 Pro, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio.
In the second quarter this year, AMD posted its first quarter of annual revenue growth since 2014. It followed up that 9% growth with 23% growth in the third quarter, and anticipates 6% sales growth for the full year. AMD returned to quarterly GAAP profitability during the second quarter, and non-GAAP profitability during the third quarter.
AMD is also pushing back against Nvidia in the low-end ""VR ready"" GPU market with the Polaris-based RX 480, and plans to target the high-end market with its next-gen Vega GPUs in the near future. Although AMD remains a distant underdog to Intel in the CPU market, it plans to counter the market leader with its upcoming Zen CPUs.
Oclaro (NASDAQ:OCLR) is a manufacturer of optical components, modules, and subsystems for the service provider, enterprise, and data center markets. If you had bought shares of Oclaro last October when it hovered around $2, you would have quadrupled your initial investment. 
Oclaro directly benefits from the rising bandwidth needs of streaming video, cloud computing, application virtualization, and other data-intensive applications. That rising demand boosted its revenue by 55% annually last quarter, compared to 52% growth in the previous quarter and a 2% decline in the prior-year quarter. Most of that growth was fueled by growth in its ""100G and beyond"" portfolio of high-speed solutions, where sales rose roughly 20% annually for the fifth straight quarter.
On the bottom line, Oclaro's non-GAAP net income rose from a net loss of $1.6 million to net income of $20 million between the first quarters of 2015 and 2016. It also reported GAAP net income of $3.4 million during the quarter, versus a loss of $3.5 million a year ago. Analysts expect that growth to continue, with revenue and non-GAAP earnings expect to respectively rise 44% and 206% this year.
Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), commonly referred to as ""China's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR),"" has more than tripled in value since last October. That explosive growth can be attributed to its rapid growth in monthly active users (MAUs), which grew 33% annually to 282 million last quarter, compared to 36% growth in the prior-year quarter. The company -- which is owned by online media giant Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) -- has posted triple and double-digit sales growth in every quarter since its IPO in April 2014, and analysts expect its sales to rise 33% this year, compared to 43% growth in 2015.
Those numbers are enormous when compared to Twitter's anemic 3% year-over-year growth in MAUs and projected sales growth of 15% this year. Weibo is also profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP metrics, while Twitter is only profitable on a non-GAAP basis. Between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016, Weibo's GAAP net income rose from $4.2 million to $25.9 million, while its non-GAAP net income surged from $10.9 million to $35.5 million. Analysts expect its non-GAAP net income to more than double this year.
Weibo's advertising and marketing revenue rose 45% annually last quarter, fueled by ad buys from small and medium sized businesses nearly doubling. It offers display ads, interest-based ad campaigns, event-based ad campaigns, and promoted feeds. Weibo's new live streaming platform, which allows viewers to buy virtual gifts from the company for their favorite broadcasters, is also boosting its revenue growth.
Investors should always remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. However, AMD is still in turnaround mode, while Oclaro and Weibo still seem to be firing on all cylinders. Therefore, I believe that these stocks could still have room to run, despite having more than tripled investors' cash over the past year.

Pop quiz: What do you get when a company's stock rises 228% in a year while it also loses $548 million over this same period?
My answer: A precarious valuation.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been on an incredible tear over the past 12 months:

AMD data by YCharts.
As you'll see below, some of the newfound optimism bolstering AMD stock is deserved. However, the extent of a yearlong rally has also driven AMD shares to heights that the company's underlying business fundamentals seem unlikely to support, and investors eyeing AMD shares today should do so with extreme caution.
Advanced Micro Devices occupies something of a precarious place in the eyes of many longtime semiconductor sector observers. Long the distant second fiddle to Intel in the market for the x86 microprocessors that power the PC industry,  AMD has struggled to maintain consistent profitability since the turn of the millennium, which has had disastrous results for its volatile stock price over the long term.

AMD Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.
In recent years, though, AMD experienced something of an unexpected renaissance. The growth in graphics-intensive computing tasks related to self-driving cars, big-data imaging, virtual reality, and even high-end video games drove a surge in demand for the graphics chips made by AMD and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).
The two GPU specialists differ in one essential characteristic: NVIDIA has traditionally occupied the high-end, high-performance piece of the market, while AMD has offered more affordable, mass-market chipsets. And its status as the everyman's GPU maker has proven to be an especially large benefit to AMD today. For example, it recently introduced the first $200 GPU -- the Radeon RX 480 -- a feat that could help lower the cost a VR-quality computer to around $600. Since the cost of many VR-ready PCs can run well into the thousands of dollars, a compelling mix of price and performance has fueled market-share gains for AMD in the market for PC graphics chips, even as the market for PC GPUs as a whole continues to decline. To counter this success, AMD's rival NVIDIA recently introduced its own $200 graphics chip design, the GeForce GTX 1060, and it's this kind of behavior that may threaten AMD's prospects in PC graphics chips. The broader implication here is that NVIDIA is willing to devalue its traditional high-end chips to defend its market share, and that doesn't bode well for AMD's continued surge in this space.
AMD has also been able to translate its abilities in both CPUs and GPUs to create single systems on a chip (SoCs) that can handle most core computing tasks for video game consoles like the Microsoft Xbox One and Sony PS4. The company indeed deserves credit from investors here: It appears to have established a profitable niche in console SoCs. However, despite AMD's clear opportunities and recent successes, shares have ventured into the realm of the overvalued.
AMD's business has indeed improved, but its soaring stock price seems difficult to justify, even looking to the medium term. For context, AMD's current lack of profits this year and its expectation for continued losses next year give it negative current and forward price-to-earnings ratios. Looking further to other commonly used valuation metrics, AMD's enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is also quite high at 236.
The common thread should jump out here. AMD's expected lack of profitability this year and next year doesn't inspire a lot of faith that the company can sustain a $6.8 billion market capitalization. To be sure, a large portion of AMD's current-year losses stem from the $340 million charge related to its amended chip-fabrication deal with its former manufacturing arm GlobalFoundries. However, this one-time charge doesn't affect AMD's profit outlook for next year. Thus, its continued estimated losses make me question whether investors are willing to wait until 2018 for profits to appear.
To be sure, AMD has done a great job tapping into the newfound demand for gaming-quality graphics chips. However, NVIDIA's ability to move down-market in that area adds a clear element of risk to AMD's ability to continue to steal market share. What's more, as console gaming platforms seem likely to vie with PCs as virtual reality gaming platforms, it seems possible that AMD's two core revenue growth catalysts could find themselves in direct competition in the years to come.
The overall point is that AMD's stock rebound has certainly been justified -- to a degree. However, given the company's plausible lack of near-term profits and its positive but evolving competitive position, a continued rise in AMD stock seems unlikely in my estimation.

Shares of graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) surged on Friday following the release of its third-quarter report, which blew past expectations. Both revenue and earnings came in well ahead of estimates, driven by the strength of its Pascal graphics cards, and the company's guidance was far better than expected. At 10:45 a.m. EST, the stock was up about 24%.
NVIDIA reported third-quarter revenue of $2 billion, up 54% year over year and a whopping $310 million higher than the average analyst estimate. The main driver was NVIDIA's gaming products, which generated $1.24 billion of revenue, up 63% year over year. NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards have been a major success, aided by a lack of competition at the high end of the market from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
NVIDIA's other segments produced growth as well. Professional product revenue grew 9% to $207 million, data center revenue grew 193% to $240 million, and automotive revenue grew 61% to $127 million. Gaming still accounts for the bulk of NVIDIA's sales, but the company is rapidly diversifying beyond that market.
Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.94, up 104% year over year and $0.37 higher than analyst expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin improved by 270 basis points year over year to 59.2%, while non-GAAP operating margin jumped to 35.3%, up from 23.6% during the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased by just 11% year over year, facilitating the massive earnings increase.
NVIDIA's fourth-quarter guidance didn't disappoint. The company expects to produce revenue of $2.1 billion, plus or minus 2%, with a non-GAAP gross margin of 59.2%. Analysts were expecting revenue guidance of just $1.69 billion. The company also announced that it plans to return a total of $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends in fiscal 2017, and $1.25 billion in fiscal 2018.
Despite AMD launching its anticipated Polaris graphics cards at the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA's gaming business is only getting stronger. The GTX 1060 launched in July, followed by the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti in October. Both challenge AMD in the mainstream portion of the market, and by all indications they have been successful for NVIDIA.
The data center segment nearly tripled its revenue, astonishing performance that suggests that NVIDIA's intense focus on deep learning is paying off. The auto segment also posted impressive results, with the business buoyed by recent news that Tesla had adopted NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 platform for all of its cars going forward.
NVIDIA's results continue to impress, and the company showed no signs of slowing down during the third quarter. A couple of post-earnings analyst upgrades have pushed price targets for the stock up to $95, and investors are doing their part driving the stock price higher.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a non-GAAP profit during its latest quarter, a vast improvement over recent quarters. But on a GAAP basis, the company posted a massive $406 million net loss. The discrepancy was mostly due to a $340 million charge that AMD took related to its wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries. The GAAP numbers include this charge; the non-GAAP numbers don't.
Companies report non-GAAP figures in an effort to give investors a number that better reflects their true performance. Unfortunately, many companies back out recurring costs like stock-based compensation, a practice which I strongly disagree with. Backing out one-time costs, like the wafer supply agreement charge, is often a reasonable thing to do. But when a pattern of ""one-time"" costs begins to emerge, investors should think twice about accepting those non-GAAP numbers.
That $340 million wafer supply agreement charge was the biggest one-time cost that AMD has reported in the past few years, but it certainly wasn't the only one. Between the beginning of 2014 and the third quarter of this year, AMD has taken 15 different one-time charges, with a whopping total of nearly $1.1 billion.

All of these charges, with the exception of the inventory writedown in 2015, were backed out by AMD when calculating non-GAAP earnings. Many companies take restructuring charges, but when restructuring becomes a recurring theme, I don't think it's reasonable to ignore those costs any longer.
Even that big wafer supply agreement charge isn't truly a one-time cost. AMD took a massive $703 million charge related to that agreement back in 2012. One reason for the charge: ""GLOBALFOUNDRIES waived the exclusivity arrangement for AMD to manufacture certain 28nm APU products at GLOBALFOUNDRIES for a specified period.""
What was the reason for the $340 million charge during the third-quarter of this year? The new agreement ""Provides AMD with the flexibility to manufacture certain products with another wafer foundry."" That sounds awfully familiar.
Many companies take all sorts of charges and back them out of their non-GAAP figures. AMD is certainly not unique in that sense. But when these charges seem to repeat themselves, it becomes difficult to argue that they're truly ""one-time.""
None of this says anything about AMD's ongoing turnaround efforts. The company has made clear progress, with both of its segments growing sales during the third quarter. Its Polaris graphics cards have put the company in a far better position than it was in last year, although NVIDIA remains dominant with its Pascal graphics cards. The semi-custom business got a boost with new, high-end game consoles that launched this year. And Zen is coming in 2017.
But as we go forward, remember that AMD has a long history of one-time charges. Its non-GAAP numbers must be taken without a grain of salt.

            ","With the market hovering near all-time highs, it might seem tough to find stocks with significant upside potential from current levels. But for investors willing to take a risk on more beaten-down or volatile plays, these three picks might double within the next few years -- Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).

Image source: Getty Images.
Twilio's cloud platform links popular apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Uber, and Airbnb to users' phone numbers. Its service lets users add contacts, send text messages, or call each other via their phone numbers within an app. That feature is tough for a developer to create and scale up on its own, so it's generally more convenient, economical, and reliable to subscribe to Twilio's platform.
Growing demand for Twilio's services boosted its revenue by 62% annually to $71.5 million last quarter, and its active customer accounts grew 45%. Twilio expects its revenue to rise 61%-62% for the full year, compared to 88% growth in 2015. Twilio still isn't profitable, but its non-GAAP net losses narrowed last quarter.
Twilio's core business looks promising, but it's been on a roller-coaster ride since its IPO in late June. It initially surged from its IPO price of $15 to nearly $70 by late September, inflating its price-to-sales ratio into the high 20s. Twilio then announced a secondary offering in early October, triggering a massive sell-off that knocked the stock back to the low $30s. But now that Twilio's P/S ratio has cooled off to 12, and short interest has surged to 50% as of Oct. 25, I believe that the stock is poised for a rebound.
Cybersecurity company CyberArk is the market leader in the PAM (privileged account management) market. Its platform protects companies from internal threats, like disgruntled employees, by locking down compromised computers before they impact the rest of the network. 

Image source: Getty Images.
CyberArk doesn't face much competition in this market because most cybersecurity companies focus on external threats with next-gen firewalls and threat detection systems. Yet a report from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Security last September found that 43% of data breaches were actually caused internally. 
As a result, rising demand for CyberArk's services boosted its revenue 37% annually to $55 million last quarter. CyberArk expects its revenue to rise 33%-34% for the full year, compared to 56% growth in 2015. Unlike many other cybersecurity firms, CyberArk is profitable on a GAAP basis. Its GAAP net income rose 4% to $7.1 million last quarter, while its non-GAAP net income improved 28% to $11.8 million.
Despite those strong numbers, CyberArk stock has stayed almost flat over the past 12 months due to concerns about its slowing sales growth, weak enterprise spending, and its high valuations (8.5 times sales and 62 times earnings). However, the rising number of data breaches worldwide could continue boosting CyberArk's top and bottom line growth for years to come. With an enterprise value of just $1.2 billion, CyberArk could also be a lucrative takeover target for larger cybersecurity, networking, or IT companies.
It might seem greedy to believe that chipmaker AMD, which already rallied 200% over the past 12 months, could still double from its current price. However, the stock remains fairly cheap with a P/S ratio of 1.4, which is much lower than Intel's ratio of 2.7 and Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) ratio of 6.7.
AMD stock has been rising on the growth of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which is mainly supported by its sales of custom SoCs for the PS4 and Xbox One. New versions of these consoles -- like the PS4 Pro, PS4 Slim, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio -- will require even more AMD chips. AMD has also been pushing hard against Nvidia in the ""VR ready"" GPU market with low-cost GPUs like the RX 480. Looking ahead, AMD's next-gen Vega GPUs and Zen CPUs could help it narrow its performance gaps with Nvidia's high-end GPUs and Intel's high-end CPUs.
Back in July, AMD posted 9% annual sales growth for its second quarter, marking its first year-over-year sales growth in two years. It followed that up with 23% sales growth in the third quarter, and is on track to grow its annual sales by 6% for 2016 -- compared to a 28% decline in 2015. AMD remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis, but it squeezed out a non-GAAP profit of $27 million last quarter. If that bottom line improvement continues, AMD's price might head back to the double-digits within the next few years.
Twilio, CyberArk, and AMD all have upside potential, but they are also fairly risky plays which shouldn't be considered core investments. I personally own both Twilio and CyberArk, but only as minor positions designated as ""higher risk, higher reward"" plays. These stocks could certainly double over the long term, but I also wouldn't be surprised if they were cut in half during a market downturn.

During the third quarter, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported strong sales of its new Polaris graphics cards. The company's computing and graphics segment, which includes GPUs as well as CPUs, grew revenue by 11% year over year, with the launch of Polaris more than offsetting weak demand for desktop processors. The segment still posted a loss, but a far smaller one compared to the same period last year.
Market leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be reporting its third-quarter results on Nov. 10. The company's guidance calls for substantial revenue growth, no doubt driven by strong sales of its Pascal GPUs. With both AMD's Polaris and NVIDIA's Pascal driving growth, it can be difficult to parse whether AMD is gaining any ground on its rival. One piece of data suggests that NVIDIA's dominant position remains intact.
Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform operated by Valve, collects data on the hardware configurations of its users and provides monthly updates as part of its hardware and software survey. I've written before about NVIDIA's dominance on Steam. The GTX 970, launched in 2014, remains the most widely used graphics card on the platform, with the GTX 960 and GTX 750 Ti rounding out the top three. AMD fails to crack the top 15.
The data from Steam aren't perfect. Participation in the survey is optional, and it's unclear whether that creates any sort of bias. The data don't tell us much about the PC market as a whole. But I think it's reasonably representative of the PC gaming market, thus giving us a window into trends occurring in the industry.
The only Polaris graphics card that shows up on the list is the RX 480, the highest-end card that AMD has launched so far. The RX 470 and RX 460 have yet to show up on the list, but they were launched more than a month later.
In October, the RX 480 accounted for 0.28% of graphics cards in use on the Steam platform, according to the survey data. The card faced availability issues early on, which may have depressed the numbers a bit. But NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards were also in short supply upon launch.
NVIDIA launched its GTX 1080 and GTX 1070, both far more expensive than the RX 480, about a month earlier than AMD's debut Polaris card. The GTX 1060 came in late July, a few weeks after the RX 480 became available. All three cards have easily surpassed the RX 480 on Steam.

Data source: Steam hardware and software survey.
The conclusion I draw from these data is that Polaris has not been a runaway success for AMD. These new cards are driving year-over-year growth, but it's important to remember that AMD's graphics market share was near its lowest point during the third quarter of 2015. It would have been shocking if Polaris wasn't producing significant year-over-year revenue growth, given the comparison.
There's no question that AMD's lineup of graphics cards is more competitive today than it was a year ago. But, at least on Steam, NVIDIA's grip on the market doesn't seem to be loosening. AMD will launch higher-end Vega graphics cards next year, and that may help the company win back share at the high end. But for now, NVIDIA remains king.

With their stocks soaring in the last year, it's been an incredible time to be a shareholder of semiconductor stocks NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).

AMD data by YCharts.
To see which stock looks like the better buy going forward, though, let's examine AMD's and NVIDIA's stock histories, the financial trends underpinning their recent rises, and the long-term outlook for their respective businesses to see which stock remains the better buy today.
WIth the stock tripling in the past 12 months alone, investors clearly see a major opportunity ahead for AMD. As longtime second fiddles to rival Intel in the PC CPU market, AMD and NVIDIA have benefited mightily from a resurgence of interest in graphics-intensive computing in a number of markets. Specifically, AMD's move deeper into semi-custom graphics chips that ship into video game consoles has proven to be a boon for the company of late. Case in point: Revenue from its semi-custom chip segment increased about 5% in AMD's most recent quarter. However, I'm not so sure the rally in AMD stock can sustain itself.
Looking to the bigger picture, several red flags emerge in AMD's business model that could conceivably reverse the recent GPU market share gains it has achieved. For starters, there is increasing competition in graphics chips, since NVIDIA -- traditionally the high-end vendor in the GPU market -- recently launched its GeForce GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti chips. These chips target the lower-cost segment of the market where AMD has recently been able to eke out some market share gain. The company's balance sheet isn't particularly impressive, either. AMD carries about $3.3 billion in total assets, compared to $2 billion in long-term debt. This isn't an acute issue, but interest payments on its debts do create one more headwind for a company still struggling to switch to profitability -- which is by no means the case for NVIDIA .

Image source: NVIDIA.
NVIDIA shares many of the same opportunities as AMD, but the company's long-held status as the premier graphics processing chipmaker has allowed it to branch this specialization into a number of emerging growth areas -- and to do so better than its rival.
The rise of competitive gaming is one area that few -- myself included -- expected to grow into a major business, but NVIDIA's wares have become the leading chip for the professional gaming industry, which favors the computing power of PCs over consoles. Self-driving cars also serve as another emerging source of significant opportunity for NVIDIA, since they use many external sensors to gauge their surroundings and behave accordingly. Strange as it may sound, discerning in real time whether the object next to it is a person riding a bike or a car requires a tremendous amount of graphics processing power, for which NVIDIA has also created a series of turnkey solutions. NVIDIA enjoys a similar opportunity in big data and AI visualization, but by now, hopefully you see a trend. The general direction of computing and technology is toward more graphics-intensive activities, and NVIDIA stands to be the beneficiary of this movement, perhaps more than any other company.
Equally compelling is the fact that NVIDIA is also profitable and enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its 47 times P/E ratio makes the company about twice as expensive as the broader market. However, given the generational nature of some of NVIDIA's opportunities, the company could easily outgrow that valuation for investors willing to hold its stock over the long term.
Hopefully, the likely winner in this scenario is abundantly clear. NVIDIA has the better business model, technological leadership, and a stronger balance sheet, and it has already achieved profitability. What's more, NVIDIA's move into some areas that have driven AMD's recent success threatens to derail AMD's growth story before the company can flip to profitability.
Here, the conclusion is obvious. NVIDIA is the better semiconductor stock for investors to buy today.

In an effort to win back lost market share, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) aimed its Polaris graphics architecture at the mainstream portion of the market. The RX 480, priced at $199 or $239 depending on the memory configuration, launched at the end of June. The RX 470, priced at $179, launched in early August, as did two variants of the RX 460, priced at $109 and $139. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) went in the opposite direction with its Pascal GPUs, targeting the high-end first.
This strategy made a lot of sense for AMD, which had seen its unit share of the graphics card market bottom out below 20% last year. The company made some progress on the market share front prior to Polaris' launch, but these new graphics cards will ultimately determine whether AMD will be able to claw its way back to a strong No. 2 position in the industry.
AMD's plan hit a bit of a snag in October. NVIDIA launched the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti on Oct. 25, priced at $109 and $139, respectively. This marked Pascal's maiden voyage into the low-end of the market, providing competition to AMD's cheaper Polaris graphics cards.
In response to the launch, AMD slashed the official prices on the RX 460 and RX 470. The RX 460 now starts at $100, while the RX 470 goes for $170. It will take time for actual prices at retailers to reflect these changes, but it's clear from these price cuts that NVIDIA was more aggressive than AMD was expecting.
According to Tom's Hardware, the GTX 1050 soundly beats the RX 460 in nearly every benchmark, often by a significant margin. To AMD's credit, the performance gap is much smaller in games using either DirectX 12 or Vulkan. But in older games, NVIDIA's card dominates. Given that the GTX 1050 launched at the same price as the RX 460, it makes sense that AMD was quick to lower the price. At the same price, NVIDIA's offering is the clear winner.
The GTX 1050 Ti isn't nearly as disruptive, filling the gap between the GTX 1050 and AMD's RX 470. But the RX 470 has issues of its own. PC World, in its review, called the RX 470 ""a great graphics card with a terrible price."" At a launch price of $179, the gap between the RX 470 and the higher-end RX 480 simply wasn't big enough. The $10 price cut makes the RX 470 a bit more compelling, so we'll have to wait and see if the new price point drives demand.
AMD's reign as the undisputed leader in the mainstream portion of the graphics card market only lasted a few months. NVIDIA's new Pascal cards, particularly the GTX 1050, are sure to make AMD's goal of winning back market share significantly more difficult. This isn't the first time that NVIDIA has forced AMD's hand on prices. Back in late 2014, NVIDIA's launch of the GTX 970 and GTX 980 prompted major price cuts on AMD's flagship graphics cards. That launch marked the beginning of NVIDIA's robust market share gains over the next year.
Beyond the mainstream market, AMD won't be launching higher-end Vega graphics cards until the first half of next year. NVIDIA's high-end Pascal graphics cards face no real competition at the moment, and it could be another six months before AMD finally provides an alternative.
Reactive price cuts, particularly so soon after launch, are never a good sign. NVIDIA is going after the $109 price point aggressively, perhaps more aggressively than AMD was expecting. The takeaway: AMD executing its mainstream strategy and winning back considerable market share from NVIDIA will be easier said than done.

            ","Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) recently revealed the Switch, a hybrid gaming console that seamlessly transforms from a handheld into a home console via a dock and detachable controllers. 
The design aesthetic is similar to the Wii U's, except that the Wii U's handheld mode only works when the touchscreen controller is in range of the base console. The Switch is also similar to Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Shield tablet, which transforms into a home console when connected to a TV and a controller.

Image source: Nintendo.
Therefore, the revelation that the Switch will be powered by Nvidia's Tegra CPUs instead of AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) APUs wasn't all that surprising. But that shift also indicates that AMD's iron grip on the console market might be weakening. 
AMD's APUs (which combine CPUs and GPUs) currently power Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One, and its GPUs powered the Wii and Wii U. If Nintendo's use of Tegra chips indicates a fresh start for Nvidia in the gaming console market, should AMD start worrying?
Nintendo is often considered an underdog in the console market. After all, it's only sold 13.3 million Wii Us worldwide, compared to 22.3 million Xbox Ones and 43.4 million PS4s. The Wii U's smaller audience and weaker hardware specs also caused many publishers to shun the console during cross-platform releases. 
However, many critics overlook the fact that Nintendo's 3DS handheld is actually the best-selling console of the current generation, with 59.3 million units sold worldwide. Sony, by comparison, has only sold 14.3 million PS Vitas. 
With the Wii U, Nintendo was trying to leverage its strong position in handhelds to expand into living rooms. But since the Wii U controller couldn't work as a stand-alone handheld, it was never clear exactly who the console was designed for. The Switch, however, sends a clear message that it's a console that can be played anywhere. 
Nintendo executives likely noticed that Nvidia was using its Shield devices to showcase the power of its Tegra SoCs, which were marginalized in the mainstream mobile market by Qualcomm. Like Nintendo, Nvidia was pursuing a ""gaming anywhere"" strategy.
For example, the Shield tablet plays regular Android games on Google Play and Shield-optimized games through Nvidia's Shield Hub, and streams PC games over home networks. In ""console mode"", the device attaches to a TV and a controller. 
Like the Shield tablet, the Switch's ""brain"" is really just a powerful gaming tablet. Since AMD's tablet-based Micro Series APUs aren't as well-known as Nvidia's Tegra SoCs, it made sense for Nintendo to use Nvidia's chips. Jefferies & Co. analyst Mark Lipacis recently estimated that the Switch could add up to $320 million in annual revenues to Nvidia's top line.

The Shield tablet K1. Image source: Nvidia.
AMD depends heavily on sales of semi-custom APUs for the PS4 and Xbox One to support its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which generated over 60% of its sales last quarter. During that quarter, EESC sales rose 31% annually on robust sales of gaming consoles. 
Sony and Microsoft's upgrades for their consoles -- like the PS4 Slim, PS4 Pro, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio -- are expected to keep the APU orders flowing. Therefore, the impact of Nintendo's decision to use Nvidia's chips might seem minimal. 
However, investors should remember that AMD didn't always dominate the console market -- the original Xbox was powered by an Nvidia GPU, and the PS3 used a proprietary GPU co-developed by Nvidia and Sony. Therefore, if the Switch sparks a new form factor revolution, Sony or Microsoft might consider launching new hybrid devices also powered by Nvidia's Tegra chips.
In addition to moving in on AMD's turf in consoles, Nvidia has been aggressively attacking AMD with budget graphics cards like the 3GB GTX 1060 ($200), the 4GB GTX 1050 Ti ($139), and the 2GB GTX 1050 ($109). Those new cards recently forced AMD to reduce the prices of its 4GB RX 470 to $170, and its RX 460 to $110. 
Whereas AMD could previously generate revenue from niches like gaming console APUs and low-end GPUs, Nvidia seems intent on pushing its only meaningful rival in GPUs out of the market. It's unclear if Nintendo will give Nvidia the momentum it needs to make an impression on Sony and Microsoft again, but AMD investors should pay close attention to the Switch's arrival this holiday season.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) beat analyst estimates on all fronts when it reported its third-quarter results on Oct. 20. The company posted double-digit revenue growth along with a non-GAAP (adjusted) net profit, both signs that AMD's turnaround is making tangible progress.
During AMD's earnings conference call, CEO Lisa Su and CFO Devinder Kumar provided some additional commentary on the company's performance. Here are four key quotes, taken from the transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.
AMD's first Polaris graphics cards launched at the very end of the second quarter, so the company's third-quarter results offer the first indication of how the new products are faring. According to Su, Polaris has been a success so far:
In graphics, we had a very strong quarter, with discrete GPU revenue and unit shipments growing by double-digit percentages sequentially and year-over-year. The launch of our expanded family of Polaris desktop GPUs, and our first full quarter of RX 480 sales drove our highest quarterly channel GPU revenue and ASP since early 2014. Radeon RX GPUs now account for more than 50% of our channel GPU revenue.
It was toward the end of 2014 when AMD's graphics business went off the rails. A lack of competitive products, particularly at the high end of the market, led rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) to scoop up share, relegating AMD to also-ran status. AMD has been clawing back market share for the past few quarters, and it now seems that Polaris will help continue that trend.
AMD's focus on the mainstream graphics market with Polaris has allowed NVIDIA to essentially run away with the high-end portion of the market. For AMD, winning back market share has been the No. 1 priority, and temporarily ceding the high end is likely a sacrifice worth making. Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end graphics architecture, is set to launch sometime next year.
One of the major barriers to profitability for AMD has been its balance sheet, which featured more than $2 billion of debt at the end of the second quarter. This translates into annual interest payments of roughly $160 million.
During the third quarter, AMD took advantage of its soaring stock price to raise cash. As Kumar explained, the result is a less precarious financial situation:
Debt as of the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter, due to our significant debt reduction effort. During the third quarter, we raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock, which includes the exercise of an underwriter's option to purchase 15% or $90 million of additional common stock, and the issuance of $700 million in 2 1/8% convertible notes due in 2026.
AMD expects its annualized interest expense to be reduced by approximately $55 million beginning in the fourth quarter. Higher revenue will ultimately be required to bring AMD back into the black on a GAAP basis, but lower interest payments certainly help the cause.
AMD slashed spending on research and development over the past few years as it grappled with collapsing revenue. In 2015, AMD spent just $947 million on R&D, down from $1.45 billion in 2011. NVIDIA, which focuses solely on graphics products, now outspends AMD in this area.
Su sees this trend potentially reversing going forward:
So I think we have an opportunity to invest a bit more in R&D as our revenue grows, but we're still going to be very prudent with how we do that. I think the key metric there in terms of being net income profitable this quarter, ensuring that we get free cash flow positive from operations for the full year, those are all important metrics for us, and we're going to continue to manage very diligently.
AMD faces a difficult challenge. The company needs to show that it can return to profitability, but it also needs to invest in the future to ensure that it doesn't fall behind. Cutting R&D spending can boost short-term profits, but it can also wreak havoc on the company's long-term competitiveness. Finding the right balance will not be an easy task for management in the coming years.
While AMD's computing and graphics segment still posted an operating loss during the third quarter, the semi-custom segment grew both revenue and profit. Beyond AMD's initial game console wins, the company has announced three additional semi-custom design wins, and some of those wins are now contributing revenue. Unfortunately, Su had nothing new to announce on the semi-custom front:
I will say that we previously announced three, and that's the number that we'll talk about today. Two of them are now known, and they're both in the game console area, one is outside of game console. I will say that we have some very good active discussions on future products and applications, and we'll update more as we get further along.
With two of the new semi-custom design wins being game consoles, the company remains dependent on a market that tends to peak a few years after a new console is launched and then decline until the next generation begins. The semi-custom business will need to be more diversified for it to be a real long-term growth driver for the company.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been engaged in a bitter graphics card battle for years, but NVIDIA just landed a new blow to its rival.
The company debuted two new graphics cards recently -- the GeForce GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti -- based on the company's new Pascal architecture, and they sell for just $109 and $139, respectively.
NVIDIA isn't a stranger to the budget graphics card market, and these two particular cards have been rumored for a few months. But the new cards should worry AMD for two key reasons: The cards offer some of the best performance at the lowest prices, and NVIDIA is marketing them to new gamers, a group it typically doesn't focus on.
NVIDIA made it clear in a blog post that the 1050 and 1050 Ti are great for new gamers, saying, ""If you're a new gamer, these two new GPUs let you be a part of the biggest story in gaming."" NVIDIA usually tops the list for the best high-end graphics cards, but by targeting new gamers, it's also ensuring that it dominates the low-end market as well. 
The company already holds an impressive 70% of the discrete desktop GPU market, but AMD has started to make some gains over the past year.
Data source: Jon Peddie Research.
By releasing the two new graphics cards, NVIDIA updates its budget graphics cards and hopefully spurs new sales in the lower-end market. That's important for NVIDIA because the company's own average selling price (ASP) trend has tilted toward pushing ASPs higher, not lower. That's typically a good thing, but in this case, lower prices mean it can grab more of the budget card market. 
While AMD is making some market share gains on NVIDIA, it's clearly still the underdog. AMD has been able to hold onto customers primarily by offering lower-priced cards than NVIDIA, but this latest move from its rival could end up hurting AMD. 
AnandTech recently wrote that the pricing differences between NVIDIA's new graphics cards and AMD's low-end cards ""[mean] that AMD's two-month run as the sole supplier of current-generation entry-level video cards is about to come to an end.""
NVIDIA's new cards compete directly with AMD's RX 460, which starts at $109 for the 2GB version (the same as NVIDIA's 1050) and $140 for the 4GB version (the same as NVIDIA's 1050 Ti). 
But a separate AnandTech article noted that while the prices are about the same, ""In theory, Nvidia's cards should be a wee bit faster, with the 1050 Ti in particular sporting some great specs for the money.""
We'll still have to wait and see how well the new GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti sell compared to AMD's comparable cards before we know how much of an advantage this could be for NVIDIA. The 1050 Ti will begin selling October 25, and the 1050 will follow on November 8, with NVIDIA saying the cards will be available worldwide on those dates.
What will be interesting to see is if NVIDIA continues to focus on the lower-end market even as it dominates high-end cards. NVIDIA earned about 55% of its total revenue in Q2 2017 from its gaming segment, and grabbing both ends of the graphics card spectrum could help the company keep its gaming revenue up. AMD may have made some recent market share gains against NVIDIA, but these new cards prove that NVIDIA isn't willing to let its rival gain any more ground without a fight.

A plethora of analysts agree that NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) shares are deeply undervalued. Fellow chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also found on many lists of promising low-cost investment ideas.
One of these stocks is not like the other, though. Let me show you what sets NXP apart from AMD, and what kind of investor might prefer each of these chip tickers.

Data from Yahoo! Finance.
To be fair, NXP's recent revenue growth wasn't organic at all. The company merged with fellow embedded chip specialist Freescale Semiconductor in a $12 billion deal that closed last December. That combination should boost NXP's annual sales by approximately 66% by the end of 2016, though some investors might see it as the easy way to increase revenue.
By contrast, AMD pinned its second-quarter sales jump on strong demand for its graphics products and semi-custom processors. That's a clean serving of organic growth, which is a high-quality revenue booster.
But before we jump to conclusions about AMD's sales growth being much more desirable than NXP's version, let me put the two companies into a historical context:

AMD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
AMD's recent sales bump was a welcome respite from many quarters of plunging revenues. The company has been in freefall for years and is a turnaround story that never quite seems to find a happy ending. The current uptick rests chiefly on semi-custom chips that are shipped into the video game console markets. This year's surge is likely to peak in the third quarter, as the console builders put together their product reserves for the holidays.
In short, AMD has no choice but to bet the farm on gaming consoles even though mobile gaming seems constantly poised to destroy the traditional console market. Game publishers and console makers are pulling out all the stops to stem the mobile tide, but how long will that effort last?
And what are the chances that AMD finds a way to exploit the mobile hardware market before it's too late?
It sure hasn't happened yet.
Over on the NXP side, that company is betting big on the exploding market for automotive computing.
The Freescale acquisition put NXP in an unchalleneged leadership position of that fragmented sector, and the future is wrapped in chrome and leather. For now, car-related chips tend to focus on infotainment system, in-car networking, data security, and engine controls. Not that far into the future, the demand for car-specific chips will skyrocket as self-driving cars go mainstream -- and NXP is sitting pretty at this critical juncture.
Long story short, AMD is a risky turnaround bet while NXP is a tantalizingly pure play on one of the largest market trends of this decade.
Both companies have been at the receiving end of buyout rumors in recent months. Let's be generous and assume that both NXP and AMD receive serious offers. Even so, it would make sense to give NXP investors a roomy buyout premium while AMD's buyer should get a risk-related discount.
NXP is a sensible option for many investor temperaments, including value hunters, buyout gamblers, and long-term growth visionaries. Meanwhile, only the gamblers need to worry about AMD's shares. The potential rewards there are more than balanced out by heaps of market and execution risks.

With shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) near their highest level in years, it can be easy to forget that the company is still unprofitable. In 2015, AMD posted a whopping $660 million net loss, its fourth annual net loss in a row. The situation has improved this year, with AMD managing to squeeze out a non-GAAP operating profit during the second quarter. But a return to true profitability remains elusive.
What will it take for AMD to turn a profit? Revenue, and lots of it.
AMD's revenue tumbled 27.5% in 2015, driven by sluggish demand for PCs and share losses to NVIDIA in the GPU market. Through the first six months of 2016, AMD has produced $1.86 billion of revenue, down from $1.97 billion during the same period last year. Cost-cutting has helped keep operating losses in check despite the lower revenue, but increasing sales is the only path to sustainable profitability.
One thing that has acted as a barrier to profitability for AMD is its debt load. During the first six months of 2016, AMD paid $81 million in interest on about $2.2 billion of debt. In 2015, interest payments ate up 4% of revenue, meaning that the company would have needed to deliver an operating margin of 4% just to break even after interest.
The good news for AMD is that its recently announced stock and convertible note sale, which is expected to raise more than $1 billion in total, will allow the company to pay down some of its debt and reduce its annual interest obligations. The surge in the stock price this year created an opening for AMD to raise cash, and the company took full advantage. This alone won't be enough to propel the company back to profitability, but it's a good move nonetheless.
AMD expects to grow total revenue by a low-single-digit percentage this year, but that won't be enough to return the company to profitability. Over the next few years, a few things will need to go right for AMD in order for the company to bring in enough revenue to pull the bottom line back into the black.
First, AMD's semi-custom business will need to secure sufficient revenue beyond gaming consoles. Both the number of consoles sold and the amount of revenue AMD receives per console will decline as this generation matures, creating a hole that the company will need to fill. AMD has already announced three design wins -- one of which is Microsoft's Project Scorpio console -- that are expected to bring in a total of $1.5 billion over the next three to four years. That's a good start, but AMD will need to keep winning deals in order to drive meaningful growth in the long run.
Second, AMD will need to win back graphics market share from NVIDIA. The company has already launched its mainstream Polaris graphics cards, and with NVIDIA mainly focused on the high end, there's a good chance that AMD is picking up mainstream customers. How much additional revenue this will create remains unclear, though. We'll need to wait until AMD reports its third-quarter results later this month to find out.
Third, AMD's upcoming Zen CPUs, set to launch next year for PCs and servers, will need to find a way to claw back market share from Intel. As long as Zen proves competitive, AMD has a decent shot at making progress. Intel has slowed the pace at which it moves to new manufacturing processes, meaning that the manufacturing gap between Intel and AMD will be narrower than it's been in quite some time. As long as Zen doesn't fail to live up to expectations, AMD has a good chance at winning back at least some market share.
If things go right for AMD, the company could conceivably return to profitability next year or in 2018. But an important follow-up question is this: Can AMD produce enough profits to justify its soaring stock price? With a market capitalization of around $5.4 billion, AMD will likely need to sustainably produce a few hundred million dollars of profit annually to keep its stock afloat. AMD has done it before, but the good times have never lasted for more than a few years. Will this time be different? Only time will tell.

            ","The virtual reality market is growing quickly. Right now there are an estimated 43 million active virtual reality (VR) users, but that's supposed to skyrocket to 171 million by 2018, according to Statista. That growth is spurring small and large technology companies alike to focus more of their attention and technology into VR pursuits.

For investors looking to tap into the VR market Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Sony (NYSE:SNE), and InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) should certainly be on your radar. Let's take a look at what each company is doing with VR. 
Advanced Micro Devices made some huge strides in the virtual reality space last year when the company released its Radeon RX 480 graphics card, priced at just $199.
Even at that price, the graphics card can handle the most powerful VR headsets on the market -- the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive -- and gives gamers a cheap way to jump into the best VR experience around.
An ArsTechnica review of the RX 480 said that for $200 the RX 480 is the ""best graphics card you can buy.""  Unfortunately for AMD, the company's bitter rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) released it's own budget card a few months later that Ars said was ""the new best budget graphics card.""  
But that shouldn't scare off investors. AMD's card is still $50 cheaper than NVIDIA's lowest-end GTX 1060 card, and it can hold its own against NVIDIA's card for many VR games, according to ArsTechnica.
Additionally, AMD is making some gains against NVIDIA in the discrete GPU market space. NVIDIA is still the clear leader, but AMD's gains should help the company gain a bigger share of the VR component space.

The other huge upside to AMD is the fact that the company supplies the graphics cards inside of Sony's PlayStation 4. The company has sold more than 53 million units so far and it's one of the best VR-ready consoles on the market. Sony is making big strides in VR (which I'll talk about in a minute) and any increase in sales for PS4, and its recently released variations, could help graphics card sales for AMD as well.  
Sony's stock is currently trading at 15 times its forward earnings, which is cheaper than the tech industry's average P/E ratio of 26. And compared to another major VR company focusing on hardware, Oculus-owner Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Sony is significantly cheaper. Facebook currently has a forward P/E of about 20.
Facebook is playing the long game in VR with the Oculus Rift headset, which is priced at the high end of the market at about $500, after receiving a $100 price cut in March. Meanwhile, Sony's new PlayStation VR headset costs just $399. That gives Sony a price advantage over Facebook and some other VR headset hardware makers, but it also has another advantage. 
Tens of millions of PS4 consoles are already in consumers' homes. That makes the barrier to adopt VR technology much lower than for many PC users (which is what the Oculus Rift requires). Only 1% of computers sold this year will be VR-ready, while Sony already has 40 million console users that could potentially jump into VR right now.
InvenSense's motion sensors have been in the most popular smartphones for years, but the company is looking to the virtual reality market to spur new growth. 
InvenSense released its new ICM-20603 6-axis inertial sensor over the summer, aimed squarely at the augmented and virtual reality markets. The company says the sensor gives VR headsets tighter alignment for head-tracking motions as well as faster refresh rates, both of which are an important part of a good VR experience. 
InvenSense CEO and President, Behrooz Abdi, said on the company's fiscal Q1 2017 earnings call that, ""In the gaming and virtual reality segments, or VR, we have extended our market share with our latest 6-axis motion sensor, and are currently ramping with a game controller at a tier-1 gaming OEM.""
Abdi went on to say that IHS estimates head-mounted displays are expected to grow at a more than 50% compound annual growth rate over the next four years and that InvenSense could benefit from the need for high performance motion tracking.  
Virtual reality is expected to become a $70 billion business by 2020, according to TrendForce. And all of that growth is convincing nearly every major technology company to make at least some sort of move into the space.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has made meaningful progress this year. It launched Polaris, its line of mainstream graphics cards that aim to win back market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Various financial maneuvers, including multiple joint ventures and a stock offering, have strengthened the company's balance sheet. And a return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second quarter signaled that the worst may be over.
The second phase of AMD's comeback will begin next year. Zen, the company's upcoming CPU architecture, will launch early in the year, with PC variants coming first, followed by server variants, and finally APUs. Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end GPU, is expected to begin shipping in the first half of the year, with the goal of challenging NVIDIA in the high-end of the GPU market after years of playing second fiddle.
While AMD's turnaround seems to be picking up steam, both Zen and Vega will need to be successful for the company to reach its full potential.
Expectations are high leading up to Zen's release. AMD has promised significant performance improvements that should at the very least narrow the gap between its own products and those of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). According to AMD, Zen will boost instructions per cycle by 40% compared to the previous generation of CPUs, a major increase enabled by a host of improvements.

Winning back share in the PC market will be the first goal. Zen will focus on the high-end of the market at launch, with AMD aiming to peel away profitable market share from Intel. With the PC market as a whole continuing to slump, going after the high-end gives the company the best chance at returning to profitability.
The server market is equally important for AMD. Intel currently dominates the market for server CPUs, with AMD's market share essentially rounding down to zero. AMD estimates that the total addressable market is around $18 billion, so even clawing back 5% of the market from Intel would significantly boost AMD's top line. Intel won't give up market share without a fight, but AMD's server business can't really get any worse.
Zen doesn't need to be better than Intel's products for AMD to win back some market share, but it does need to close the performance gap. If Zen lives up to the hype, AMD's turnaround will continue to gain momentum. If it doesn't, returning to sustainable profitability will be tough.

Image source: AMD.
While Polaris aims squarely at the mainstream portion of the graphics card market, Vega, which is expected to launch during the first half of 2017, will be AMD's re-entry into the high-end of the market. Ever since NVIDIA launched the GTX 970 and GTX 980 in late 2014, the company has dominated the market for expensive, and highly profitable, graphics cards. Vega will be AMD's attempt to appeal to the high-end gaming PC market.
NVIDIA has a head start, launching the GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 earlier this year. Higher-end variants are expected to be released in the coming months as well, including a rumored GTX 1080 Ti. NVIDIA's next-gen GPU, Volta, is unlikely to be launched earlier than the second half of 2017, but AMD's Vega will be launching into a market dominated by NVIDIA.
Vega will need to be disruptive in order to pry away high-end market share from NVIDIA. If AMD succeeds in producing a viable challenger to NVIDIA's high-end cards, the company's graphics business could become more profitable compared to a scenario where the company only succeeds in winning back mainstream market share.
For AMD, 2016 was important, but 2017 will be a critical year as well. The fate of AMD's nascent turnaround will be determined by the success of Zen and Vega.

Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) watched helplessly as its unit share of the discrete graphics card market was cut in half. Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) scored a coup with its 900 series of graphics cards, particularly the GTX 970, which remains to this day the most widely owned graphics card among Steam users. AMD's market share bottomed out during the second quarter of 2015, at just 18%.
The company has been slowly clawing its way back over the past year, picking up a few points of market share here and there. AMD's comeback accelerated in the second quarter of this year, with the company gaining roughly 7 percentage points of market share compared to the first quarter, and nearly 12 percentage points year over year.

Image source: Jon Peddie Research.
This gain in market share is good news for AMD, but it comes with caveats. The second quarter was seasonally weak, with total discrete graphics card shipments tumbling 20.8% compared to the first quarter, according to Jon Peddie Research. Whether market share gains in a weak quarter will stick around during the third and fourth quarters remains to be seen. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, AMD's market share peaked during the second quarter and declined during the third quarter.
Another issue is the timing of new product launches. NVIDIA's high-end GTX 1080 became available at the end of May, and the GTX 1070 became available in the beginning of June. The GTX 1060 wasn't launched until the end of July, with a $200 variant only becoming available in August. Meanwhile, AMD's $200 RX 480 launched in the last days of the second quarter, with the lower-end RX 470 and 460 launching in August.
The second-quarter data, then, doesn't tell us much about how AMD's new Polaris graphics cards are faring. Despite losing market share, NVIDIA posted solid second-quarter results. The company's gaming segment grew revenue by 18% year over year, driven by the high-end Pascal cards. AMD winning market share during the second quarter may have been driven more by NVIDIA's focus on the high end, leaving the mainstream to AMD, than anything else.
As it stands today, AMD's Polaris graphics cards target the $200-and-below segment, while NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards target the $200-and-above segment. Eventually, NVIDIA will launch lower-end products, and AMD will launch higher-end products, but at the moment, the two companies' newest graphics cards are only directly competing at the $200 price point. This should help AMD win mainstream market share during the third quarter, at the expense of ceding the lucrative high-end portion of the market to NVIDIA.
Rumors point to NVIDIA launching two low-end cards, the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti, as early as next month. Nothing has been confirmed at this point, but the cards are expected to target the $119 and $149 price points, respectively, putting them in direct competition with AMD's RX 460 and RX 470. Depending on how aggressive NVIDIA is with these new cards, AMD's edge in the mainstream portion of the market may not last too much longer.
AMD's market share gains during the second quarter are certainly a positive for the company, but they need to be considered in context. We won't know how Polaris has truly fared until results from the third quarter are released, and the imminent launch of low-end cards from NVIDIA could make it tougher for AMD to hold onto any market share gains in the fourth quarter and beyond. Where the market for discrete graphics cards ultimately settles, whether it's the old 60-40 split in NVIDIA's favor, or something else entirely, is still a big unknown.

Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is popular again -- and it has Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to thank for it.
By now you've all heard about Intel's unexpected increase in its guidance for the current quarter. What you may not have noticed, however, is the effect that this guidance tweak is having on the stock of its fiercest rival, AMD.
So far, since Intel 's new guidance came out, no fewer than three analysts have revised their opinion of AMD stock in just two days. Craig-Hallum upgraded AMD stock to buy yesterday. Shortly after that, Bernstein upgraded AMD shares from underperform to market perform. And just now, says TheFly.com, Susquehanna Securities is jumping on the bandwagon (albeit tentatively), and initiating coverage of AMD stock with a neutral rating.
So what's all the fuss about? Here are three things you need to know.
All of a sudden, semiconductor stocks are looking red hot. Image source: Getty Images.
Let's begin with the what of what's happening, before addressing the why. Yesterday, Craig-Hallum announced its buy rating on AMD stock. This was quickly followed by two somewhat more cautious ratings: from Bernstein, which now rates AMD market perform (i.e., neutral) and estimates the stock's value at $5 per share; and from Susquehanna -- likewise neutral, but with a $6.50 price target.
Currently, AMD stock is selling for just over $6 a share, implying no more than 5% upside from Susquehanna's estimate -- and still significant downside risk from Bernstein.
TheFly.com reports that Craig-Hallum based its upgrade on new ""Q3 guidance on PC strength"" from Intel. Based on this guidance, Craig-Hallum argues there is ""solid demand and a healthy pricing environment in both HDD and NAND,"" and that this will prove a positive for AMD stock.
Intel raised its previous guidance for fiscal third-quarter revenue by 5% last week, to $15.6 billion. The company's new guidance calls for more than a $1 billion increase in sales from Q3 of last year -- 7% year-over-year growth. Additionally, Intel hiked its gross margin expectation by 2%, to 62%, indicating that not only are PC chip sales coming in hotter than expected -- but they're more profitable as well.
This implies there is some measure of pricing power in the sector, which could benefit not just Intel stock, but AMD stock as well.
Perhaps the most curious thing about all of the above, though, is this: Since Intel raised its guidance, investors have increased the amount of money they're willing to pay for a share of Intel stock by only 1.4%, while AMD stock is up twice as much -- 3%.
That's a big disparity, and a strange one: The company that confirmed the good news is getting less of a lift from it than is its rival, which investors are only guessing might benefit from the good news. Does it really make sense, though, for investors to favor AMD stock over Intel?
I'd argue not.
Intel stock costs 18 times today, pays a 2.9% dividend yield, but is pegged for only 10% long-term earnings growth on Wall Street. That already looks kind of expensive, which helps to explain why Intel stock itself didn't get a very big lift from its improved guidance. (Also, as my fellow Fool Anders Bylund pointed out last week, Intel stock had already gained 25% over the past year, so there may not have been much more room to grow.)
AMD, on the other hand, has no profits to speak of. AMD pays no dividend and, judging from the analyst estimates posted on Yahoo! Finance, it's expected by most people on Wall Street to post ever greater losses over the next five years, with no improvement in sight.
So what's the upshot for investors today? Intel's guidance offers some faint hope that analysts' worst fears over AMD may not come to pass. Maybe, if PC chip sales are growing faster than expected, and more profitably, AMD will find a way to lose less money this quarter, and this year, than previously feared. But overall, the big picture remains unchanged:
Until AMD finds a way to actually earn a profit, the stock still isn't worth buying.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is certainly an alluring company right now. Its shares have gained more than 100% year-to-date, with much of the bullish sentiment riding on the growing popularity and opportunity behind virtual reality.
To help put the recent stock run in perspective -- and to point out some potential pitfalls at the company -- let's take a look at three charts that paint a fuller picture of AMD and the state of its business.
Longtime AMD shareholders will know that the company's revenue has been anything but encouraging over the past few years. Since 2014, the top line has declined by about 39% from its high.
Data by YCharts.
The main reason for the decline came from slowing sales of AMD's PC processors, particularly in notebooks. PC chips are among the company's biggest revenue drivers, and a slowdown in the PC market over the past few years has hurt AMD tremendously.
Despite the bad times, the company is starting to see revenue growth return, thanks to increased demand for chips and a new licensing deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology. The latter adds about $52 million to AMD's revenue this year, while the former should help the company's long-term prospects.
AMD certainly isn't out of the woods yet, and investors will need to see the company deliver on promising new chips (like its upcoming Zen processor for servers) and new GPUs to see if the recent rebound is sustainable. 
A couple of years ago, the company highlighted a few key areas that it would pursue in order to turn around its business. One of those areas of focus is what the company calls immersive platforms, which include PC components and the growing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) markets. 
The total addressable market for immersive platforms is $20 billion, according to the company, and much of that will come from the AR and VR segments. 
AMD CTO Mark Papermaster highlighted the company's focus on boosting VR adoption rates in a recent interview with TechRadar, saying:
At AMD, we frankly aim to directly impact that adoption rate. That's why, for instance, we brought that $200 price point for the RX 480. That broke the paradigm -- that is a VR-ready graphics card. You can have a wonderful VR experience, 90 frames per second, very low latency with that graphics card.
The graph below shows exactly why AMD is pinning some of its future revenue prospects on the AR and VR markets -- because they'll be worth potentially $150 billion by 2020.  

Image source: Digi-Capital.
AR and VR certainly aren't the only markets that AMD is focusing on, of course, but with immersive platforms marked as one of the top three focuses for the company over the next few years, it's clear the company is expecting its GPUs to be a major part of its growth story.
It's hard to write an article showing some of the most important AMD charts without including the company's massive bull run this year. The stock has already more than doubled in 2016, with a nearly 220% gain over the past 12 months.  
Data by YCharts.
Management and shareholders hope that the upcoming Zen release could steal some of the $18 billion server market away from rival Intel. The company says it has already secured several design wins with original equipment manufacturers and that it will officially launch the chip in the first half of 2017.
AMD certainly has a lot going for it in the GPU, VR, and PC markets -- management is wisely pursuing new areas of growth and re-entering markets where they believe the company can succeed (like server processors).
But without stable revenue, the incredible share price gains would make me hesitant to invest in the company right now. It definitely appears that there are brighter days ahead for the company, but investors should be careful not to overestimate the success AMD will enjoy based on such early efforts with little to show for them.

With shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soaring this year, driven by hype surrounding its Polaris GPUs and upcoming Zen CPUs, it's not surprising that the company is taking advantage of its elevated stock price. AMD plans to sell approximately $600 million worth of new shares for $7.51 a pop, a price that's about four times higher than where the stock price stood at this time last year. Another $450 million will be raised by selling convertible notes, with the cumulative proceeds going toward paying down AMD's existing debt.

AMD data by YCharts.
Investors aren't thrilled about the dilution that this stock sale will cause, knocking down the stock for two days in a row following the announcement. But for AMD, it's a great move that will shore up its balance sheet ahead of the launch of Zen next year.
AMD expects to sell about 79.9 million shares, assuming an offer price of $7.51 per share. The net proceeds of the deal will be approximately $581.3 million, or as much as $668.6 million if the underwriters exercise their options to buy an additional $90 million worth of stock. AMD's diluted share count stood at 821 million at the end of the second quarter, meaning that this offering will increase the share count by nearly 10%.
AMD is also selling $450 million worth of convertible senior notes due in 2026, with the company expecting net proceeds of $439.1 million, or as much as $505.1 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option. The interest rate and conversion price have yet to be determined according to the SEC filing detailing the offering. These convertible notes will cause additional dilution.
In total, AMD could raise as much as $1.17 billion through these two offerings. The company plans to use this money to pay down existing debt, including $226 million that AMD borrowed under a revolving credit line, and up to $1.02 billion worth of outstanding senior notes due in 2020. Those notes yield 7.75%, giving AMD the opportunity to reduce its annual interest expense.
Until the offerings are complete and more details are known, the exact impact on AMD's interest obligations can't be determined. Over the past 12 months, AMD paid $161 million in interest on about $2.24 billion of debt. That interest represents a barrier to AMD returning to profitability, and reducing it by potentially tens of millions of dollars annually will reduce the time it takes for the company to put an end to its long string of losses.
Because AMD plans to use the proceeds for paying down debt, the company's cash balance shouldn't be affected all that much. However, a deal earlier this year that resulted in AMD selling its assembly and test facilities into a joint venture raised about $320 million, boosting the company's cash balance to a comfortable level. At the end of the second quarter, AMD was sitting on nearly $1 billion of cash thanks to that deal.
For investors, the dilution caused by the stock and convertible offering will reduce per-share earnings in the event that AMD returns to profitability. But the reduction in interest payments will boost profits, so it's not all bad news. Had AMD decided to sell additional shares a year ago, when the stock was in the doldrums, the dilution would have been much worse.
With the first Polaris graphics cards already launched, AMD's third-quarter report should shed some light on how the graphics business has fared. Zen won't arrive in volume until next year, so investors still have a while to wait before it's clear whether AMD's plan to effectively compete with Intel comes to fruition.
By selling stock now, when the hype surrounding these products is at a fever pitch, AMD is maximizing its ability to reduce its debt load. In the long run, despite the dilution, that's a good thing for investors.

The stock market treaded water on Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 both posting minimal losses even as the Nasdaq Composite inched higher to set a new all-time record high. Investors seemed unwilling to take major positions in either direction before knowing how the Federal Reserve and other global central banks are likely to respond to current economic conditions, and that uncertainty offset solid gains in the energy markets that sent crude oil prices up more than $1 to climb above $46 per barrel. Several stocks held the market back from gains, and among the poorest performers were Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM), HD Supply (NASDAQ:HDS), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Whole Foods Market lost 5% in the wake of a warning from competing natural foods specialist Sprouts Farmers Market. Whole Foods' smaller rival updated its guidance, pointing to ongoing deflation and increased pressure on the promotional front in pulling back on its outlook for the rest of the year. With expectations for flat comparable-store sales growth for the third quarter, Sprouts said that it expects earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.86 for the full 2016 year. Whole Foods investors interpreted the poor results of its industry peer as reflective of the environment for natural and organic grocery products as a whole. Given the challenges that Whole Foods has already faced, this new challenge was the last thing that many Whole Foods investors wanted to see hurting the pioneering chain's potential rebound.
HD Supply dropped 12% after announcing second-quarter financial results that fell short of expectations. The distributor of industrial materials said that net income dropped by about 10%, and the company also reined in its guidance for its third-quarter results. HD Supply now believes that it might not be able to grow its revenue for the full year beyond what it brought in last year, and that could bode poorly for a stock that had been hovering near all-time record highs. Investors will want to see signs that HD Supply can continue thriving no matter what the industrial business cycle brings, and for now, they're concerned that the future might not be as bright as the past has been.
Finally, Advanced Micro Devices fell 7%. The tech company said late Tuesday that it would raise capital through offerings of stock and debt, including a $600 million secondary offering of common shares and $450 million in 10-year convertible senior notes. The company expects to use the net proceeds to repay what it owes on its credit facility and to restructure other debt by offering to buy back outstanding senior notes. The stock drop reflects concerns about the potential dilutive effect of issuing equity, but with the shares having jumped to their highest levels since 2012, AMD seems to be taking advantage of investor optimism at a perfect time. In the long run, the move should be healthy for AMD's business, even if shareholders don't reap as much of the reward as they otherwise might have.

            ","This article was updated on Feb. 8, 2017, and originally published on Sept. 7, 2016.
The virtual reality market could grow from nearly nothing in 2015 to $30 billion by 2020, according to tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital. Piper Jaffray claims 500 million VR headsets could be sold by 2025.
Those numbers sound impressive, but it might be tough to figure out which companies will benefit the most from that growth. In this article, I'll discuss three tech companies that could generate fresh revenue streams from VR in the near future.
Facebook's Oculus Rift. Image source: Oculus VR.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which bought Oculus VR for $3 billion in 2014, is the top VR company to watch because it launched the first high-end commercial VR headset with the Oculus Rift and the first VR app ecosystem with Oculus Home.
Research firm SuperData estimated that Facebook sold about 355,000 Rifts last year. Last May, Facebook claimed that there were already 250 apps available in Oculus Home, which also serves Samsung's mobile-based Gear VR headsets. SuperData estimates that Samsung will sell 2.3 million Gear VR units this year, mainly because the $99 mobile-based device costs much less than the $600 Rift.

But Facebook isn't depending on Rift sales for growth. Instead, it's likely selling the devices at near break-even levels to spur sales of digital content through Oculus Home, where it retains a 30% cut of each sale. With Rift and Gear VR owners tethered to that ecosystem, Facebook could generate meaningful app revenue -- something which it couldn't do during the smartphone generation without a dominant mobile OS. Several Oculus Home games can already be played online with other players, which offers us a glimpse into the future of remote visits in VR space.
Oculus Rift and Oculus Home sales won't generate much revenue for Facebook, which generates most of its sales from ads, in the near future. But over the next few years, app revenues could climb, and Facebook could tether its social network into virtual reality, offering users a game-changing way of remotely interacting with their family and friends.
Sony (NYSE:SNE) launched the PlayStation VR, a VR headset for the PS4, last October. The headset costs $400, while a bundle including the PlayStation camera and Move controllers will cost $500. SuperData predicts that Sony sold 2.6 million PSVRs this year.

Since the PS4 only costs $400, the PSVR offers a more affordable high-end VR experience than the Rift or HTC's Vive ($800), which both require high-end PCs that cost at least $600. While the PSVR will work with current PS4s, the upcoming PS4 Neo upgrade could boost the performance of VR games for a smoother experience. It also differentiates the PS4 from Microsoft's Xbox One, which doesn't have a dedicated VR headset yet.
Strengthening the Game & Networks Services (G&NS) unit is a top priority for Sony, since it often posts stronger year-over-year growth than its other units. Sony could also strengthen its Pictures and Music businesses by selling VR/3D versions of its movies or music videos through the PlayStation Store.
AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is the chipmaking underdog that lost market share to Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 chips and Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) high-end GPUs over the past decade. But despite those headwinds, AMD is still well-poised to capitalize on the growth of the VR market.
First, AMD's RX 480 was the first $200 graphics card which could be used for VR gaming. PC builds using that card, including the $600 example I just mentioned, knocked the price of ""VR ready"" PCs under $1,000. Nvidia recently countered the 4GB RX 480 with the 3GB GTX 1060 at $200, but AMD already established a first-mover's advantage in the low-end VR space. Robust sales of the RX cards could continue strengthening its Computing and Graphics segment, which posted 28% annual sales growth last quarter.

Second, AMD's semi-custom APUs power the Xbox One and PS4. That's because APUs pack CPUs and GPUs together in smaller, more power-efficient packages than stand-alone processors. It's a rare strength that Intel and Nvidia -- the respective leaders in high-end CPUs and GPUs -- notably lack.
That strength boosted AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) revenues by 4% annually last quarter, and upcoming upgrades for the Xbox One and PS4 should ensure that growth continues. If hardware makers start manufacturing stand-alone headsets that aren't tethered to mobile devices or PCs, they could follow the footsteps of consoles and use AMD's APUs -- thus widening its moat against Intel and Nvidia.
The VR market is still in the early stages of development, and long-term forecasts might not be that accurate. But if you believe that VR headsets could become the next big computing platform after computers and smartphones, Facebook, Sony, and AMD could all profit from that paradigm shift.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has seen its stock pop 160%  this year, and there's good reason for that. Investors are benefiting from the company's recent release of new graphics processors, anticipation for its Zen PC processor, and the likelihood of its designs winning placement in Microsoft and Sony's next consoles.  
Many investors are also banking on AMD's new graphics cards, like the powerful Radeon RX 480, to propel the company further into the virtual reality hardware space. The RX 480 is an ideal candidate for high-end VR headsets, and it costs just $200.
That low price, mixed with the current growth of VR, could give AMD a strong position in the VR hardware market, which IDC forecasts will have a 183% compound annual growth rate between now and 2020.
But if investors like AMD as a VR play, I think there are two better buys that they should consider: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 
NVIDIA is, of course, AMD's biggest rival. Between them, the companies enjoy a GPU duopoly, with NVIDIA taking about 66% of the discrete GPU market, and AMD picking up the rest. 
And it's NVIDIA's dominance in GPUs that gives it the clear advantage. The company just released three new notebook graphics cards that add VR-ready capability to notebooks  -- not an easy feat. The company says the cards' processing capabilities come within 10% of those of their desktop computer counterparts.
Most VR-capable PCs are already using NVIDIA's processors, but the company is looking to expand that advantage even further. Jason Paul, the general manager of NVIDIA's Shield, gaming and VR business, recently told Barron's that its GPUs are starting to be used in powerful server computers -- and that those could eventually power virtual reality from the cloud.  
That's worth noting, because as VR grows, it'll become harder for PC's graphics cards (particularly the ones made for notebooks) to keep up with its intense processing demands. Cloud servers could be the answer, and NVIDIA is already making huge strides in the space with its DXG-1 supercomputer. 
VR aside, NVIDA's stock has popped nearly 87% this year thanks to the company's ongoing moves into new markets like driverless cars and machine learning. When it comes to an overall GPU play with a VR-focus, there's no company better than NVIDIA right now.  
I'll admit, it's a bit strange comparing AMD to Google. But both are making their own VR plays, and I think Google is the better investment.
According to Bloomberg, the company is about to launch its new Daydream virtual reality platform and content hub. Daydream will bring VR-focused apps, games, and videos all to one location for mobile devices. 
Bloomberg said that it could become the ""dominant way people engage with virtual reality"" just as Android became the dominant way people engage with smartphones.
Already the company is paying up to hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece for some individual pieces of original VR content for Daydream, and is also partnering with HBO, Hulu, Ubisoft, and the MLB and NBA to launch content on the platform. 
The opportunity for Google is that Daydream could become the place to access VR content on mobile devices (or, at least, Android ones). There is no VR content hub like this right now. Instead of having content creators or hardware makers fight over an online content distribution network, it makes much more sense to let Google bring them all together. And it's the main reason why I think Google could be the biggest VR winner this year.
AMD isn't a bad investment by any means, and its new lineup of graphics cards should keep it a formidable opponent to NVIDIA. But if investors are looking for companies that have distinct VR advantages, Google and NVIDIA are their best bets.

            ","Some investors might think that stocks only quadruple over multiple years. However, several stocks delivered ""four-bagger"" returns over the past 12 months. Let's examine three such stocks -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN), and Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) -- and see if they can keep delivering comparable returns in the future.

AMD is an underdog chipmaker which battles Intel in the CPU market and Nvidia in the GPU market. It lost market share in both markets for years, sales fell, and its losses widened as it boosted spending to keep pace. AMD hit a 52-week low of $1.65 on Jan. 20, after it posted a 23% annual decline in revenue during the fourth quarter and offered weak guidance for the first quarter.
But if you had bought AMD that day, you would be sitting on a gain of over 350% today. AMD's sales fell 19% during the first quarter, but it announced strong guidance for the second quarter. During the second quarter, it posted 9% sales growth -- its first annual sales growth in two full years -- on robust demand for its semi-custom SoCs for gaming consoles. It also expects demand for those SoCs to rise as Microsoft and Sony respectively release upgraded versions of the Xbox One and PS4. AMD also returned to non-GAAP operating profitability during the quarter.

AMD now expects its sales to rise 18% for the third quarter, and analysts believe that it could finish the year with 3% growth. Sales of its new Polaris-based GPUs, which have dramatically lowered the price point for VR-ready PCs, could boost its GPU sales, while its upcoming Zen chips might help it regain some market share from Intel. 
Five9 provides cloud software for managing customer relationships at call centers. Its subscription-based VCC (Virtual Contact Center) platform competes directly against Salesforce's Call Center, but Five9 focuses on smaller businesses instead of Salesforce's larger enterprise customers.
Five9 went public in April 2014, and has delivered over 20% annual sales growth in every quarter since its public debut. Its revenue rose 29% last quarter, up from 26% growth in the previous quarter and 23% growth in the year ago quarter. Analysts expect the company to post 22% sales growth this year.
Fire9 also announced an annual dollar-based retention rate of 100% last quarter, up from 94% a year earlier, along with all-time records in enterprise and commercial bookings. Wall Street has already noticed Five9's hot streak -- if you had purchased Five9 at its 52-week low of $3.48 last October, your initial investment would have risen nearly 320%. Five9 is unprofitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP measures, but its losses are narrowing. 
Weibo, the microblogging site often referred to as ""China's Twitter,"" has rallied almost 340% from its 52-week low of $10.90 last October. That massive rally was fueled by Weibo's impressive sales growth -- its revenue rose 36% annually last quarter, compared to 24% growth in the previous quarter and 39% growth a year ago. Weibo attributes that growth to ""the strong adoption of social marketing"" boosting spending among major companies and SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). Analysts expect Weibo's revenue to rise 34% this year.

Weibo's monthly active users (MAUs) rose 33% annually to 282 million during the quarter, with 89% of users accessing the service from mobile devices. Its daily active users (DAUs) rose 36% to 126 million. By comparison, Twitter's MAUs rose just 3% to 313 million last quarter. Weibo's non-GAAP net income surged 225% to $35.5 million last quarter. On the same basis, Twitter's net income rose 92% last quarter. 
However, both Weibo and its parent company Sina face the threat of government censorship and abrupt shutdowns. Chinese censors temporarily shut down Sina before, erased Weibo accounts, and threatened the companies over poor self-censorship practices. Those threats indicate that Weibo's growth could abruptly grind to a halt due to government intervention.
With the market near all-time highs, investors should be mindful of AMD, Five9, and Weibo's valuations. AMD doesn't look expensive at 1.5 times sales, but Five9's P/S of 5.3 and Weibo's P/S of 18.3 look pricey. Therefore, investors should realize that these rallies could fade quickly if their streaks of hot sales growth end.

Both Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) have seen their stock prices skyrocket by about 70% over the past three months. That's great news for the companies' current shareholders, of course, but when it comes to picking the long-term winner between the two, which is your best bet now?
To answer that, let's take a quick look at what each of them has going for it:
AMD is a major player in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, where it completes with the other GPU powerhouse, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While NVIDIA makes the majority of sales in the discrete GPU market, AMD has managed to increase its percentage to about 34%. 
Some of AMD's share price gains came after the recent release of its new Radeon RX 480, RX 470, and RX 460 graphics cards. While NVIDIA has had its share of major product releases this year as well, investors were likely impressed that the company's graphics cards are much cheaper than NVIDIA's.
There are also two new growth areas that AMD is poised to benefit from: PCs and virtual reality (VR). Lots of companies are betting on VR, but AMD's GPUs, like its new RX 480, are capable of handling the data-processing demands of higher-end VR headsets. 
Combined, the markets for virtual reality and augmented reality are expected to hit $70 billion by 2020, and AMD should be able to grow its GPU sales right along with that trend. VR hardware sales (which include graphics cards) are expected to grow by 183% between now and 2020, according to IDC.
Additionally, AMD says it will unveil its new Zen PC processor in the first quarter of 2017. The long-awaited processor should help it expand further into the higher-end PC market (an area it currently lags far behind in). 
If all that weren't enough, AMD's processors for gaming consoles are poised for more growth. Sony is releasing an updated version of its PlayStation 4 soon, called the Neo, and Microsoft is readying a new version of the Xbox One. Both are expected to ship with AMD's technology inside them. Gaming consoles could play an integral role in VR adoption, which leaves even more opportunity for AMD.
Ambarella is best known for its SoC (system on a chip) hardware that powers GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) action cameras. That's been both a blessing and a curse for the company, as its fate is largely tied to how well or poorly GoPro's devices are selling.
Ambarella's recent share price gains have been due in large part to the company's strong fiscal Q1 2017 beat, and to investors' anticipation that there are even brighter days ahead.
That optimism has been fueled by the company notching more design wins across all of its major business segments in the past quarter, according to management's comments on the Q1 earnings call. But it remains to be seen whether Ambarella can live up to investors' positive feelings by delivering solid earnings. Second-quarter revenue estimates are for a range of between $60 million and $66 million, which would represent a 21% to 28% year-over-year decline.
Ambarella also makes image-processing semiconductors for drones, security cameras, and automotive cameras, and is expanding into processors for virtual reality headsets. All of these are very promising markets, but the company's bills are still largely paid from sales of chips to GoPro. 
That could be a temporarily good thing for the company this holiday season, when GoPro's Karma drone and its new HERO5 camera are expected to debut. It's believed that Ambarella's hardware won a spot in the HERO5, and might also be found in the Karma drone as well. 
Longtime Ambarella investors may already be used to the company's chaotic stock price pops and dips, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of them as we edge closer to the holiday season. The current stock price run-up makes the shares tempting, but remember that if the HERO5 and Karma wind up with poor sales (or if Ambarella didn't win a spot for its hardware in the drone), we're likely to see another huge sell-off. Because the company's fate is still so closely tied to GoPro's, I don't think Ambarella is a great long-term bet. 
As for AMD, some of the company's stock price gains are based on speculation about the future prospects of PC processor sales and VR adoption. That's not all bad, because these are two legitimate areas for investors to get excited about. But the company is also grounded in solid GPU sales and is continually gaining more market share in that space. 
AMD's fate isn't as closely tied to another single company as Ambarella's is, and for that reason -- along with its strong GPU position -- it's the better play for long-term investors.

It's been a great year to be an AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholder. The chipmaker's stock has risen nearly 170% year to date, strongly outperforming almost all of its peers and the broader market.
With the year more than halfway over, let's take a quick look back at some of AMD's best moves to date.
In June, AMD unveiled three new graphics processors: the RX 480, RX 470, and RX 460. All three are aimed at buyers on a budget, retailing for between $100 and $200. The flagship RX 480 is particularly notable, as it's able to power high-end virtual reality headsets, including the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.
Almost half of AMD's 2016 rally has come in the wake of these new GPUs. The market for virtual reality headsets is projected to surge in the years ahead. Research firm IDC believes that nearly 65 million VR headsets will ship in 2020, up from fewer than 10 million this year.
AMD remains a secondary player in the market for GPUs, but along with rival NVIDIA, holds a duopoly over the space. Investors appear to like AMD's prospects, as the RX 480 could help it court consumers unwilling to pay for NVIDIA's more expensive silicon.
About 60% of AMD's sales come from its enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment. The bulk of that revenue is directly attributable to AMD's video games business. AMD's chips power all current-generation video game consoles, including the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
In the past, video game console-makers released new systems every five to six years. However, the industry appears to be in the midst of a major shift, with more incremental hardware releases occurring more often. That could benefit AMD's semi-custom business in the years ahead.
Earlier this year, AMD confirmed that it had won the rights to three major new devices. One of those devices is Project Scorpio, an upgraded version of the Xbox One console set to ship in the fall of 2017. Another is likely the PlayStation 4 Neo, an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 confirmed to exist, but not yet detailed. The PlayStation 4 Neo is likely to be formally unveiled next month. It will probably sport an AMD chip.
In addition to GPUs and chips for video game consoles, AMD has a significant CPU business. Unfortunately, its CPUs haven't been particularly competitive in recent years. Rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) dominates the market, particularly at the high end -- if you purchase a PC that retails for more than $600, there's a good chance it will be powered by an Intel chip.
But AMD could reemerge as a viable market participant as early as next year. AMD has been hyping its forthcoming ""Zen"" processor since 2015, but offered more concrete details this year.
""I'm excited to report that, in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next generation Zen-based processor at Computex in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter, and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers' labs,"" said AMD CEO Lisa Su on the company's July earnings call.
Earlier this month, AMD demonstrated its forthcoming Summit Ridge -- a processor aimed at high-performance desktop PCs and slated to arrive in the first quarter next year. Details remain scant, but Summit Ridge appears to offer performance on par with Intel's i7 6900K, one of the company's top desktop processors.
AMD's business improved in 2016. Last quarter, AMD reported adjusted operating income, up from a loss in the same quarter last year. But the gain was slight, and AMD remains unprofitable under generally accepted accounting principles. At the same time, its sales have risen only modestly, up 9% on an annual basis last quarter.
The bulk of AMD's share price appreciation appears to have been driven by investors' hopes for a brighter future. With Zen on the horizon and interest in VR heating up, AMD could see meaningfully improved financials in the years ahead, justifying its stock's rapid rise.

By virtually any measure, 2016 has been fantastic for AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders. Year-to-date, AMD stock has risen nearly 160%, and is currently trading near levels not seen since 2012.
Why has AMD performed so spectacularly? Although a number of factors have gone in AMD's favor this year, much of its rally can be traced to one product: the Radeon RX 480.
The market for dedicated graphics processors is dominated by just two companies: AMD and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Of the two, AMD is the smaller player. Last quarter, around 10 million graphics cards were shipped worldwide, of which about 30% were powered by AMD's chips, according to Jon Peddie Research. The remaining 70% relied on chips from rival NVIDIA.
But that 30% is a notable improvement from last year. In the second quarter of 2015, AMD captured just 18% of the graphics card market. That upswing could continue, led by AMD's new family of processors.
In June, AMD unveiled three graphics processors based on its new Polaris architecture: the Radeon RX 480, RX 470, and RX 460. As the flagship card in AMD's lineup, the RX 480 is the most intriguing. It retails for just $199, but is able to power virtual reality headsets, including the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.
AMD shares have risen nearly 70% since the RX 480 was officially unveiled. It isn't the most powerful graphics card on the market, but it offers an economical way to experience VR.
""The launch of our new Polaris-based RX 480 GPUs at the end of June...helped contribute to our highest desktop channel GPU shipments since the fourth quarter of 2014,"" said AMD CEO Lisa Su on the company's July earnings call.
For investors interested in VR, AMD is one of the few companies offering significant exposure. Anyone pursuing a high-end virtual reality experience must buy a graphics processor. When they do, there's a good chance they'll buy one from AMD -- most likely the RX 480.
Interest in VR has skyrocketed in recent months, and demand for VR headsets is expected to surge in the years ahead. Research firm IDC projects that shipments of VR headsets will approach 65 million by 2020, up from about 9.6 million this year.
AMD's business has shown signs of improvement in 2016, but much of its rally may be predicated on investors projecting future dominance. Last quarter, AMD's revenue rose, but only modestly, inching up just over 9%. At the same time, it turned an operating loss into positive operating income, but only on an adjusted basis -- and even then, it only earned $3 million.
Rival NVIDIA is offering a suite of superior products. Currently, AMD has absolutely nothing in its arsenal that can hold its own with NVIDIA's flagship GTX 1080. Fortunately for AMD, the GTX 1080 is about three-times more expensive. But NVIDIA also offers competing products at commensurate price points, including the recently released GTX 1060 3GB.
But a rising tide could lift all boats. Even if AMD remains a secondary player in the graphics processor market, it could benefit from broadly growing demand, spurned on by widespread VR adoption.
The RX 480 isn't the best graphics card on the market, but it offers solid performance at an attractive price point. For investors, it gives them a reason to believe in AMD's graphics business. It's hard to think of a better, or more important product, AMD has released this year.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have exploded since last summer, driven by rising optimism that a long-awaited turnaround is finally here. The stock is up an astounding 330% since this time last year, giving investors who stuck it out an incredible return.

Data by YCharts.
These gains have been driven not by improving results but the expectation that they will improve in the future. AMD launched a brand new line of graphics cards, Polaris, earlier this year, and it plans to begin shipping in volume its upcoming Zen CPUs in 2017. Both AMD and the market predict that these new products will drive market share gains, from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the graphics card market and from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the PC and server CPU markets.
There's only one risk that really matters at this point for AMD investors, given the circumstances: It's that Polaris and Zen will fail to deliver on their promises.

Over the past few years, AMD went from a strong player in the graphics card market to an also-ran. Its unit market share slumped from around 40% in 2014 to just over 20% today as NVIDIA won customers with its disruptive GTX 900 series.
AMD has been slowly clawing back market share over the past few quarters, but the company needs something big in order to jump back to where it was two years ago. Polaris, a line of graphics cards aimed at the high-volume mainstream portion of the market, has the potential to reverse AMD's fortunes in the graphics card market. But NVIDIA won't give up its own gains without a fight.
The first Polaris card, the RX 480, launched to good reviews with its $199 to $239 price point representing an aggressive play at the mainstream graphics card market. It only took a few weeks for NVIDIA to respond, launching the $249 GTX 1060 in July, with a $199 version launched earlier this month. The cheaper version is aimed directly at the lower-end RX 480, while the more expensive version delivers better performance for a slightly higher price.
AMD has since launched two lower-end Polaris graphics cards, the RX 470 and RX 460, and NVIDIA has yet to respond with low-end cards of its own. But the main takeaway is that AMD's Polaris, while competitive with NVIDIA's new Pascal graphics cards, isn't the kind of disruptive product that makes for guaranteed wins. Getting back to a 40% unit market share is likely going to take a lot longer than the market seems to expect, creating the risk that AMD's results won't be good enough to justify the now higher stock price.

AMD expects to begin shipping its Zen CPUs in volume next year, and it recently released benchmarks suggesting that the eight core PC version of the chip will be able to go toe-to-toe with Intel's best. There are a lot of problems with AMD's numbers, as pointed out by Anandtech, so we'll have to wait for independent third-party tests before having a good sense of where Zen truly stacks up.
Like with Polaris, the big risk for AMD is that Zen fails to win the strong market reception and corresponding demand that investors expect. Zen is supposed to fix the mistakes that AMD made with its current generation of CPUs, which suffer from lackluster single-threaded performance compared to Intel's products. The performance gap between the two companies will certainly narrow, aided by AMD's move to a 14nm manufacturing process -- but it may not be enough.
It's important to remember that AMD is competing with Intel, a company that has far greater resources, a near-monopoly in the server CPU market, and a dominant share of the PC CPU market. Zen being a massive success for AMD is not a foregone conclusion, although the market is pricing the stock as if it is.
With AMD stock more than quadrupling over the past year despite the fact that the company is still posting net losses each and every quarter, there's a chance that expectations have diverged from the results the company is likely to deliver. I could be wrong, of course, and both Polaris and Zen may be so successful for AMD that the current stock price proves to be pessimistic. But betting on a best-case scenario is a risky gambit. Anything short of perfection will lead to trouble for investors.

Overall, it's been a good year for semiconductors. Versus the greater Nasdaq Composite's return of 3.6%, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) has increased nearly 28%. The most interesting story in the semiconductor space is the red-hot graphics processing unit, or GPU, makers, which are outperforming the larger index by a huge margin during this period.

AMD data by YCharts.
As you can see, GPU makers NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) are outperforming the greater index by a factor of 6 and 12, respectively. Additionally, comparisons between these GPU makers and the SOX don't tell the whole story of GPU outperformance, because the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is a modified market-weighted index that includes NVIDIA -- and its 170% one-year return -- among the 30 stocks it tracks.
Even better for investors, there are still favorable tailwinds that could drive NVIDIA and AMD higher.
The incredible success of Pokemon Go points to huge demand for virtual and augmented reality. While it's important to note that the game most likely did nothing in the short term to boost either company's fortunes, the game's success nevertheless portends tremendous demand for virtual and augmented reality. This will only increase as game makers embrace the augmented- and virtual-reality formats.

Currently, the most influential company in the virtual-reality space, Facebook's Oculus, recommends AMD R9 290 and NVIDIA's GTX 970 video cards, or greater, to ensure the full Rift experience on Oculus-ready PCs. As true virtual reality increases in popularity, and the small group of VR innovators currently using VR diffuses into the larger early adopters/opinion leaders and early majority groups (see: Rogers Diffusion of Innovation graph to the left), upgraded GPUs should be positive tailwinds for the entire industry.
Here's the point: AMD and NVIDIA are the entire industry. As Jon Peddie Research notes, in the first quarter of 2016, AMD boasted 22.8% market share, with NVIDIA taking 77.2% of the add-in graphics board market. Presented another way, AMD and NVIDIA have 100% of the add-in graphics board (read: GPU) market in the first quarter. It's unlikely either of these two companies will concede a large amount of market share to another competitor anytime soon.
It's important to note that all investments have risk. One of the key risks to both AMD and NVIDIA is slowing computer shipment figures. In June, IDC announced it expected PC shipments to fall 7.3% this year, 2 percentage points lower than earlier projections. In April, chip giant Intel announced plans to lay off up to 12,000 employees, 11% of its workforce, as the company has struggled in the wake of falling PC sales. On the surface, it would appear the factory-installed GPU market would suffer as shipments continue to fall.
However, a VR/AR increase would help GPUs offset falling PC sales in a few ways. First, VR-inspired computer upgraders will select units with higher-end, more-expensive GPUs to take advantage of VR functionality; the favorable mix should help offset the headwinds of falling factory-installed shipments figures.
Second, increased VR gaming should increase demand for non-PC chips and other VR-supportive technologies. Last quarter, AMD CEO Lisa Su specifically mentioned Microsoft's next-generation gaming console, Project Scorpio, as a design win for AMD's semi-custom chip business. NVIDIA's Iray software allows panoramic snapshots to be turned into immersive, head-mounted display VR experiences, and they should quickly grow alongside VR headsets and content.
Another risk is that both companies are considered ""expensive"" by traditional metrics. NVIDIA trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 41 times, and AMD has struggled with profitability, posting a rare quarter of GAAP profitability in the second quarter with the help of a gain on the sale of equity interests of a joint venture to China in the recently reported second quarter. However, analysts polled by Yahoo! Finance estimate annualized growth of 24% and 49%, respectively, over the next five years. If VR really is ""the next big thing"" in tech, it's likely those figures will be higher.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have been fierce rivals in the CPU market over the past few decades. Back in 2006, AMD conquered nearly half the PC market with its low-cost chips, according to PassMark Software. But over the past decade, AMD's chips fell far behind Intel's in terms of performance and power efficiency. Last quarter, AMD controlled just 18% of the market while Intel controlled 82%.

AMD's big mistake was waging two separate wars -- one in CPUs against Intel, and another in GPUs against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Both rivals had deeper pockets, enabling them to launch CPUs and GPUs which eventually outperformed AMD's. AMD stuck to the low-end CPU and GPU markets, merged CPUs and GPUs together in its APU chipsets, and diversified into embedded chips for gaming consoles, ARM-based processors for data centers, and other markets.
Intel dominated the PC and data center markets, but it gradually ran out of room to grow. Global demand for PCs started falling, due to longer upgrade cycles and the rise of smartphones and tablets. Intel paid billions in subsidies to convince smartphone makers to use its Atom chips, yet it didn't gain any ground against ARM-based leader Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Demand for Intel's data center chips also sputtered due to weaker enterprise spending and aggressive competition from rivals like IBM. Intel has diversified into new markets like the Internet of Things (IoT) and non-volatile memory, but these businesses remain small and competition remains fierce.
The past decade was disastrous for AMD, with its annual revenues dropping from $5.85 billion in 2005 to $3.99 billion in 2015. During that same period, Intel's annual revenue surged 43%. As a result, AMD stock tumbled nearly 70% over the past decade, while Intel stock has more than doubled. 
However, past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. Last quarter, AMD's revenue rose 9% annually to $1.03 billion, beating estimates by about $75 million and representing its first quarter of year-over-year growth in two full years. AMD expects revenue for the current quarter to rise 18% annually, and analysts believe that it can post 3% sales growth this year and 6% sales growth next year. 
Most of that growth will be driven by its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, Semi-Custom) business, which supplies APUs for the PS4 and Xbox One, as well as the GPU for the Wii U. Sony and Microsoft's PS4 Neo, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio hardware upgrades should continue supporting the unit's growth.

Intel's revenue rose just 2% annually to $13.5 billion last quarter, missing estimates by $40 million. Weak PC sales caused its Client Computing revenue to fall 3%, and data center revenue rose just 5% -- much lower than the 15% annual growth rate Intel previously targeted. Intel expects sales for the current quarter to rise another 3%, while analysts see its full-year revenue improving 4% for both fiscal 2016 and 2017. 
AMD posted a GAAP net profit of $69 million last quarter, which was a massive improvement from its loss of $181 million in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes gains from a Chinese joint venture, its net loss narrowed from $131 million to $40 million, or $0.05 per share -- exceeding expectations by three cents. Analysts expect AMD's non-GAAP earnings to rise 61% this year and grow at an average annual rate of 49% over the next five years. 
Intel's GAAP net income fell 51% to $1.3 billion last quarter due to some big acquisition-related charges. On a non-GAAP basis, net income slipped 6% to $2.9 billion, or $0.59 per share, but still beat estimates by six cents. However, much of that beat can be attributed to the $804 million Intel spent on stock buybacks during the quarter and thousands of job cuts. Analysts expect Intel's non-GAAP earnings to improve 7% this year and rise at an average rate of 5% over the next five years.
It's tough to do an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison between Intel and AMD's valuations, since the former has been consistently profitable while the latter has a negative P/E due to quarters of losses. However, AMD now trades at just 1.6 times sales, which is much lower than Intel's P/S ratio of 2.9 and the semiconductor industry average of 2.9.
AMD's better growth numbers and its lower P/S ratio indicate that it's a better buy than Intel at current prices. However, AMD can only keep growing if console sales keep rising, its GPUs can counter Nvidia's aggressively priced Pascal lineup, and the Zen CPUs dent Intel's PC market. If AMD misses those targets, it could quickly give up its gains, so it's still a much more speculative play than Intel -- which remains a decent income-generating stalwart for conservative investors.

            ","2016 has been a great comeback year for AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). The chipmaker posted 9% annual sales growth last quarter, representing its first quarter of growth in two years. It also believes sales will rise 18% for the current quarter, while analysts forecast 3% sales growth for the year. 
That growth was fueled by robust demand for its semi-custom SoCs for gaming consoles, and that momentum should continue as Sony and Microsoft roll out their PS4 Neo, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio updates. The upcoming launch of its Zen CPU for PCs could also finally enable AMD to regain some lost ground against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).

Those positive catalysts all boosted AMD stock over 150% to a multi-year high this year, but investors shouldn't gloss over the company's missteps. Let's take a look back at AMD's biggest mistake this year -- the underwhelming launch of its RX 480 GPU -- and what the chipmaker should learn from that blunder.
To understand why the RX 480 was so disappointing, we should first discuss AMD's ongoing battle against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). After AMD bought GPU maker ATI in 2006, it claimed nearly half of the dedicated GPU market with its Radeon cards. But by the first quarter of 2016, AMD controlled just 23% of the market, according to research firm JPR, while Nvidia held the remaining 77%. 
AMD lost market share because it was fighting two tough wars -- one in x86 CPUs against Intel and another in GPUs against Nvidia. As a result, AMD lacked the R&D resources to keep pace with both rivals in chip architecture and power efficiency. To remain competitive, AMD targeted the low-end market in CPUs and GPUs, promising nearly comparable performance as Intel or Nvidia for a lower price tag. 
In GPUs, AMD boosted clock speeds instead of developing more power-efficient architectures -- which meant that AMD cards generally consumed more power and ran hotter than Nvidia ones. Those weren't attractive qualities for desktop PC gamers. But with the Polaris-based RX 460, 470, and 480 chips, AMD wanted to change that perception with a more efficient 14nm FinNET architecture. It also heavily promoted the 4GB version of the RX 480, which costs $200, as the cheapest GPU for ""VR ready"" PCs. 
The initial reviews for the RX 480 were extremely promising. Extremetech called the card the ""best $200 GPU you can buy today."" But during the RX 480's launch week, early buyers reported that the card was destroying motherboards by drawing too much power from PCIe slots. AMD quickly rectified the issue with an updated driver, but the public's first impression of the RX 480 was already tainted.
Shortly afterwards, Nvidia launched the GTX 1060, a competing ""VR ready"" card with 6GB for RAM, for $250. According to an average of several thousand benchmarks on UserBenchmark, the GTX 1060 is 11% faster than the RX 480, with 15% higher all-around performance. This puts a lot of pressure on AMD, since some gamers are probably willing to pay $50 more for 50% more RAM with 15% higher performance.
But Nvidia didn't stop there. It recently launched a 3GB variant of the GTX 1060 for $200, clearly aimed at knocking out the RX 480 as the ""best $200 GPU"" on the market. There aren't any benchmark comparisons between this new version and the RX 480 yet, but a Nvidia spokesman recently told PC World that the 3GB version of the GTX 1060 would be ""about 10% faster"" than the 8GB version of the RX 480, which costs $240. If that estimate is accurate, AMD could soon lose the low-end ""VR ready"" GPU market to Nvidia.
If Nvidia marginalizes AMD in the low-end GPU market, AMD's Computing and Graphics (CPU and GPU) revenue, which fell 15% annually last quarter, will continue declining. As a result, investors might need to wait until AMD launches its next-gen GPU Vega -- which is expected to arrive next year -- to retaliate against Nvidia. 
AMD's Polaris-based GPUs aren't bad, but they arguably can't compete effectively against Nvidia's Pascal-based GTX cards. Nvidia knows precisely how to strike AMD for maximum damage, and AMD's GPU sales might wither over the next few quarters as budget-minded gamers gravitate toward the GTX 1060.

We Fools believe that the stock market is largely rational and prices stocks appropriately the vast majority of the time, but that doesn't mean that it's always correct. Sometimes the markets may be overly bullish or bearish for any number of reasons, and if you can take an alternative stance and be proven correct, then you can be in a position to make a killing.
With that in mind, three Motley Fool contributors are sharing the one stock that they think the market is pricing incorrectly. Read on to see which stocks they picked and why they believe that the market's assessment is wrong.
Brian Feroldi: Short-sellers, or investors who bet against stocks, have placed a target on the back of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME). Currently more than 31% of the company's shares have been sold short, which indicates that many believe that this company's future is looking bleak.
At first glance it's easy to understand why so many have adopted that viewpoint. With the rise of smartphones and digital games, it's not hard to predict that the company's core business is going to be under a lot of pressure into the future.
Image source: GameStop.
I thought so, too, but once I started to look under the hood I realized there are plenty of reasons to believe that the market is wrong.
First, let's get the bad news out of the way. Yes, the company's physical game business is expected to continue to decline from here, but at a far slower rate than you might otherwise believe. Management is only forecasting a 6% annualized decline over the next few years. 
Before you smirk at that claim, it's worth pointing out that cutting-edge video games require a huge amount of storage capacity. The average PS4 or Xbox One video game takes up 40 gigabytes of storage space, which is a big reason why digital penetration in video games is only about 20% (versus 50% for music).  In addition, physical games can be resold in GameStop's stores, allowing the customer to recoup some cash. You can't do that with digital downloads, so those two factors should help to slow the overall decline.
But GameStop isn't simply sitting still, as it has numerous growth opportunities in place that will help to offset that decline. For one, the company is using the shift to digital games as a catalyst for growth. GameStop currently rings up more than $1 billion in sales for digital games, up a huge 263% from 2010. 
GameStop is also pushing into the collectible space by offering game-related apparel, gadgets, toys, and more at its stores. Sales are expected to be $500 million in 2015, and the company has aspirations to reach $1 billion in sales by 2020.
There's also the company's Spring Mobile and Simply Mac concepts, which sell products from AT&T and Apple. Sales from these stores are fast approaching a billion dollars, with more to come in the years ahead.
Add it all up, and management is projecting operating earnings growth of 3% to 5% annually from here. The numbers look even better on the bottom line when you consider the effects of share repurchases, as recent history has shown that the company has had success at taking down its share count.

Believe it or not, even analysts agree that this strategy is going to work. The company is projected to grow its EPS by more than 8% over the next five years. With shares trading for only 8 times trailing earnings and offering up a dividend yield of 4.7%, I can't help but think the shorts have bet against the wrong company.



Tim Green: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have surged a mesmerizing 320% over the past year, providing those betting on a turnaround with an incredible gain. The company has already launched the first of its Polaris graphics cards, meant to win back market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and it plans to release its upcoming Zen CPUs next year. Following years of share losses to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in both the PC CPU and server CPU markets, investors are banking on Zen to right the ship.
The first tangible signs of a turnaround surfaced when AMD reported its second-quarter results. The company managed to grow revenue year over year, and while AMD still posted a significant net loss, margins improved. The bull case that has been driving the stock higher over the past year is simple: Polaris and Zen will allow AMD to win back market share from NVIDIA and Intel, heralding in a new era of growth and profitability for the company.
The bear case is also simple, especially following the stock's massive gains over the past year: Both Polaris and Zen will face plenty of competition, and significant market share gains are far from guaranteed. NVIDIA has already launched the GTX 1060, a mainstream competitor to AMD's RX 480, and competitive lower-end cards from NVIDIA are likely later this year. And Intel, which has a near monopoly in the server CPU market, outspends AMD on R&D by a factor of 13. It's certainly not impossible for AMD to stage a triumphant comeback, but I think the market is getting way ahead of itself.
John Rosevear: Here are two charts for your consideration. The first shows General Motors' (NYSE:GM) operating profit margin, excluding special items, in every quarter since the beginning of 2014. (Yes, General Motors. Bear with me here, it's a good story.)

Second, here's how GM's stock price has performed over the same period.

GM data by YCharts.
Interesting, no?
Full disclosure: I did cheat somewhat by choosing a cherry-picked time period. GM's margin in the first half of 2014 were clobbered by the costs of its ignition-switch recall mess, so the slope of the increase looks particularly dramatic. But I only cheated a little: The trend overall has been upward since GM's first post-IPO quarter in 2012, when its margin was around 5.8%.
In fact, last quarter's 9.3% margin was a record. It's not a fluke, either: CEO Mary Barra is driving a series of long-term initiatives (learn more about them here) that are intended to put GM's margin into the 9% to 10% range sustainably by early next decade. There may well turn out to be a sizable increase in revenue (and therefore profits) along the way, too.

It's true that GM was the poster child of the bad old days of Detroit. But that GM is long gone: Over the last few years, GM's quality ratings have skyrocketed, it has emerged as a leader in electric cars and self-driving technology, and it has become much more shareholder-friendly.
What do I mean? Old GM talked about market share and its long-gone glory days as the world's largest-selling automaker, while ignoring the advances made by its rivals. Barra and her team talk about return on invested capital, about returning excess cash to shareholders, about out-disrupting Silicon Valley, and about becoming the world's most profitable automaker.
It's a great story that much of Wall Street seems to be overlooking. The upshot is that right now, GM is dirt cheap: It's trading at just 4 times trailing-12-month earnings, with a dividend yield of almost 4.7%. (Read why that dividend is probably sustainable through a recession.) 
Investors are worried about a near-term slowdown in the U.S. new-car market, but GM's longer-term prospects are very bright. For a patient investor, this one's worth a close look.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 33.5% in July 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Some of the boost came from a solid second-quarter report and all the analyst love that followed. The rest was fueled by buyout speculation and a rosy analysis of AMD's future chip designs.
So what: In the second quarter, AMD's revenue rose 9% year over year. The microchip designer reported a net loss of $0.05 per share, but analysts were expecting about twice as much red ink. Several analyst firms issued bullish reports based on this report, and share prices rose more than 14% the next day.
That gain took place on a Friday, near the end of July. Come Monday, AMD shares raced another 15% higher. One analyst firm speculated that the company could be the target of a buyout attempt. That angle was supported by a successful launch of the new Polaris graphics chip architecture, which looks capable of keeping AMD competitive in this generation of the graphics wars.

Now what: AMD shares have now more than doubled in 2016 and tripled over the last 52 weeks. The company is not easy to pin down with simple price-to-earnings metrics, since the bottom line remains negative. The chip underdog has sported positive free cash flows over the last four quarters, but that $107.5 million windfall works out to an enterprise value-to-cash flow ratio of a sky-high 61. By contrast, archrivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) have EV/FCF ratios of 15.2 and 27.9, respectively.
In other words, AMD's valuation is riding high and the company is under tremendous pressure to deliver strong growth and improving profitability if it wants to defend these share prices. The expensive nature of this stock also makes it a less likely takeover target, assuming that the prospective buyers care about paying a fair price.
This stock has been downright exciting to watch in recent quarters, but I'm not convinced that AMD's rally has staying power. I'd suggest watching this one from the sidelines, at least until AMD can prove that it has a clear path to sustainable profits.

            ","Investors might think that it's tough to find tech stocks that can double within a year. But over the past year, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) all accomplished that feat, and could keep rallying. Let's see how these three companies delivered such big returns in such a short time.
Nvidia stock has soared more than 150% over the past 12 months for three reasons. First, it dominates the PC gaming market with its GeForce cards, and demand within that niche market is rising as more graphically intensive games hit the market. That market is also well insulated from the global slowdown in PC shipments. 

Image source: Nvidia.
Second, its GPUs are being installed in an increasing number of data centers for machine learning purposes, since they can process certain science applications at a faster rate than Intel's industry-standard Xeon processors. Lastly, Nvidia pivoted its Tegra mobile chips toward connected cars, which gave it a firm foothold in infotainment systems and onboard computers for autonomous vehicles. 
These strategies all boosted Nvidia's sales growth from single-digit to double-digit levels over the past few quarters as its non-GAAP gross margins expanded. Looking ahead, analysts expect Nvidia's growth to continue with 12% sales growth and 46% earnings growth this fiscal year. 
Shares of AMD have surged 210% over the past 12 months, which is surprising because its CPU and GPU businesses were marginalized by Intel and Nvidia, respectively. AMD sold cheaper chips than both rivals, but they usually lagged behind both in terms of chip architecture and power efficiency. 
But over the past few years, AMD made a comeback by investing heavily in EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) chips for non-PC platforms. The unit's semi-custom SoCs now power the PS4 and Xbox One, and its GPU powers the Wii U. The unit has also been expanding into data centers with ARM-based 64-bit chips.

Image source: Company websites.
That strategic shift paid off, and AMD posted 9% year-over-year sales growth during the second quarter of this year, marking its first quarter of annual sales growth since the second quarter of 2014. It also expects that growth to continue with 18% sales growth for the current quarter. While AMD still faces tough battles ahead in the GPU and CPU markets, that positive growth was enough to propel the stock to four-year highs.
Silicon Motion is a Taiwanese chipmaker that produces flash controller ICs (integrated circuits) for storage products and RF (radio frequency) ICs for mobile devices. In the storage market, its ICs are installed in solid state drives, flash memory cards, USB drives, embedded multimedia cards, and connected cars. In the mobile market, its ICs are used in smartphones, tablets, and PCs. 
Since Silicon Motion only provides the controller for the flash storage devices, it isn't exposed to the decline in memory prices which has hurt flash storage companies like Micron. Growth across that larger unit has offset declines at its smaller RF business.
Silicon Motion's revenue and non-GAAP earnings grew at their fastest rate in the company's history last quarter. Revenue rose 61% year-over-year, up from 40% growth in the previous quarter and 26% growth a year ago. Non-GAAP net earnings improved 26% sequentially and 69% annually. Analysts expect that impressive growth to continue with 45% sales growth and 55% earnings growth this year. Those explosive figures explain why the stock has rallied 120% over the past 12 months.
But before investors go chasing Nvidia, AMD, and Silicon Motion Technology, they should check their valuations to see if they're overpriced. 
Nvidia currently trades at 50 times earnings, which is notably lower than the average P/E of 75 for the specialized semiconductor industry. Its forward P/E of 36 is also lower than its projected earnings growth rate for the year. This means that if Nvidia beats analysts estimates over the next few quarters, its stock could still be undervalued at today's prices.
AMD isn't profitable, but its P/S ratio of 1.3 still looks low. Nvidia and Intel respectively trade at 1.7 and 2.9 times sales, so AMD could be undervalued if it keeps posting year-over-year sales growth. Silicon Motion trades at 24 times earnings, which is much higher than the industry average of 15 for diversified electronics companies. But its forward P/E of 14 is much lower than its projected earnings growth rate, so Silicon Motion could still have room to run.
Investors shouldn't avoid stocks just because they've doubled or tripled over the past year. But they should do their homework to see if the positive sentiment which fueled those rallies is sustainable, and if their valuations are still supported by their long-term growth potential.

            ","While hundreds of companies will report quarterly results in August, there are two that stand out. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), the leader in the graphics card market, will need to keep up its recent pace of growth in order to justify its increasingly lofty valuation. And brick-and-mortar retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), faced with a tectonic shift toward e-commerce, has its hands full returning to earnings growth while taking on the Amazon.com juggernaut. Here's what investors need to know about these two companies.

Image source: NVIDIA.
NVIDIA has consolidated its lead in the discrete graphics card market over the past two years, claiming a nearly 80% unit market share during the first quarter and leaving Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with the scraps. At the same time, NVIDIA's push into the data center, pitching its GPUs as ideal accelerators for artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks, has created a fast-growing business for the company.
NVIDIA will report its second-quarter results after the market close on Aug. 11. The stock has been on fire over the past year, up about 175%, as investors have increasingly bet that the company's profits will soar in the future. NVIDIA is at the center of a buzzword trifecta -- artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and self-driving cars -- and investors can't get enough of the company's stock.
With NVIDIA stock now trading for more than 50 times last year's earnings, the company will need to impress when it reports its second-quarter results. Sales of its high-end gaming GPUs have been consistently strong, and that's unlikely to change with AMD offering no real alternative at the moment. But further market share gains will be tough, especially with AMD going after the mainstream portion of the market aggressively. And NVIDIA's growth businesses, including data center and automotive, are still small relative to the core PC GPU business.
With the stock priced at an optimistic level, NVIDIA will need to show that it can produce the earnings growth that investors are expecting.

Image source: Wal-Mart.
Retail behemoth Wal-Mart expects its earnings to decline during the second quarter, results for which it will announce on Aug. 18. The company has been making major investments in higher wages for its employees, new training programs, and e-commerce, sacrificing profits in the short-term in an effort to drive growth and customer satisfaction in the long-term. Wal-Mart expects to produce between $0.95 and $1.08 in per-share earnings, compared to $1.08 during the second quarter of last year.
Already, some of these initiatives are bearing fruit. The U.S. business has reported positive comparable sales for seven quarters in a row, and customer service scores are improving. The e-commerce business is growing, albeit slowly, as Wal-Mart expands initiatives like its ShippingPass program and its online grocery pickup service.
Wal-Mart's $3 billion acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet demonstrates how much of a priority online sales have become for the company. Jet launched last year to substantial buzz, promising to undercut Amazon on price by offering discounts based on how many items shoppers buy. With the Jet acquisition, Wal-Mart is following the same strategy that it always has -- offering the lowest prices possible.
Investors shouldn't expect much improvement when it comes to profitability anytime soon, as Wal-Mart doesn't expect meaningful earnings growth to return until fiscal 2019. But the company needs to keep showing progress, particularly positive comparable sales growth in its U.S. business. A surprise drop in sales would likely undo some of the stock's gains this year.

            ","The past decade wasn't kind to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), which ceded the x86 CPU market to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and lost the GPU market to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). AMD's CPUs and GPUs were cheaper, but they always seemed to lag behind Intel and Nvidia in terms of architecture and power efficiency. 

Image source: AMD investor presentation.
Between 2005 and 2015, AMD's annual revenue dropped from $5.85 billion to $3.99 billion. During that same period, Intel's annual revenue rose 43% and Nvidia's revenue more than doubled. AMD lost nearly 70% of its market value over the past decade and went through three CEOs before Lisa Su took over in late 2014. 
But under Su, AMD recently scored a major victory during its second quarter by achieving its first period of annual sales growth since the second quarter of 2014. Sales rose 9% to $1.03 billion during the quarter, beating estimates by about $75 million. AMD expects that growth to continue with about 18% sales growth for the third quarter. That news lifted AMD stock to four-year highs. 
Over the past few years, AMD realized that attacking Intel and Nvidia head-on was futile, since both companies had superior cash flows and higher R&D and marketing budgets. Instead, AMD pivoted toward certain niche markets which its rivals had overlooked. 
In 2013, it scored design wins with Sony and Microsoft to respectively power the PS4 and Xbox One with its semi-custom APUs -- which combine the functions of a CPU and GPU on a single SoC (system on chip). It also supplied the GPU for Nintendo's Wii U, which effectively locked Nvidia out of the eighth generation of gaming consoles. 

All powered by AMD. Image source: Company websites.
Sales of semi-custom SoCs for consoles became a pillar of growth for AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which generated 58% of its sales last quarter. Revenue at the unit rose 5% annually and operating income more than tripled to $84 million. That growth offset an $81 million operating loss at its computing and graphics business. Looking ahead, the EESC business will likely get a boost from new updated consoles like Sony's PS4 Neo and Microsoft's Xbox One S and Scorpio.
AMD also sees niche growth potential in data centers, a market which Intel dominates with its Xeon processors. Instead of competing against Intel with x86 CPUs for high-end servers, AMD has started shipping ARM licensed chips for lower-end servers. To complement that move, AMD formed a joint venture with Chinese firm THATIC earlier this year to develop SoCs for the Chinese server market. It also formed another joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics to expand its ATMP (assembly, test, mark, and pack) capabilities in China.
Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that the fledgling virtual reality market could grow from practically nothing today to $30 billion by 2020. That growth could benefit AMD in two major ways.
When the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were launched earlier this year, consumers had to buy a $1,000 PC to use the headsets. Since the Rift costs $600 and the Vive costs $800, VR remained a hobby for rich tech enthusiasts instead of mainstream consumers. However, AMD recently lowered the price of VR-ready PCs considerably with its $200 RX 480, the cheapest VR-capable card on the market. Current PC builds using the RX 480 have reduced the price of a VR-ready PC to just $600. 
The Rift and Vive currently depend on the PC's GPU power, but companies will likely launch stand-alone headsets which aren't tethered to desktops in the near future. Like gaming consoles, these devices will run better on efficient semi-custom APUs instead of stand-alone CPUs and GPUs. AMD's market-dominating position in semi-custom APUs for consoles gives it a major advantage in this market.
Posting 9% sales growth might not seem like a huge victory, but it's certainly AMD's biggest win of the year so far. However, investors shouldn't ignore three upcoming challenges that could derail AMD's turnaround. 
First, Nvidia's new GTX cards offer a lot of power for just a little more cash. The new GTX 1060, for example, offers better performance than the RX 480 for just $50 more. Second, AMD must prove that its Zen x86 chips, which will arrive at the end of the year, can effectively compete against Intel's upcoming Kaby Lake and stop the bleeding at its CPU business. Lastly, Nintendo has reportedly selected Nvidia's Tegra to power its upcoming NX console, which will likely arrive next March. If the NX is a surprise hit like the original Wii, it could hurt sales of the PS4 and Xbox One and AMD's EESC sales. 
I think AMD's outlook is improving, but I'd be hesitant to call it a ""turnaround"" until it can overcome those challenges. But if AMD's revenues can continue growing year-over-year for the next few quarters, it could be the start of a major comeback for the beaten-down chipmaker.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) returned to revenue growth during the second quarter, showing signs of progress that have been absent for years. The company is still losing money, but new product launches this year and next have the potential to turn around AMD's fortunes. While much can be gleaned from AMD's financial results, management's commentary during the company's conference call provided some invaluable information for investors. Here are four quotes, taken from a transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.
AMD launched its first Polaris graphics card, the RX 480, in late June. With an MSRP of either $199 or $239 depending on the amount of memory, the RX 480 is aimed squarely at the high-volume mainstream portion of the market. So far, AMD CEO Lisa Su is happy with the launch:
We are pleased with the Polaris launch, initial channel sales, and OEM design wins. We expect this strong demand to continue and help drive revenue growth in the third quarter with the launch of the RX 470 and RX 460 desktop GPUs, and Polaris-based notebooks from our OEM customers.
The RX 480 and its lower-end companions will help drive AMD's graphics business during the second half of the year. AMD's unit share of the discrete graphics card market has tumbled over the past two years. During the first quarter of 2016, AMD shipped just 22.8% of discrete graphics cards, according to Jon Peddie Research, down from around 40% during the first quarter of 2014.
Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has lapped up the market share that AMD has lost, launched a mainstream graphics card of its own in July. The GTX 1060 is priced at $249, but according to NVIDIA it offers substantially better performance and efficiency than AMD's RX 480. AMD expects to grow its graphics business during the second half, but it remains to be seen how much market share it will be able to wrestle back from NVIDIA.
The semi-custom business has been a major success for AMD. The company's SoCs (system on a chip) power both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, providing a reliable source of revenue. As game console inventory is built up for the holiday season, Su expects the third quarter to be strongest for the segment:
As in the previous two years, we expect semi-custom shipments to peak for the year in the third quarter, as both Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holidays. Based on strong demand, we believe semi-custom unit shipments and revenue will grow on an annual basis.
In addition to the game console business, AMD will begin to recognize revenue from two additional semi-custom design wins during the second half of the year. AMD expects each deal to generate roughly $500 million of revenue spread across three to four years, enough for the semi-custom segment to grow in 2016. Another semi-custom design win, Microsoft's Project Scorpio console, will begin generating revenue for AMD in 2017.
AMD's upcoming Zen CPUs are expected to improve the company's competitive position relative to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The first PC variants should start shipping toward the end of this year, with significant volume in 2017. The server market may represent an even larger opportunity for AMD, given that Intel currently enjoys a near-monopoly. Su gave a progress update:
We are pleased with the performance we are seeing with Zen hardware, which is helping to expand our customer engagements and accelerating design win momentum across multiple OEMs and ODMs. We remain on track for volume shipments of our Zen server CPU in the first half of 2017.
Intel's corporate strategy now revolves around the cloud and the data center, with PCs remaining an important but shrinking focus. The company's data center segment has been the company's growth engine as the PC market has sputtered, and AMD will undoubtedly face major challenges getting its server chips into cloud data centers currently dominated by Intel.
The good news for AMD is that Intel's pace of moving to smaller process nodes has slowed, with the company abandoning its ""tick-tock"" strategy for an elongated three-step approach. AMD's manufacturing disadvantage will be narrowed with the launch of Zen, and that should help the company make some headway in the server chip market.
Despite the progress AMD has made, the company is still posting significant losses. The company reported a free cash flow loss of $322 million during 2015, a pace that threatened to deplete AMD's cash reserves in just a couple of years.
AMD has taken some steps to shore up its balance sheet, and the result is a larger cushion that gives the company more time to turn itself around. CFO Devinder Kumar explained:
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $957 million at the end of the quarter, up $241 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to net cash proceeds from the ATMP JV transaction, offset by working capital needs in the quarter.
AMD announced a deal to sell its assembly and test facilities to a newly created joint venture last year, which brought in a total of $371 million in cash. Inventory buildup for the second half offset some of these gains, but the net result has been an influx of cash that gives AMD some much needed breathing room. The company is no longer at risk of running low on cash anytime soon.
It now appears that AMD's financial performance has bottomed out. Revenue is growing again, and losses are beginning to shrink. A return to GAAP profitability may still be distant, but the company's balance sheet is in a better position to handle the second phase of AMD's turnaround.

Virtual reality is one of the more exciting trends in technology. The industry remains in its infancy, but several companies are positioning themselves to take advantage of the growing demand for VR headsets and content. Facebook and NVIDIA are popular picks, and for good reason: Both companies could play major roles in the VR economy.
But unfortunately, both stocks are expensive, Facebook perhaps exceptionally so. Investors looking for a bargain might consider AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) or Sony (NYSE:SNE) instead.
If you want to use a high-end virtual reality headset, such as Facebook's Oculus Rift or HTC's Vive, you'll need a PC equipped with a powerful graphics card. Right now, there are only two companies offering such a card, and AMD is one of them. That gives it an opportunity to grow its graphics business substantially in the months and years ahead.
AMD's share of the graphics card market lags behind that of market leader NVIDIA by a sizable percentage. In the first quarter of the year, AMD captured just 22.8% of the market compared to NVIDIA's 77.2%, according to Jon Peddie Research. But AMD has an opportunity to claw back market share by capturing the low-end segment.
AMD's Radeon RX 480 has received fairly strong reviews since it went on sale late last month. The graphics card is capable of powering today's virtual reality headsets, while retailing for just $199. That makes it the most affordable virtual reality-capable graphics card on the market, as NVIDIA's competing GTX 1060 is 25% more expensive.
AMD could also benefit from Sony's forthcoming PlayStation VR. The Japanese gaming giant's VR headset plugs into its PlayStation 4 video game console rather than a PC. Gamers who wish to use Sony's headset won't need to buy powerful graphics cards; instead, they just need consoles. AMD's chips power the PlayStation 4, and increased demand for the console could translate into additional revenue.
From a valuation perspective, AMD is inexpensive. Admittedly, it isn't profitable, and after rallying upwards of 45% in the last four weeks, it isn't as cheap as it was when I recommended it last month. Still, its enterprise value to trailing revenue hovers near 1.7, considerably lower than Facebook's and NVIDIA's. Its trailing price-to-sales ratio, at just 1.4, is similarly modest.
Increased demand for the PlayStation 4 could benefit AMD, but as the maker of the console, Sony could capitalize to an even greater extent. To date, the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 40 million units, and that's helped Sony reward shareholders. Year-to-date, Sony shares have risen more than 23%, outperforming the broader market.
In its fiscal year ended March 31, Sony's video game business generated less than 19% of its revenue, but brought in almost one-third of its operating income. If Sony's guidance proves accurate, it will bring in 45% of its operating income this fiscal year.
PlayStation VR will make its retail debut on Oct. 13. It will work with existing PlayStation 4 consoles, but could also entice some gamers to upgrade. Although Sony has yet to formally unveil it, it has confirmed that it plans to release an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 at some point in the near future. That extra horsepower could dramatically improve the VR experience.
At $399, the PlayStation VR is expensive, but is cheaper than other competing solutions (Facebook's Oculus Rift retails for $599). By itself, the PlayStation 4 is less expensive than a high-powered PC with a capable graphics card, and is easier for the average consumer to setup and use. Moreover, Sony has video game studios and partnerships it can leverage to create quality content for its headset.
Trading with a price-to-earnings ratio near 32, Sony may not look like a bargain, but it's cheaper than other names in the space. And on the basis of other valuation metrics, including enterprise value-to-trailing revenues and price-to-sales, Sony is cheaper than AMD.
Of course, Sony is a complex business with many other segments, but with gaming accounting for an increasing share of Sony's earnings, VR could emerge as a key driver for the stock in the years ahead.

            ","Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) upcoming NX console could be a portable device with detachable controllers, according to Eurogamer. If the report is accurate, the NX's core device would resemble the Wii U GamePad, but function as a stand-alone handheld on the go. However, it will be possible to remove the controllers on the sides from the screen, and plug the base unit into a TV for big-screen gaming.

The NX looks like an extension of the Wii U concept, but addresses the fact that the Wii U GamePad couldn't work as a stand-alone handheld if it wasn't in range of the console. The NX will also reportedly use game cartridges with flash memory instead of optical discs. This makes sense, since loading times are faster and the price of flash memory has declined dramatically, but the 32GB cartridges which Nintendo is recommending could be too small for many modern games.
Those revelations surprised many gamers, who had expected Nintendo to launch a beefier console to challenge Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One. However, the reports about the NX included a pleasant surprise for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) investors -- the device could be powered by its Tegra processors instead of AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD).
Nvidia's Tegra processors were originally designed to challenge Qualcomm in the mobile market. But when it realized that most OEMs wouldn't use Tegra chips, Nvidia pivoted the Tegra line toward Android gaming devices, set-top boxes, and infotainment and telematics systems for cars. 
In recent quarters, demand from the automotive industry has been the core driver of Tegra sales, which rose 10% annually to $160 million (12% of Nvidia's top line) last quarter. Within that total, automotive chip sales rose 47% to $113 million. That growth convinced many investors that connected cars were much more important than Android consoles or set-top boxes to Tegra's future.
The last time Nvidia had a stake in the console market was with the PS3, which was powered by a proprietary GPU it co-developed with Sony. But when the eighth generation of consoles (PS4, Xbox One, Wii U) arrived, all three console makers installed AMD's hardware instead of Nvidia's. 
Sony and Microsoft installed AMD APUs -- which merged CPUs and GPUs together in semi-custom system on chips (SoCs) -- in the PS4 and Xbox One. Nintendo paired an IBM PowerPC processor with an AMD GPU in the Wii U. AMD saw the shutout as a major victory for its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which offset its slower sales of CPUs and GPUs for PCs. 
Nvidia claimed that it ""let"" AMD conquer the console market because the margins were too thin. AMD called Nvidia's declaration a case of ""sour grapes"". Since then, Nvidia's presence in gaming has been an uneven one -- early Tegra-powered Android consoles like the Ouya flopped, while its Shield handheld, tablet, and set-top boxes remain niche devices.

The upgraded PS4 (PS4 Neo) and Xbox One (Scorpio) -- which will be launched with 4K and VR games in mind -- will likely run on upgraded versions of AMD's custom APUs. This means that Nvidia's only way back into the console market is through Nintendo.
Unfortunately, Nintendo has been a laggard in the home console wars. According to industry tracking site Vgchartz, Sony has sold 42.5 million PS4s worldwide, compared to 21.8 million Xbox Ones and 13.2 million Wii Us. But if we include Nintendo's 3DS handheld in the ""eighth generation"", it's actually the best-selling console with 58.7 million units sold. 
Nintendo is trying to leverage its strength in handhelds to straddle the handheld and home console markets with the hybrid NX. Since Nvidia basically tried the same thing with its Tegra-powered Shield tablet -- which converts into an Android ""console"" when hooked up to a TV and a wireless controller -- its CPU (which includes an integrated GPU) is a natural fit for the NX. Using a more power-efficient mobile processor like the Tegra is also necessary to boost the NX's battery life when used as a handheld.
However, Nintendo will likely sacrifice graphical horsepower by using a Tegra instead of an AMD APU. This indicates that Nintendo is more interested in creating a ""unique"" device instead of competing against the PS4, Xbox One, and PC. This means that third-party developers could shun the device, as they did with the Wii U, and force Nintendo to rely mainly on first-party titles. But if the NX is a surprise hit like the original Wii, third-party developers should flock back.
Nintendo's NX might boost sales of Tegra chips when it arrives next year, but it probably won't overtake the importance of connected cars to overall Tegra sales. It probably also won't be a stepping stone back into Sony or Microsoft consoles, since AMD has the market locked down pretty tight with its high-performance APUs.

Growth returned to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) during the second quarter, with the company reporting far higher revenue than analysts were expecting. AMD still posted a loss after backing out a one-time gain from the formation of its assembly and testing joint venture, but that loss was smaller compared to the prior-year period.
The stock surged on the news, with investors betting that AMD's second-quarter results foretell a turnaround during the second half of the year. While AMD showed progress, there are still a few items that need to fall into place before AMD will be able to produce sustained growth and return to profitability. Here's what investors need to know about AMD's second quarter.
AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $1.03 billion, up 9% year over year and $69 million higher than analysts were expecting. The computing and graphics segment, which includes the company's PC CPUs and GPUs, generated $435 million of revenue, up 15% year over year. AMD attributed the increase in sales to higher demand for its notebook processors and GPUs.
The semi-custom segment, which includes game console SoCs as well as embedded and enterprise products, produced $592 million of revenue during the quarter, up 5% year over year. As AMD's share of a shrinking PC market has declined in recent years, its semi-custom business has been a bright spot for the company. The second quarter was no exception.
AMD produced a non-GAAP loss of $40 million, or $0.05 per share, down from a loss of $131 million, or $0.17 per share, during the prior-year period. The average analyst estimate called for a loss of $0.08 per share. Non-GAAP operating profit was positive at $3 million, a milestone that AMD heralded in its earnings press release. The company had previously projected that it would return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second half of the year.
On a GAAP basis, AMD produced an operating loss of $8 million and a net profit of $69 million, or $0.08 per share. A one-time gain of $150 million related to the company's assembly and test joint venture boosted GAAP earnings. Excluding this gain and the related taxes, GAAP net income would have been a loss of about $54 million.
Improvements in profitability came from both segments. The computing and graphics segment produced an operating loss of $81 million, down from a loss of $147 million during the prior-year period. The semi-custom segment offset that loss with an $84 million operating profit, up from just $27 million, with $11 million of operating costs not attributed to either segment. Higher revenue and gross margin, as well as a $26 million licensing gain, drove the improvements compared to the same period last year.
AMD expects its revenue to grow sequentially by 18% during the third quarter, to roughly $1.21 billion. That would represent year-over-year revenue growth of about 14% if AMD hits its guidance. The third quarter is always the strongest for the semi-custom business, with game console inventory being built up for the holiday season, but AMD expects to report year-over-year growth in that segment as well.
AMD reiterated its guidance for revenue growth in 2016 and non-GAAP operating profitability during the second half of the year. Strong semi-custom sales along with the launch of AMD's Polaris graphics cards are expected to drive the company's results. The RX 480, a mainstream card, was launched at the end of June, and AMD will be filling out its lineup of Polaris graphics cards throughout the rest of the year.
While a return to revenue growth and non-GAAP profitability are two important steps in AMD's turnaround, producing GAAP profits excluding one-time gains will require the company to increase its revenue further. Polaris may help AMD win some market share back from NVIDIA, which has built a commanding lead over the past couple of years in the graphics card market. And Zen, AMD's upcoming line of CPUs, is expected to make the company more competitive against Intel.
The success of Polaris and Zen will ultimately determine whether AMD's turnaround gains traction. If either fails to live up to expectations, the signs of progress AMD reported during the second quarter may not mean much in the long run. For now, though, AMD investors are rightfully celebrating the first genuinely positive results from AMD in quite some time.

What: Shares of semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose sharply for the second trading day in a row on Monday, climbing as much as 19%. The stock closed the trading day up 14.7%, or up a total of 28.4% in the past two trading days. The move follows the company's better-than-expected second-quarter results reported after the market closed on Thursday.
So what: AMD stock's move on Monday could be related to continued optimism about the company's second-quarter earnings report, which featured a narrower-than-expected loss per share and higher-than-expected revenue. Further, AMD returned to non-GAAP operating profits one quarter earlier than management had indicated it would.
But other speculation is floating around on Monday, which may have driven some of the optimism surrounding the stock. In particular, Forbes contributor Patrick Moorhead reported AMD sent him a note when he inquired about the company's 14nm chip plans, which he asserts makes him more confident in the company's chip plans. The article can be read in full here.
Now what: Investors should refrain from jumping to any new conclusions about the company based on an analyst note. Investors who are interested in Moorhead's conclusions should reach out directly to the company to verify these facts, or wait for management to confirm what Moorhead is reporting.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has been fighting a losing war against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in high-end GPUs over the past decade. AMD controlled nearly half the dedicated GPU market back in 2006. But by the first quarter of 2016, AMD controlled just 23% of the market, according to research firm JPR, while Nvidia controlled the remaining 77%.
The bears believe that AMD will fall behind Nvidia in GPUs and Intel in CPUs, and end up pigeonholed in niche markets like embedded processors. But there's also a more bullish narrative anchored in virtual reality. 

Image source: Getty Images.
In that thesis, console and headset makers will use AMD's APUs (which combine CPUs and GPUs), because they're generally more cost effective than stand-alone CPUs and GPUs. AMD's new ""VR-ready"" add-in graphics boards could also enable consumers to build cheaper PCs which can run apps for high-end headsets like Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift or HTC and Valve's Vive. Let's discuss that second theory, and see if AMD can challenge Nvidia in the low-end VR-ready GPU market.
AMD's cheapest VR-ready GPU is the RX 480, which has a base clock speed of 1.3 Ghz, 4GB of VRAM, and costs $200. Nvidia's competing device is the GTX 1060, which has a base clock speed of 1.5 Ghz, 6GB of memory, and costs $250.
Early benchmarks on the two devices at PCEVA indicate that the 1060 offers 6%-7% better graphics performance on the latest version of 3DMark's Time Spy DirectX 12 benchmark. Those results are encouraging for AMD, since some customers might question the value of paying 25% more for a 7% performance boost.
They're also better than the ""leaked"" 3DMark Firestrike benchmarks from XFastest in early July, which indicated that the 1060 could outperform the RX 480 by 15%. However, future benchmarks which fully utilize the GTX 1060's higher VRAM could reveal a bigger performance gap between the two cards.

AMD investors should also be wary of two headwinds. First, Nvidia's growth over the past decade has been fueled by robust brand loyalty for its GeForce cards. This arguably enables it to charge a premium on its devices without losing market share to AMD. 
Second, Nvidia has a strong track record of launching more advanced and power efficient chip architectures before AMD. AMD has generally tried to keep pace by boosting clock speeds instead of developing new architectures, which occasionally leads to overheating problems. AMD addressed this perception with a more power efficient 14nm FinNET architecture in its latest GPUs, but the initial launch of the RX 480 was marred by power draw issues -- which were subsequently resolved with a new driver.
Facebook, HTC, Valve, and other PC-based VR headset makers need the price of GPUs to decline to make VR-ready PCs more affordable. Prior to the launch of the RX 480 and GTX 1060, the average price of a VR-ready PC was roughly $1,000. Adding the $600 Oculus Rift or the $800 Vive to that rig made the entire setup a toy for rich gadget enthusiasts instead of mainstream consumers.
New gaming PC builds using the RX 480 or GTX 1060, however, have already reduced the average price to around $700. While that still keeps the price tag of the VR experience well above $1,000, it might attract more mainstream consumers who were looking to upgrade their aging PCs. The prices of Nvidia and AMD's VR-ready cards will likely decline over the next two years, which will make VR-compatible a standard feature on most PCs. 
If that happens, the VR market could grow from nearly nothing today to $30 billion by 2020, as tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital predicts. Headset sales could soar to half a billion units by 2025, according to Piper Jaffray's estimates. 
Nvidia has two distinct advantages over AMD. First, it's allocating most of its R&D and sales/marketing expenses on its GPU business. AMD, however, must allocate those expenses to three fronts -- its GPU battle with Nvidia, its CPU battle with Intel, and its expansion in enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) processors. Nvidia's GAAP operating expenses were nearly 50% higher than AMD's last quarter -- indicating that it has much more cash for big marketing blitzes. 
Second, Nvidia had a GAAP gross margin of 57.5% last quarter, compared to AMD's gross margin of 32%. This means that if AMD gains market share against Nvidia, Nvidia can dramatically lower its prices to regain lost ground. This would be bad for both chipmakers' margins, but gamers and VR headsets would benefit from the arrival of cheaper VR-ready GPUs.
Nvidia has clear advantages in the VR-ready GPU battle, but AMD will likely hold its ground with considerably cheaper GPUs with just slightly lower specs. Therefore, it's unlikely that Nvidia will flush AMD out of the market, but it's equally unlikely that AMD will steal much market share away from Nvidia without triggering a major price war.

This extends the stock's incredible performance recently; shares are up about 190% in the past six months.

So what: Investors are likely upbeat about AMD because the company's loss per share was narrower than expected, and its revenue was higher than expected. Adjusted to exclude one-time items, AMD reported a loss of $0.05 per share, better than analysts' consensus estimate for an $0.08 loss. Revenue increased 9% to $1.027 billion -- above analysts' consensus estimate for revenue of $951.3 million. Further, the company returned to non-GAAP operating profitability one quarter ahead of schedule, reporting non-GAAP operating income of $3 million.
""In the second quarter we accomplished a significant milestone as we returned to non-GAAP operating profitability based on solid execution and strong demand for our semi-custom and graphics products,"" said CEO Lisa Su.
Now what: Going forward, Su is optimistic, expecting strength in the company's semi-custom products and its latest Radeon RX and 7th Generation A-Series APUs ""to drive growth and market share gains in the second half of the year.""

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) launched the first of its long-awaited Polaris graphics cards in June, raising hopes that a turnaround was right around the corner. That turnaround won't be evident in the company's second-quarter results, though, as the RX 480 came at the very beginning of the third quarter. AMD is set to report its second-quarter numbers after the market close on Thursday, July 21. Here's what investors need to know.
AMD managed to beat analyst estimates on all fronts in April when it reported its first-quarter results. Revenue came in at $832 million, down 19% year over year but about $13 million higher than the average analyst estimate. On a non-GAAP basis, AMD posted a loss of $0.12 per share. That number was worse than the $0.09-per-share loss in the prior-year period, but it was a penny better than analysts were expecting.
Along with beating first-quarter expectations, AMD provided guidance for the second quarter that was above what analysts predicted. AMD anticipates growing revenue on a sequential basis by 15%, well above the 7% growth that the average analyst estimate called for.
The biggest news had nothing to do with AMD's results. The company announced that it had licensed its processor and SoC intellectual property to a newly created joint venture targeting the Chinese server market. AMD will receive $293 million in licensing fees, contingent on the JV achieving certain milestones, in addition to royalty payments from future sales.
AMD will be launching new server chips next year based on its upcoming Zen microarchitecture, and the JV offers a second path for AMD to claw back market share. In the near term, the deal bolsters AMD's balance sheet and gives the company more time to turn itself around. In the long term, it improves AMD's chances of reasserting itself in the server chip market.
After a rough few years, analysts forecast that AMD will post growth during the second quarter. The average estimate calls for a 1% year-over-year increase in revenue to $951.6 million, up from $942 million during the prior-year period and in-line with the company's guidance.
AMD is still expected to post a loss, although analysts expect an improvement in that area as well. The average estimate calls for a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, substantially better than the $0.17-per-share loss AMD reported during the same period last year.
Analysts are expecting AMD's results to improve later this year and next year, driven by both Polaris and Zen. The average estimate calls for 0.9% revenue growth in 2016, followed by 5.4% revenue growth in 2017.
AMD's Polaris graphics cards, which target the mainstream portion of the market, won't have an impact on AMD's results until the third quarter. But investors should look for management to give an update on the launch during the company's conference call. The RX 480 garnered positive reviews, and for a brief period, rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) won't have a competitor at the price point AMD is targeting.
But the announcement of NVIDIA's GTX 1060, a $249 card that promises to best the RX 480 in terms of both performance and efficiency, could pose a problem for AMD. The competing card is set to launch on July 19, cutting short the period during which the RX 480 faces no current-generation competition. NVIDIA shipped about 77% of discrete graphics cards during the first quarter, and the GTX 1060 will act as a major obstacle to AMD's plan to win back market share.
The PC version of AMD's Zen CPU is still expected to launch toward the end of this year, although the chips are unlikely to have much of an effect on AMD's results until 2017. Polaris and Zen are the linchpins of AMD's turnaround, and the company will need both to be successful in order to pull itself out of the red.
Shares of AMD have soared so far this year on the hope that the company's turnaround is finally taking shape. The stock is up nearly 90% year to date, a sign that confidence in the company has vastly increased. The second half of 2016 will be the real test of whether AMD's strategy will ultimately pay off. If Polaris or Zen fall short of expectations, AMD investors could be in for a rough ride.

Let me cut to the chase. These two stocks have almost nothing in common.
NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is a solid business with a bright future. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a risky turnaround bet with a lot to prove. Apart from working in the same semiconductor industry, AMD and NXP couldn't be more different if they tried.
That's the view from 30,000 feet. Here's a more detailed version of the same argument.

Breaking down the financial data above, you'll find that NXP is firmly profitable and modestly priced. The stock trades at 2.4 times NXP's book value, which is on the lower end of price-to-book valuations among chip stocks with similar business models.
AMD, on the other hand, shows negative earnings and is burning cash. Sales have fallen 18% over the last four quarterly reports, and the company carries a negative book value. In other words, AMD's financial papers suggest that, if the company were to liquidate its assets, pay off its debts, and return the remainder to shareholders, investors would end up owing money to the debt holders.
Yet, AMD shares have nearly tripled over the last 52 weeks, while NXP shares lost 13%. The long-term picture works out the other way around, with NXP creating shareholder value, and AMD destroying it.
To AMD's credit, the company recently introduced a long-awaited graphics processor platform. The so-called Polaris architecture is locking horns with the equally fresh Pascal technology from arch-rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). That's a refreshing change from recent years, where AMD has been lagging far behind NVIDIA's graphics products in terms of both performance and bang for your buck.
But AMD is priced for perfection, and the company has a long history of making product promises it can't keep. Investors can only hope that AMD's Polaris and the upcoming Zen processors will make the company relevant again. That's a big leap of faith, not a calculated risk. And if the company fails to deliver, share prices would tumble down again. There's not much substance to this business.
The Dutch chipmaker is also betting the farm on a new market, but from a much stronger position than AMD. After merging with sector rival Freescale Semiconductor, the company has become the name to beat in automotive computing. That was a thriving sector when it was just based on a proliferation of semiconductors in modern infotainment and engine control systems. Now, the industry is taking its first trembling steps into self-driving cars.
It seems obvious that true autopilot systems for cars eventually will become commonplace. When that happens, you'll see a radical spike in car-mounted processing muscle. And NXP has built the perfect beast to capture this hockey-stick moment in time.
On top of all that, NXP's broad portfolio of data security and communications solutions would keep the company afloat in case the automotive computing boom rolls off the rails somehow. AMD doesn't have the luxury of a solid Plan B, and absolutely needs its handful of significant innovations to succeed. There is no safety net there.
So there you have it. NXP is already successful, and ready to launch into an even higher orbit as an automotive computing leader. In the opposite corner, AMD investors are betting that the company will ignite a turnaround rocket ride for the ages with the Zen and Polaris chips.
I would much rather invest in NXP's combination of promise and stability than in AMD's unproven hopes and dreams. How about you?

            ","When it comes to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), all eyes are on the company's efforts to reassert itself in the CPU and GPU markets. Ryzen, AMD's new line of PC CPUs, has already debuted, and Naples, the company's upcoming server chip, will arrive in the second quarter. Also coming soon is Vega, AMD's latest effort to wrest the high-end GPU market away from NVIDIA.
These new products are the reason AMD stock has exploded over the past year, up more than 400%. But AMD's most important business right now, and what has kept it afloat over the past few years as it plotted its comeback, is the semi-custom segment. Not only has this segment produced more revenue than the core business in each of the past two years, but its profitability has also partially subsidized AMD's flailing CPU and GPU businesses.
This situation may reverse if AMD's new products pick up some market share, but at the moment the semi-custom business is where AMD makes most of its money.
Sony's PlayStation 4, AMD's first semi-custom design win. Image source: Sony.
AMD's semi-custom business was born along with Sony's PlayStation 4, which launched in 2013. The eight-core semi-custom system on chip (SoC) AMD designed for the console was its first foray into the world of designing a custom chip for a specific customer. Microsoft also turned to AMD for a similar design for the Xbox One, putting the company in a position to benefit from a strong game console cycle.
According to VGChartz, 86.4 million PS4 and Xbox One consoles have been sold worldwide since launch, with each sale bringing in some revenue for AMD. Higher-end versions of both consoles -- the PlayStation 4 Pro and the Xbox One S -- launched last year using updated versions of AMD's SoCs. This provided a midcycle boost for AMD.
The semi-custom segment, which also includes server and embedded processors, generated $2.31 billion of revenue in 2016, up from $2.19 billion in 2015. With AMD's server chip market share essentially zero prior to the launch of Naples, the semi-custom business is responsible for the vast majority of this revenue. AMD's core business, the computing and graphics segment, which includes both PC CPUs and GPUs, managed revenue of just $1.97 billion last year.
The semi-custom segment is also AMD's most profitable segment, aided by the fact that its semi-custom chips are built with technology that was already developed for the core business. Semi-custom segment operating income was $283 million in 2016, up from $215 million in 2015. Meanwhile, the computing and graphics segment posted an operating loss of $238 million in 2016, an improvement from an abysmal $502 million loss in 2015.
As the current console generation matures, a decline in revenue derived from game consoles is inevitable. AMD does have another design win up its sleeve: Microsoft's Project Scorpio game console set to launch this year. But AMD will need some major non-game console deals to fully offset the eventual decline. AMD has previously disclosed that it had secured one non-gaming semi-custom design win, but details have been scarce.
AMD's new CPU and GPU products come at the perfect time, able to offset any revenue declines in the semi-custom business. The high-end variants of Ryzen have already launched, and while reviews were mixed, it's clear that AMD is now in a much-improved competitive position. Naples and Vega still have a lot of unknowns, but even modest market share gains in the server CPU and GPU markets can produce meaningful revenue growth for AMD.
The game consoles will continue to account for a significant amount of AMD's revenue for the next few years. There's no guarantee that the next generation of game consoles includes AMD chips, though, creating a risk that a big chunk of revenue disappears at some point down the line. The recently launched Nintendo Switch is powered by a custom Tegra SoC from NVIDIA, and Sony and Microsoft will have more options the next time around than they did when the PS4 and Xbox One launched.
A year or two from now, AMD's core business will likely be the star of the show, assuming its product launches find some success. But for now, the semi-custom business is the most important part of AMD.

            ","The stock market gained ground on Thursday, but the rise in major market benchmarks was modest at best. The Dow finished up just 15 points after having been higher by as much as 100 points earlier in the session, as investors appeared to grow more cautious despite ongoing signs of economic strength domestically. Many market participants looked at the critical meeting between political leaders of the U.S. and China in Florida as an indicator of future trade relations and potential geopolitical conflict going forward.
Yet even though the market was relatively comfortable with the day's events, some stocks weren't as lucky. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Banco Santander Brasil (NYSE:BSBR) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices dropped 6% after getting a poor rating from analysts at Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street behemoth initiated coverage of the chipmaker with a sell rating, setting a price target of $11 per share, which remains more than 15% below current levels even after today's drop. Analysts argued that AMD's success is unlikely to last because of potential competitive threats from other major players in the space, and Goldman believes that the current share price assumes that AMD will be particularly effective in claiming key wins in the years to come. Anything short of that rosy scenario could hurt the stock, and investors seemed inclined to agree, based on today's trading. That said, even with the drop today, AMD stock is up by more than 400% from its worst levels over the past year, giving longtime investors plenty of gains despite the pullback.

Plug Power stock fell 5%, retreating only very slightly from the better-than-70% gains that the fuel cell specialist enjoyed in Wednesday's session. Those gains stemmed from an agreement that Plug Power made with online retail giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to use fuel-cell and hydrogen-powered equipment and technology in its fulfillment network. In particular, Plug expects to sell its GenKey charging systems to make Amazon's operations more energy-efficient and cut related costs. Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh termed the deal ""a tremendous opportunity for Plug Power to further innovate and grow while helping to support the work Amazon does to pick, pack, and ship customer orders,"" and even those investors who made a lot of money in the stock's run-up on Wednesday chose not to take too much of their profits, anticipating even bigger future gains.
Finally, shares of Banco Santander Brasil fell 6%. The Brazilian unit of the financial giant is having to endure the sale of a portion of a major shareholder's stake in the company, with Qatar Investment Authority's sale of 80 million units of the bank expected to fetch prices that were below what most of those following the stock had hoped to see. Some believe that the hesitation among buyers in the offering stems from the impressive gains that the Brazilian financial institution's shares have seen over the past year and half, which have amounted to a doubling of the stock price. Predictably, the stock has lost ground since the Qatari sovereign wealth fund announced the offering, but once it's complete, some expect Banco Santander Brasil to return to solid performance as long as the Brazilian economy remains on a recovery track.

            ","There are stocks that outperform the market, and then there are some that absolutely crush it, catching investors off guard. It gets even more interesting when stocks that didn't appear too promising end up with market-thumping returns, somewhat like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and United Rentals (NYSE:URI), as our contributors explain below. 
Tim Green (Advanced Micro Devices): I suggested last April that shares of AMD, then trading for less than $3 per share, could soar if investor sentiment toward the stock improved. That's exactly what happened, to a surprising degree. AMD stock is now up more than 400% from the date of that article.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD has yet to produce results that justify all of the optimism now surrounding the stock. Its mainstream Polaris graphics cards were launched last year, but the company still produced an adjusted net loss of $117 million. Investors are betting that AMD's 2017 product launches, which include Ryzen PC CPUs, Naples server CPUs, and Vega high-end GPUs, will finally return it to the black. They very well may, but with a market capitalization of nearly $14 billion and sales of just $4.3 billion, anything short of significant market share gains will prove disappointing.
The company has only launched the highest-end Ryzen CPUs so far this year, with lower-end versions, Naples, and Vega still to come. Whether AMD remains a winning stock in 2017 depends on how these products fare. The high-end Ryzen 7 series received mixed reviews, praised for its multicore performance but criticized for its gaming performance. If all of AMD's launches this year are mixed bags, the euphoria surrounding the stock could fade away.
Neha Chamaria (United Rentals): Who'd think a company that's into a business as boring as renting equipment out to the construction industry could see its stock double in one year? That's the story of United Rentals, one of the top three S&P 500 performers in the past year. As of this writing, United Rentals is up a staggering 113% in one year.
You can credit the presidential elections as the event that triggered the huge run-up in the rental company's stock. Or more specifically, President Donald Trump's campaign promises of rebuilding America's infrastructure, which, if acted on, should mean brisk business for United Rentals.
The fact that United Rentals crushed analysts' estimates of adjusted profits per share and credited ""broad-based demand"" for it when it reported its fourth-quarter numbers in January further fueled investors' optimism. CEO Michael Kneeland even went on to say that 2017 should be ""a year of notable growth"" for several reasons, including its acquisition of NES Rentals, improving consumer sentiment, and the ongoing strength in key leading indicators for the industry. At the same time, Kneeland didn't hesitate saying ""it's too early to call"" when referring to the optimism around a possible government infrastructure stimulus package.
So in a way, United Rentals' crazy run-up is surprising. The stock is highly susceptible to macro factors, and no one really knows how policies under Trump's administration will pan out. The company's net profits have hardly budged in the past couple of years, though it generated strong free cash flows last year. I wouldn't call United Rentals too pricey at 19 times trailing earnings, especially given its forward P/E estimate of only 14. United Rentals may not grow gangbusters, but it is clearly already on the growth track. That should keep the stock moving higher, just maybe not as much as in the past year.
Jordan Wathen (Facebook): When Facebook went public, I thought the only path to growth was squeezing more revenue from every user. The only way to do it, as far as I saw it, was to push more ads into every bit of content, killing the user experience. In short, I thought it would be impossible for Facebook to grow into its valuation -- there just weren't many levers left to pull.
I couldn't have been more wrong. Facebook's advertising revenue per user grew from $9.51 per user in the U.S. and Canada in the full year of 2011 to $19.28 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016. All in all, Facebook is generating about six times more revenue from its average U.S. and Canada user last year than it did prior to its IPO. The majority of the incremental revenue flows straight to the bottom line, resulting in rapidly growing profits.
Realistically, I missed a few things when I looked at Facebook. I missed how important mobile would be to getting its users more engaged, generating more ad impressions, and protecting Facebook from ad-blocker losses. I also missed just how much more room Facebook had to grow in terms of users, both acquired (Instagram and WhatsApp) and from organic growth. I comfort myself knowing that I only missed out on five-year returns of about 270% at the worst and more than 600% in the best case.

            ","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...
Shares of semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are in free fall this morning, knocked for a loop by a giant sell rating from Wall Street's Goldman Sachs. After closing at $14.17 on Wednesday, the stock fell as far as $12.83 in early Thursday trading -- so the ""good"" news here is that it's now down only 7%.
Here are three things you need to know about why.
Goldman Sachs' sell rating shocked AMD investors this morning. Image source: Getty Images.
Completely out of the blue, Goldman Sachs initiated AMD stock with a sell rating and an $11-per-share price target this morning. If the analyst is right about that, it means AMD investors stand to lose 22% in market capitalization on their AMD shares over the course of the next year.
Already, the stock is down 7% in response to Goldman's rating, suggesting worried investors are taking the analyst's warning to heart -- and don't want to stick around for more losses. But are those fears justified? Isn't Goldman's sell rating just one opinion in a sea of opinions about AMD?
At its heart, Goldman Sachs' sell rating is a valuation argument. Investors are betting on a big improvement in AMD's business as consumers warm to its line of Ryzen microprocessors, and they like its growing prospects in PC gaming, artificial intelligence, and computer deep learning. Many analysts who follow the stock believe that AMD will enjoy rapidly rising revenue (and profits) over the coming years.
On average, analysts quoted on S&P Global Market Intelligence are calling for AMD's revenue to grow nearly 50% over the next four years -- and for operating profits to grow 16-fold. But as explained in a write-up on TheFly.com this morning, Goldman believes the potential improvement in fundamentals has already been priced into the shares. As a result, while some appreciation in stock price may have been justified, now that the stock is up nearly five times in two years, the current risk-return profile is unfavorable.
Priced today at nearly 44 times next year's profits (i.e., profits AMD is not even guaranteed to earn), Goldman sees AMD's current stock price as ""difficult to justify.""
Most analysts on Wall Street expect to see AMD turn profitable as soon as next year (earning a GAAP $0.11 per share, and $0.25 pro forma). Goldman, however, warns that that's a ""very bullish"" view -- and likely not to be correct given pricing pressure from even larger semiconductor powerhouses Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Goldman's best guess? NVIDIA will earn only $0.14 per share pro forma next year, which implies an actual, GAAP profit of zero dollars, zero cents.
And Goldman Sachs' argument makes sense. As the analyst explains it, there's certainly a possibility that AMD will succeed in winning market share this year with its powerful Ryzen chips. But even if it does succeed, then Intel and NVIDIA would probably try to lead customers back to the fold by offering price concessions on their own chips.
The result would be short-term revenue gains for AMD, followed by margin compression on that revenue later in 2017 and heading into 2018 as the company is forced to cut its own prices to fend off competition from Intel and NVIDIA. So what would that portend for AMD investors?
According to S&P Global data, AMD hasn't succeeded in posting a full-year profit since 2011, a year in which its operating profit margin surpassed 7%. Currently, that margin is coming in just shy of negative 9%. So while it's possible it will improve for a quarter or two, the end result of the moves AMD's rivals would make to counteract its gains in market share would likely plunge AMD's profit margin right back into a bath of red ink -- and deny the company the ability to report a profit in 2018.
Investors betting on a return to GAAP profitability at AMD may have to wait a bit longer to see it.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trying to take the game to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in server chips with its Naples platform. However, this is easier said than done as Intel owns the server-chip market hands down with a market share of over 90%. In fact, its dominance in this market is so absolute that the chip giant's products accounted for 99.3% of server chip shipments in the third quarter of 2016.
AMD, therefore, needed to come up with a game-changing product before even thinking of shaking Intel's vice-like grip over this market. But it believes that its Naples high-performance server processor is capable enough to unsettle the market leader.
AMD previewed its Naples server processor in the first week of March. It showed a product packed with high-end specs to gain a performance advantage over Intel. The company claims that the Naples architecture has 45% more cores and 122% more bandwidth memory than its competitor.
Image source: AMD. 
This competitor is none other than Intel, and AMD made that clear by demonstrating the capabilities of its platform against Intel's fastest server offering, a 2-socket Xeon chip, in a number of scenarios involving seismic analysis that's used to locate natural-resource deposits. Not surprisingly, AMD Naples was the faster chip in all the scenarios.
As it turns out, AMD Naples can process a workload two times faster than the Intel Xeon when both are running the same number of cores and identical memory bandwidth. The performance gain jumps to 2.5 times when Naples runs more cores and a higher memory bandwidth.
AMD's strategy of bringing a more powerful chip indicates that it could do better on the performance front, though we would have to wait for the actual results as Naples will be launched in the second quarter. This is why investors should take the faster benchmark performance with a grain of salt until and unless independent tests establish Naples' supremacy over Intel's product.
AMD has a pretty solid reason for going against Intel to tap the server-chip market with a solution that has superior specs. The global market for data-center servers could grow at an annual pace of 4.89% until 2021, according to Technavio's Data Center Server Market report. This should create a stronger demand for server chips as they play a mission-critical role of enabling fast data transfer over the network in data centers.
Now, an explosion of data will drive data-center workloads higher. The Cisco Global Cloud Index projects that traffic related to cloud data centers will jump a whopping 262% in 2020 from 2015 levels, with 92% of the workload being processed in the cloud. This is where AMD's Naples will come into play, as it seems capable of handling more workload due to higher specifications if the benchmarks are taken at face value.
What's more, modular data centers can also use AMD's server chips to tackle the growing workload as they provide incremental capacity to the existing infrastructure, apart from being used in remote areas. This could be a big deal for AMD as Markets and Markets expects the modular data-center infrastructure market to grow threefold by the end of the decade.
AMD, however, is not going to have a free run given Intel's near-monopoly in this space, as the latter won't wait for its rivals to eat into its market share. Additionally, Intel's response to AMD's potential threat is yet to come, which could make the game interesting if the company comes out with a more powerful offering.
But Intel needs to be on its toes because the high-performance Naples platform could help AMD carve out a small piece of the server-chip market for itself as it solves the problem of greater workloads in data centers.

            ","If it weren't already obvious that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is moving deeper into the data center, now we have it in black and white. The rickety PC market is not a strategic focus anymore, but heavy-duty number crunching is.
The strategic shift was stated in plain English this week, baked into an announcement that longtime vice president Aicha Evans will be shouldering the newly created title of Intel's chief strategy officer.
Image source: Intel.
From the announcement, with the key portion highlighted in italics:
""She will be responsible for driving Intel's long-term strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, as well as leading rapid decision making and companywide execution of the strategy.""
Intel's chief strategy officer, Aicha Evans. Image source: Intel.
There you have it. Evans is tasked with moving Intel away from the floundering PC market and into the vibrant data analysis sector. The shift is companywide and needs to be done quickly.
The plainspoken statement comes just weeks after Intel started launching its $15.3 billion acquisition of automotive computing specialist Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). In August of 2016, the company picked up data processing specialist Nervana, which designs hyper-specialized chips for artificial intelligence, data analysis, and deep-learning systems. Those are just two of the most high-profile moves Intel has made toward the data center market lately. The full list is much longer.
Intel rivals NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are exploring the same strategic direction from their own unique angles, unlocking a ton of shareholder value in the process. NVIDIA shares have tripled over the last year as the company's latest generation of graphics processors was embraced by big-iron system builders and moved into the data center. AMD's equally fresh graphics platform is taking the same tack, yielding a nearly 400% shareholder return in 52 weeks.
The data center is at the heart of Intel's traditional hunting grounds, and the company won't stand for smaller rivals stepping in to steal all of the thunder. The Nervana buyout is a direct attack on NVIDIA and AMD, and Aicha Evans will make sure to drive that point home.
We Intel shareholders can't expect the stock to double or triple overnight, of course. It's an industry giant, poised to strike at much smaller challengers. It takes more work to move Intel's larger business needle.
But the writing is on the wall: Intel is going there with a focused purpose and high speed.
AMD and NVIDIA must have seen this coming from miles away, but their investors should still be shaking in their boots.

            ","Many semiconductor stocks surged in 2016, thanks to rising demand for chips across multiple industries. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks many of the top names in the sector, rallied almost 50% over the past 12 months. 
But despite that robust performance, some semiconductor stocks could rise even further this year. Let's take a look at three chip plays that still have room to run: Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).
Image source: Getty Images.
Xilinx is the largest maker of FPGA (field programmable gate array) chips in the world. These chips can be reprogrammed after being installed, making them well suited for a wide variety of machines -- including servers, connected cars, smart appliances, and airplanes. FPGAs are usually paired with traditional CPUs to handle industry-specific tasks. That's why Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) acquired Xilinx's only meaningful rival, Altera, in late 2015.
That acquisition made Xilinx -- which launched 16nm chips a year before Intel caught up with 14nm ones -- a rumored takeover target for larger chipmakers like Qualcomm. The Altera acquisition also convinced Intel's chipmaking rivals, like Qualcomm and IBM, to pair their CPUs with Xilinx's FPGAs to match Intel's new programmable capabilities.
Wall Street expects Xilinx's revenue and earnings to respectively grow 6% and 11% this year. It pays a forward dividend yield of 2.3%, and it's raised that payout annually for six straight years. Xilinx's P/E of 25 is a bit higher than its industry average of 22, but its growing network of partnerships and attractiveness as a takeover target shouldn't be ignored.
Micron is often more volatile than other semiconductor stocks because demand for its DRAM and NAND memory chips is cyclical. Demand for those chips was sluggish throughout most of 2016, due to a slowdown in PC sales, the commoditization of the mobile device market, and a glut of memory chips crushing market prices. 
Image source: Micron.
However, those trends reversed in late 2016, as many device makers reported shortages of memory chips and rising prices. That's why Micron posted double-digit sales growth over the past two quarters, which ended six straight quarters of annual declines. Analysts expect Micron's revenue to rise 57% this year and for its non-GAAP earnings to surge from $0.06 to $2.42. 
Micron rallied more than 170% over the past 12 months, but it trades at just six times forward earnings -- indicating that the market remains pretty bearish on its chances (I'd argue that it's overly bearish). However, investors should beware of two major headwinds. First, competition from larger players like Samsung and Western Digital's SanDisk could still put pressure on Micron's margins. Second, Micron warned that Chinese chipmakers could flood the memory market with cheap chips in the near future, which could push Micron into a downward cycle again.
AMD's upside potential might seem limited after rising nearly 400% over the past 12 months. Yet investors shouldn't ignore the chipmaker's compelling comeback story. After years of being squeezed in x86 CPUs by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and high-end GPUs by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD carved out a growing niche in EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) chipsets for gaming consoles and other devices.
Image source: AMD.
That move enabled AMD to post three straight quarters of positive year-over-year sales growth -- which broke a two-year streak of top-line declines. Analysts expect AMD's revenue to rise 11% this year and for it to achieve non-GAAP profitability again following multiple years of net losses. 
As for AMD's valuation, its EV/sales ratio of 3.1 remains comparable to Intel's ratio of three and much lower than NVIDIA's ratio of 8.6.
Besides gaming consoles, AMD plans to turn up the heat on NVIDIA with more low-end VR-ready GPUs and its next-gen Vega GPUs. It also plans to strike back at Intel with its new Ryzen chips, which offer comparable performance as Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake chips at lower price points. Those efforts could lift AMD to new highs, but the stock could also plunge if demand for these chips falls short of expectations.
Xilinx, Micron, and AMD could all climb higher this year, but each of these companies face clear risks -- Xilinx faces upcoming FPGA battles with Intel, Micron faces challenges from bigger chipmakers, and AMD must land some meaningful blows against Intel and NVIDIA to maintain is momentum. Therefore, investors should carefully weigh these pros and cons before buying any of these semiconductor stocks.

            ","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has enjoyed a near-monopoly in the server chip market in recent years, with a market share of roughly 99%. Its x86 chips are the standard, and without any real competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), the only other x86 chip maker, Intel has been free to enjoy its dominance.
Operating margin in Intel's data center segment has routinely topped 50%, and the growth of cloud computing has driven both revenue and profits higher. During 2016, the data center segment generated $17.2 billion of revenue and a whopping $7.5 billion of operating income.

The company is now warning that data center growth will slow and margins will contract, reflecting a return of competition to the server chip market and its plan to bring server chips to new process nodes before PC chips. Intel expects sales of its server CPUs to grow by just 6% annually through 2021, and for its data center operating margin to drop to the low- to mid- 40% range.
These lower estimates may not be pessimistic enough. Intel faces three distinct threats in the data center, all of which could eat away at its market share and its margins.
AMD's server chip business has been insignificant for quite some time. The company was once a major force, with a roughly 26% unit share of the x86 server chip market in 2006. But it has been outclassed by Intel ever since, driving its market share down near zero.
AMD will make its return to the server chip market later this year when it launches Naples, server chips built on its Zen architecture. AMD has already launched Ryzen, the PC version of Zen, and while reviews have been mixed, AMD has significantly closed its performance gap with Intel. AMD still can't compete when it comes to single-threaded performance, but Ryzen's copious cores and competitive pricing make the chips a clear winner for certain workloads.
Naples will come with up to 32 cores, and AMD is touting memory bandwidth and input/output capacity as the key selling points. Compared to a comparable Intel Xeon chip, AMD claims that Naples will have 45% more cores, 60% more I/O capacity, and 122% more memory bandwidth. If Ryzen is any indication, Naples will certainly be superior for some workloads, but it's unlikely to best Intel in general.
Still, Naples should make AMD a player in the server chip market once again, forcing Intel to compete for the first time in years. Exactly how much market share AMD will be able to win is anyone's guess, but it's all downside for Intel.
Beyond AMD and x86 chips, there are two other threats to Intel's server chip monopoly. ARM chips are finally making their way to the data center, with Microsoft recently announcing that its Project Olympus server design now supports both x86 and ARM chips. The company is already testing ARM chips from Qualcomm and Cavium for search, storage, and machine learning, and it has created a version of Windows Server for ARM processors.
Microsoft isn't the only cloud computing company looking to lower its dependence on Intel. Alphabet's Google announced last year that it was developing an open server architecture that supports the upcoming POWER9 processor from IBM. Google's toolchain fully supported POWER at the time of the announcement, allowing the company to use POWER processors in conjunction with chips from Intel.
The push from the major cloud infrastructure providers to support different architectures isn't surprising. Shifting from a world where Intel is the only option to a world where there are a multitude of options will surely bring server chip prices down, allowing cloud computing to get cheaper and further eat into the traditional server market.
The glory days of Intel's server chip empire are coming to an end. The data center segment will continue to throw off plenty of cash for Intel, but market share and margins are going to take a hit. It's impossible to predict exactly how much share Intel will lose, or how far its margins will fall. But it's safe to say that Intel's server chip monopoly isn't long for this world.

            ","After a strong showing late last week as the Federal Reserve opted to increase interest rates, the stock market was mostly flat on Monday, with major indexes fluctuating between positive and negative territory. But amid a flurry of encouraging analyst notes, there were a few individual companies that managed to buck the trend, and shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among those stocks that delivered outsized gains today. Let's take a closer look at what drove these unusual moves.
Shares of AMD climbed more than 7% as two optimistic analysts chimed in regarding the prospects of the company's new Ryzen 7 chips. First, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated his buy rating on AMD stock, but also increased his per-share price target to $16 from $13. To justify his bullishness, Lipacis noted AMD's Ryzen 7 (which was launched on March 2, 2017) and Ryzen 5 (which will be available on April 11, 2017) processors should help the company take significant market share considering they offer comparable performance and more attractive pricing than similar chips from Intel. Lipacis further cited the potential for further share gains and revenue growth to come from the launch of AMD's more affordable Ryzen 3 processors later this year, noting they believe the company is still ""in the early innings of its multi-year turnaround story.""
And AMD received more love in a separate note today from Susquehenna's Christopher Rolland, who maintained his own neutral rating on the stock but similarly increased his per-share price target to $12 from $9. Rolland outlined his belief that AMD is likely to exceed Wall Street's consensus revenue expectations in the coming quarter thanks to the Ryzen line's ongoing rollout, especially as sales to larger PC original equipment manufacturers like HP and Dell should commence as early as next month.

Meanwhile, after falling 27% over the past two weeks, shares of Snapchat parent Snap Inc. climbed as much as 4.7% -- but settled to gains of 2% at market close -- after the stock received its first buy rating, courtesy of Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak. 
More specifically, Cakmak initiated coverage on Snap stock with a buy rating and price target of $25 per share, a healthy premium over Snap's current price just shy of $20 per share. But while Cakmak believes Snap should continue to outgrow its competition, he appeared to temper his enthusiasm by stating, ""We recognize we are potentially giving too much credit for unproven skills in building a business, rather than just a product, but we see more to Snap than many suggest.""
With Snap shares having given up much of their initial gains following the company's IPO earlier this month, it's not terribly surprising to see Wall Street taking notice.
Finally, shares of NVIDIA jumped more than 3% on the day as Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated the graphics chip specialist's status on his firm's ""Conviction Buy"" list with a $130-per-share price target. Tari technically didn't boost his already positive opinion of NVIDIA, but he did express admiration for the importance of NVIDIA's off-the-shelf machine learning models and customer support after attending NVIDIA's Deep Learning Connect event in London last week.
Moreover, Hari believes NVIDIA's planned strategic investments in the automotive, data center, and enterprise markets should be able to drive results similar to its successful core gaming segment. So even with shares having more than tripled over the past year, the analyst believes NVIDIA shares should have plenty more room to run.

            ","The first batch of Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) Ryzen PC CPUs launched on March 2 to mixed reviews. The Ryzen 7 series, all high-end chips aimed at competing with Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) best, offers impressive performance in applications capable of utilizing all eight cores. For the price, especially considering that Intel's 6-10 core Broadwell-E chips are extremely expensive, Ryzen 7 looks like a great choice for workstation and professional applications.
But Ryzen 7 fell short in applications where single-threaded performance mattered. While AMD's new chips offer a massive leap in performance over the previous generation, they're still no match for Intel in situations where more cores provide little to no benefit. Gaming is the most prominent example, with third-party reviews putting Intel's cheaper four-core i7-7700k ahead of even the most expensive Ryzen chip in nearly every gaming benchmark.
AMD will have another shot to impress gamers in April. The company plans to launch four mainstream Ryzen 5 CPUs on April 11, priced to compete with Intel's own mainstream offerings. While Ryzen 7 was meant to turn heads with its impressive multicore performance, Ryzen 5 may end up being more disruptive.
Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
AMD's Ryzen 5 chips will be priced between $169 and $249, comprised of two hex-core and two quad-core options. The $249 hex-core 1600X, essentially a Ryzen 7 1800X with two cores disabled, will be the most expensive, roughly the same price as Intel's i5-7600K. The $219 1600 will also feature six cores, but a lower clock speed will slow it down. The $189 1500X and $169 1400 will both come with four cores, going after Intel's lower-end offerings.
Independent third-party reviews are still weeks away, but it's safe to say that Ryzen 5 will wipe the floor with comparably priced Intel chips in scenarios that benefit from more cores. AMD claims that the 1600X beats Intel's 7600K by 69% in a cherrypicked multicore benchmark, not a surprise given that it has 50% more cores and triple the threads.
Single-threaded performance will still be an issue, just as it was with Ryzen 7. But the 1600X could end up far more attractive for PC gamers due to the lower price. While multithreaded performance will be worse than its high-end eight-core siblings, gaming performance shouldn't be too far off from the 1800X in many games. The gaming performance that the 1800X delivers isn't worth its $499 price tag. But a $249 price tag is a different story.
We'll have to wait and see how these new chips perform against Intel's products. If the 1600X provides similar gaming performance as the highest-end Ryzen chip, it will certainly shake up the mainstream PC CPU market. It will be no match in terms of raw single-threaded performance for Intel's more expensive i7-7700K, but the price-to-performance ratio could make the 1600X a popular chip.
AMD will further fill out its CPU lineup during the second half of the year with its Ryzen 3 line of low-end products. With prices topping out below $169 and likely featuring only quad-core chips, perhaps even dual-core chips, Ryzen 3 will be aimed at Intel's budget offerings.
Ryzen so far has been a mixed bag. There's no question that AMD has accomplished a lot, greatly improving performance over its previous line of chips. AMD claims that Ryzen achieves 52% higher instructions-per-clock, a measure of single-threaded performance, an impressive feat. But that gain also reflects how abysmal single-threaded performance has been on AMD chips in recent years.
Intel likely won't sit still if AMD begins to win considerable market share, so there's no guarantee that Ryzen will lead to the kind of profits that investors are expecting. AMD stock is up about 375% over the past year, reflecting a fervent optimism that may end up being a bit too intense. Ryzen is a big step forward for AMD, but whether it will be enough to justify those gains remains to be seen.

            ","Warren Buffet famously said that the best time to sell a stock is never. While not even the Oracle of Omaha strictly adheres to that rule, investors still should have an appropriately long time horizon for the companies they put their money into. At least three to five years is a minimum; a decade is better, and decades is best.
Still, when companies make huge moves in a short period of time, it's worthwhile to see what the catalysts were that caused them to explode in value. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Chemours (NYSE:CC), and KEMET (NYSE:KEM) are three stocks that soared in value over the past year so that had you invested $3,000 in any one of them, you'd be looking at a $15,000 gain -- or better! Let's see why they made the moves they did.
Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
It was a long time coming, but Advanced Micro Devices posted its first adjusted profits in 2016. The last time the chipmaker was in the black, at least on a non-GAAP basis, was 2011, and after wandering in the wilderness for so long, it was a welcome homecoming.
The basis for the gains was its ability to carve out a niche supplying chips for the gaming industry as the PC business declined. Early on in 2016, it signed a deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment to license server chip designs for new processors for gaming consoles from Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, and it has recognized $88 million from the deal so far.
A lot of the sentiment in favor of AMD has depended on the ability of its Polaris, Vega, and Ryzen (aka Zen) architectures to gain share in the GPU and CPU markets, as well as sign more IP licensing deals with customers. By doing so, it has once again emerged as a competitive second source to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which it's planning to challenge with its new Ryzen processors and Naples server chips.  
However, the company is also reportedly willing to partner with its rival in a bid to take on NVIDIA. It will reportedly feature Intel's CPUs alongside its own GPUs in what can only be described as a case of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend.""
There's still a lot of ground for Advanced Micro Devices to make up, but that seems to bode well for further gains in its stock, which has risen from well under $3 a share in March 2016 to over $14 a stub today. The 436% gain would have turned $3,000 into more than $16,000 in just one year.
Image source: Chemours. 
Spun off from DuPont (NYSE:DD) in 2015, performance chemicals specialist Chemours was seen as set up for failure from the beginning, with lots of debt and toxic assets its former parent wanted to shield itself from. The titanium dioxide market that had bolstered the balance sheets of DuPont, Dow Chemical, Kronos Worldwide, and Huntsman, the world's four largest producers of the white pigment, also imploded.
However, though it initially lost 85% of its value in its first seven months as a separate company, Chemours has gone on to be a star performer. It did so by cutting expenses and its workforce, and by shedding or shutting non-core assets. In 2016, Chemours reduced costs by $200 million, improved operating cash flows by $412 million, and retired $385 million in long-term debt. While the TiO2 business it inherited from DuPont is still weak, the performance chemicals leader was still able to raise prices last year, showing it still possesses substantial power in the industry and allowing it to more than double its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margins to $157 million.
Shares of Chemours have gone from less than $7 each to over $33, a better than 400% gain that would have transformed $3,000 into more than $15,000. It still has some substantial risks ascribed to it, but it's a much better business than it was when it first hit the public markets.
Image source: KEMET.
The world's largest manufacturer of solid tantalum capacitors and one of the biggest makers of multilayer ceramic capacitors used across automotive, communications, and military and aerospace industries, KEMET has been on the rise since the November elections, perhaps on the promise by President Trump of increased infrastructure spending that would dwarf the stimulus spending package of his predecessor.
However, last month, KEMET's stock surged nearly 23% in one day after announcing it was acquiring NEC TOKIN, a Japanese manufacturer of tantalum capacitors, in which it had already owned a substantial stake. While the purchase brings new capabilities under KEMET's purview and enhances existing lines, there seems to be little reason for the outsized gains the deal generated.
When KEMET originally took a stake in TOKIN, regulators had no problem signing off on the deal because there were no competitive concerns raised, and it would only increase KEMET's market share incrementally. Of course, that was a few years ago, and now KEMET will own the entire company, but the playing field does appear to have been significantly altered to warrant the outsized gain.
Even so, KEMET's stock is up 440% over the past year, most of it since November, when it went from trading around $3.60 per share to today, where it stands north of $11 a share. That would mean it would have turned $3,000 into more than $16,000. Considering it had been trading sideways for much of 2016, those gains have largely occurred in about just four months' time, making its compounded growth rate really much larger.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a fantastic water cooler stock these days. The ticker sports enormous trading volumes and equally impressive amounts of investor chatter, and all for good reason: AMD shares have gained an outrageous 440% over the last 52 weeks, producing huge returns for investors.
But maybe it's time to redirect some of those AMD profits into a different stock. If you love AMD's stock and business plan, you should probably take a closer look at Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) right now.
Image source: Getty Images.
Broadcom is one of the largest semiconductor businesses in the world. Since the $37 billion merger with Avago in 2016, the company has been an undisputed leader in important sectors such as wired and wireless network tools, data storage controllers, and automotive computing.
The company is both diverse and strictly focused, picking its target markets with meticulous precision and selling off unwanted operations. For example, Broadcom sold its wireless Internet of Things (IoT) product portfolio last summer to smaller rival Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY), collecting a $550 million check while sharpening its business focus. IoT networking is a promising growth market, but could also serve as a distraction from Broadcom's core business operations -- so off to Cypress went the division.
It's a growth story in progress, with strong narratives for the top and bottom lines -- as well as shareholder returns. Broadcom was actually smaller than AMD in many ways just a few years ago, but has worked its way up:

AVGO Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
Past performance is not the same as future returns, of course. No one can guarantee that Broadcom's positive long-term trends will continue forever. On the other hand, the same dictum also applies to AMD's recent surge.
Let's be clear about this: AMD is a turnaround story, searching for traction in highly competitive markets. Recent technology updates led to strong sales in both the graphics processor and desktop/notebook markets, giving the company and its investors a welcome break from a long string of failures and disappointments.
That huge one-year price surge started from the bottom of a deep trough. Share prices had been sliced in half over the previous two years, diving 30% lower in 52 weeks. Even now, after that huge bounce, AMD's five-year returns and results pale in comparison to Broadcom's steady improvements:

AVGO data by YCharts.
Buying AMD now is a gamble. You're betting that the company's turnaround efforts will continue to pay off in the face of high-quality competition and a poor track record. Current share prices are built on hopes and dreams and flimsy financials.
Broadcom offers a large and stable financial platform, from which the company launches forays into highly targeted markets. This company is an established leader with a top-notch management team, producing annual cash flows roughly the size of AMD's total revenue.

            ","NVIDIA claims the GTX 1080 Ti is 35% faster than the TITAN X Pascal-based GPU, which is used for deep learning and artificial intelligence. It's priced at $699 -- about half the cost of the TITAN X's $1,200 price tag.
NVIDIA holds a commanding lead in the gaming GPU market. Image source: NVIDIA. 
One way NVIDIA is able to design its latest gaming GPUs to run faster than TITAN X is through advanced cooling solutions, which allows the GTX 1080 Ti, for example, to run at higher clock speeds while dissipating heat more efficiently.
The GTX 1080 Ti packs plenty of horsepower to run the latest games smoothly on 4K and 5K resolution displays. The new graphics card was also designed to power virtual reality (VR) games. It is important for NVIDIA to hold its lead in being the card of choice for gamers, because gaming is NVIDIA's largest revenue category. 
NVIDIA's gaming revenue grew 44% in fiscal 2017 to $4.06 billion, fueled by gamer adoption of new GPUs that feature the latest Pascal card design. Strong demand should continue, as the majority of PC gamers have not upgraded to a Pascal GPU yet. According to CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA has an installed GeForce user base of ""a couple of 100 million."" As to how far along in the upgrade cycle those users are, he said:
We've upgraded about two quarters of them, as in two operating quarters out of four years. It takes about three to four years to upgrade the entire installed base. And we started ramping Pascal, as you know, a few quarters ago. And our data would suggest that the upgrade cycle is going well, and we have plenty to go.
Gamers are enthusiastic to get their hands on the $700 GTX 1080 Ti; it sold out quickly on NVIDIA's website. Valve Corporation's recent Steam Hardware Survey updated for February shows gamers rapidly adopting Pascal-based GPUs such as the GTX 1070 and GTX 1060. Steam is one of the most popular PC gaming distribution platforms. Here's the percentage of Steam users who use either the GTX 1060 or GTX 1070 model for each month going back to October:
Data source: February Steam hardware survey. 
The launch of the new GTX 1080 Ti at the $699 price point allowed the company to lower the price of the GTX 1080 by $100, which should assist the upgrade cycle and could help the company hold its top market share position. 
The launch of the new GPU is significant for NVIDIA as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gets set to debut its new Vega GPU in the second quarter of 2017. The new Vega GPUs will target gaming enthusiasts as well as data centers, competing head-to-head with NVIDIA's GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti. Early reports suggest AMD's upcoming Vega GPU is 10% faster than NVIDIA's GTX 1080.
AMD has lost considerable market share to NVIDIA in the last few years, making 2017 a pivotal year in the high-end GPU market. The latest data from Jon Peddie Research shows NVIDIA holding 70.5% share of the discrete GPU market. This is way ahead of AMD's 29.5% share. With the pre-emptive announcement of the GTX 1080 Ti, NVIDIA is not resting on its laurels.
As of now, NVIDIA is the card of choice for gamers. The company has successfully won the top market share spot by outmaneuvering the competition on performance and price. Under the leadership of CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA also positioned its GPU business to benefit from applications outside of gaming like deep learning and autonomous vehicles, leaving AMD in the dust in these areas.
On the flip side, AMD has kept itself afloat by supplying GPUs for Apple's 27-inch Retina iMac and MacBook Pro computers in order to ride the tide of the iPhone maker's strength in the PC market. AMD's mobile GPU shipments have been strong of late due to the launch of the Radeon Pro 400 GPU and demand for Apple's MacBook Pro notebooks.
NVIDIA's stock is priced for perfection, so any signs of competition creeping up on the company could send the stock tumbling. Therefore, the reaction from the gaming community to AMD's second-quarter launch of its new Vega GPU will be important for investors to watch.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) stock jumped 19.9% in February, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, mainly on the company's strong fourth-quarter 2016 earnings and full-year 2016 report.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD said its revenue hit $1.11 billion for the quarter, up 15% year over year, due to strong sales of the company's GPUs. Investors were also likely pleased to see the AMD's gross margin improve to 32%, a year-over-year increase of 2 percentage points.
Adding to the excitement was AMD's full-year revenue of $4.27 billion, up 7% from 2015. Net losses for the year subsided from $419 million in 2015 to just $117 million for the full-year 2016.
AMD managed to increase sales across all of its major segments in the fourth quarter, bumping up its revenue from its computing and graphics segment by 28% and improving enterprise, embedded and semi-custom revenue by 4%, both on a year-over-year basis.
On the company's earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su said, ""As we look back on 2016, we successfully accomplished our key priorities, including growing discrete graphic share led by Polaris GPU adoption [and] regaining client compute share led by our seventh generation APUs,"" and added that the company also reduced debt and increased its cash.
Su went on to say that as the company heads into 2017 it's seeing ""strong revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities"" from its Zen-based CPUs and Vega GPUs.""
AMD's stock has been riding very high as of late -- it's up 490% over the past 12 months -- and investors are still looking for more. Whether they'll get it or not remains to be seen. AMD's management said that for the first quarter of 2017, the company expects revenue to decrease by roughly 11% sequentially, though it would be an 18% year-over-year increase at the midpoint.
But AMD's full-year outlook still remains strong. Su said on the call, ""[B]ased on our current market expectations and the strength of our upcoming products, we are confident we can grow annual revenue, expand gross margin, and deliver non-GAAP net income in 2017.""

            ","Some of the best investments can be the most popular. On the other hand, getting caught up in the herd -- while ignoring what's actually happening with the business itself -- can be a surefire way to leave yourself with a smaller investment than you started with. 
Three of our top contributors have identified three stocks that are popular with investors right now but could also be poisonous to own. This includes computer-chip designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), small-in-size (but big-in-risk) biotech Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX), and mortgage REIT giant Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NYSE:NLY). 
Our contributors explain why these stocks are worth avoiding. Image source: Getty Images.
If you've been considering one of these stocks for your portfolio, make sure you've studied them closely. They may be popular, but they might also be toxic. 
Anders Bylund (Advanced Micro Devices): AMD sure fits the bill if you're looking for a popular stock. The chip designer inspires impressive volumes of online forum discussions, and daily trading volumes are downright crazy for a moderately sized midcap stock. This would be great if AMD were a fresh-faced upstart or a solid turnaround story in the making, and investors just couldn't help to share a near-certain ticket to big gains before the rally runs out of gas.
Unfortunately, that's not what AMD is offering here.
AMD's rocket-like run could end badly for investors. Image source: Getty Images.
Share prices have risen more than fivefold over the last year. AMD is trading at price-to-sales ratios comparable to larger rival Intel, and a much richer price-to-book ratio. Again, this could make sense if AMD sported profit margins in Intel's class, or superior growth trends. But Intel remains a stoutly profitable pillar of the semiconductor industry while AMD's profit margins have been negative for years.
Yes, AMD is doing many things right for the first time since dropping former CEO Dirk Meyer like a bad habit. Current leader, Lisa Su, has righted the sinking ship to some degree and AMD is turning out competitive chips these days. One of these days, the company might even turn a profit.
But that's still more of a gamble than an investment thesis. And either way, share prices have shot up into nosebleed territory with little support from actual business results.
Priced for absolute perfection, AMD must now deliver on every bit of the promises its new Ryzen and Polaris chip architectures have been making. All it takes is one manufacturing misstep, one equally fantastic product launch from a major rival, or one mistake at the negotiating table with PC builders -- and then the gains of 2016 could evaporate in a hurry.
Cory Renauer (Novavax, Inc.): Although small-cap biotech stocks can inflate your portfolio overnight, they also have a tendency to let the air out. Sticking to companies taking multiple shots on goal is a great way to protect yourself. Unfortunately, Novavax's safety net is practically nonexistent. It isn't isn't running any clinical trials with new drug candidates other than a once-failed experimental respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.
For decades efforts to develop a vaccine to prevent RSV have come up short, and it remains a leading cause of hospitalizations for infants and older adults. The first effective vaccine could generate billions in annual revenue and send Novavax's stock soaring.
Image source: Getty Images.
Unfortunately, Novavax's RSV candidate already stumbled once. The market hammered the stock last year after the company announced miserable late-stage trial results. In a trial with thousands of older adults, it failed to reduce the rate of infection versus a placebo.
The company had already started another large trial with pregnant women to see if it will lower infection rates of newborn infants through their first year. Positive results could lift the stock, but in the meantime, the company is quickly depleting its cash reserves. It ended 2016 with $235.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, after burning through $255.5 million last year.
Raising more equity to pay the bills would dilute shareholder value in the near term. Further out, another failure in the maternal immunization could be devastating. As much as I'd love to see the company succeed, it seems letting this stock into your portfolio could prove highly toxic.
Jason Hall (Annaly Capital Management, Inc.): Annaly Capital is as well-run a company as you'll find, and its 12-month dividend yield of nearly 11% at recent stock prices makes it incredibly appealing, and popular for investors chasing income. 
However, because of the way the company makes a living, investors should think twice before making a big bet that the dividend will be dependable going forward. Annaly Capital makes money on the spread between what it pays for capital when it takes on debt and what it can collect in interest on the assets -- largely residential and commercial real estate debt it buys with the capital. And it's looking more and more as if we're moving from a decades-long period of falling interest rates, which had been great for Annaly's ability to grow earnings (and its dividend), to a cycle of flat-to-rising rates. 
Annaly could turn into a yield trap soon. Image source: Getty Images.
And where this could be a problem for Annaly and other REITs that focus on owning debt is that its cost of capital could increase more quickly than the rates it will be able to collect, narrowing the ""spread"" it gets and cutting profits. Frankly, that's a big reason its stock is yielding so much today -- the market seems to expect this will catch up to Annaly sooner or later, and the dividend will get cut. 
If that happens, many of those income-chasing investors will quickly flee the stock and send it falling, adding the injury of capital losses to the insult of a slashed dividend. So before you rush into this potential dividend opportunity, don't discount the risk that it really is too good to be true.

            ","After a long wait, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has finally launched the first batch of its Ryzen CPUs. AMD is starting at the high end, launching three Ryzen 7 products aimed at ending Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) dominance in an area where AMD has been largely absent for years. The Ryzen 7 1700, 1700X, and 1800X, priced between $329 and $499, represent a major achievement for the company.
Ryzen has exceeded my expectations, which were not particularly high due to AMD's long history of coming up short of its own promises. The company has largely delivered with Ryzen, and this moment truly represents a turning point. However, those hoping for huge market share gains may need to temper their expectations. While Ryzen is the clear winner in applications that can make full use of its eight cores, gaming is another story.
Image source: AMD.
All three Ryzen 7 processors feature eight cores, double the typical number for desktop processors. Intel does sell some desktop chips with more than four cores, but those are priced at almost comical levels given Ryzen's pricing. Intel was able to price these chips so high because it faced absolutely no competition. That ends with Ryzen.
The consensus from the independent third-party reviews of Ryzen is clear. In applications that scale well with the number of cores, AMD's new chips are a home run. Intel's expensive Broadwell-E chips also do well, but Ryzen offers far higher performance per dollar.
There are some workstation use cases where Ryzen performs badly despite the extra cores. Tom's Hardware ran a litany of tests where Intel's i7-7700k, a quad-core chip priced at $349, handily beats out the most expensive Ryzen chip. The site points out that many of the applications are specifically optimized and compiled for Intel CPUs, giving Intel a major edge. This will presumably change once developers optimize for Ryzen, but it may put a damper on demand in the meantime.
In tests where optimization isn't an issue, the 1800X blows the 7700k out of the water. For those who routinely use workstation and professional applications that scale well the core count and that aren't specifically optimized for Intel CPUs, Ryzen has disrupted the market in a big way.
While Ryzen's eight cores bring increased performance in cases where they can be fully utilized, single-threaded performance remains a problem. AMD's previous generation of chips, which began with Bulldozer in 2011, were awful compared to Intel in terms of single-threaded performance. Ryzen closes the gap significantly, but it still falls short of Intel's best.
Tom's Hardware concludes that it's hard to recommend the 1800X over Intel's cheaper quad-core chips for gaming. GamersNexus calls it a hard pass for gaming. These high-end Ryzen chips are by no means bad for gaming. But they simply can't match Intel's 7700k.
The problem is that PC games generally can't take full advantage of eight cores. Performance doesn't scale nearly as well with the core count compared to other types of applications, and that leaves Ryzen at a disadvantage. This varies game to game, and some games do a better job than others. But in general, single-threaded performance matters for gaming. And that's exactly where Ryzen falls short.
Even in CPU-intensive games like Ashes of the Singularity, Tom's Hardware has the 7700k easily beating the 1800X at both 1080p and 1440p resolutions. The benchmarks AMD provided were done at a 4K resolution, which showed a much smaller gap. But the bottleneck at 4K is the GPU, so the performance gap between Ryzen and the 7700k is less visible.
For those whose main use case is gaming, there appears to be little reason to opt for a Ryzen chip over Intel's 7700k. The equation changes if applications that benefit from more cores are thrown into the mix, but as a gaming chip Ryzen disappoints. This will work against AMD as it aims to gain market share from Intel.
Overall, Ryzen is an important accomplishment for AMD. AMD is in a vastly better position with Ryzen compared to its previous generation of chips, and market share gains are almost guaranteed. Lower-end Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 chips are coming in the second quarter and the second half, respectively, which will fill out AMD's lineup and make the company more competitive than it's been in quite some time.

            ","The PC gaming hardware market exceeded $30 billion in revenue in 2016, up nearly 22% from the previous year, according to Jon Peddie Research. This growth in gaming hardware was surprising, as the industry was not expected to cross the $30 billion threshold until 2018.
Both NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) took advantage of this opportunity by ramping up their sales. The shift of the gaming hardware market toward mid-range and high-end graphics cards, along with an increase in their average selling prices, was a key catalyst for both these companies.
Mid-range gaming systems, for example, had 35% market share last year, compared to 31% in 2015. Meanwhile, high-end systems accounted for 43% of the market, while entry-level systems dropped to 22%. NVIDIA and AMD each launched new GPUs to take advantage of the growth, but the latter's focus on the mid-range segment gave it significant headway.
AMD offered the best GPUs for gamers on a budget in 2016, as its cards delivered excellent performance. This led to an increase in its market share in discrete GPUs. The last available data from Jon Peddie Research indicates that AMD had 29.5% of the discrete GPU market at the end of 2016 with NVIDIA commanding the remainder. By comparison, NVIDIA had over 78% of the market just a year ago, but AMD clawed back substantial share during the period.
As the gaming hardware market will clock annual growth of 6% through 2019, this sets the stage for the rivalry between the two industry leaders to continue.
Following its gains in mid-range GPUs, AMD is now going after the high-end segment as well. The company will release its Polaris successor -- the Vega -- in the second quarter of 2017 in a bid to shake the dominance of NVIDIA's GTX 1080.
Image Source: AMD.
AMD is expected to pack more computing power in the Vega GPUs and to price them competitively against NVIDIA's offerings. It will also add the Instinct line of accelerators to Vega GPUs to trump NVIDIA in terms of compute power in applications beyond gaming, such as machine intelligence.
Leaked benchmarks from multiple sources indicate  that AMD's MI8 and MI25 GPU accelerators are going to help the Vega outperform NVIDIA's Titan X in machine intelligence applications. The leaks indicate that the Instinct MI25 accelerator is said to be twice as fast as the NVIDIA Pascal X in deep learning benchmarks and will go head-to-head against NVIDIA's next GPU -- the GTX 1080 Ti.
Digital Trends reported NVIDIA is likely to price the GTX 1080Ti at around $900, as compared to the GTX 1080's base price of $600 and the Titan X's $1,200. On the other hand, the top of the line AMD Vega GPU is expected to come in at $800 to $1,200, while the competing GTX 1080 Ti should fall around $700. Strategic pricing will be critical to AMD's success in the high-end GPU space.
NVIDIA will fight back with its next-generation Volta architecture. Rumors suggest that NVIDIA's Pascal successor is expected to come out toward the end of 2017 or in early 2018.
Image Source: NVIDIA.
Though the specs of these Volta cards are not yet available, the company is reportedly going to employ Taiwan Semiconductor as its manufacturing partner, using a more efficient manufacturing process. The Volta should be based on a leaner 12 nanometer node versus the AMD Vega's 14 nanometer.
Theoretically, a smaller die shrink should deliver performance gains. GlobalFoundries, for instance, estimates that its 12nm process delivers 15% performance gains and consumes 50% less power than the 16nm process. NVIDIA will want to solidly outperform the Vega with its next-generation offerings.
But until the Volta hits shelves, AMD will have the opportunity to continue grabbing market share, extending the company's strong momentum from 2016.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is giving both NVIDIA and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) a run for their money, as the latest market share numbers for graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) indicate. Jon Peddie Research shows that AMD's overall GPU market share -- including both discrete and embedded graphics -- increased to 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. That is a gain of 2.6 percentage points from the prior-year period, outpacing both its peers.
Intel, meanwhile, saw its share decline 3.6 percentage points to 68.1% as consumers appear to gravitate towards powerful discrete GPUs over integrated units. The bad news for the market leader: Intel is not losing market share only in graphics processors.
Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
Mercury Research points out that AMD also gained on Intel in the CPU market. Its x86 processor market share increased to 13.6% from 12.7% in 2015. On the other hand, Intel saw its market share fall accordingly to 86.3%.
In 2017, both Intel and AMD will duke it out with new CPU products -- will the underdog be able to gain on Intel once again?
AMD has devised a broad strategy of tapping both the high-end and budget markets for growth. While its latest and greatest Ryzen architecture has been designed to compete in the high end segment, AMD has decided to consolidate its lower-priced offerings to meet demand from users on a budget, according to Mercury Research.
As it turns out, most PC growth until 2020 will take place in emerging markets. IDC predicts that they will account for 54.3% of PC market share in 2020, compared to 51.2% last year. Currently, the GDP per capita in most emerging markets is under $10,000, including the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China), so having budget offerings is a smart move for AMD.
According to Forbes contributor Antony Leather, AMD's baseline 4-core CPU -- the Ryzen 3 1100 -- will cost $129. By comparison, Intel's entry-level Core i3-7100 Kaby Lake processor, launched this year, is selling for just under $120 at many online retailers though its specs are not quite as strong with two fewer cores.
Competing at essentially the same price point, AMD is hoping to win over budget-minded consumers, giving it a leg up in this segment of the market.
Though Intel has already launched its Kaby Lake processors, its top-of-the-line Core i7-7700K is expected to sport weaker specs than AMD's flagship Ryzen 7 1800X processor.
In response, Intel is rumored to be launching its Kaby Lake-X Core i7-7740K processor in August this year. However, it will be late to the market with something that truly competes against the flagship Ryzen, which AMD is launching this month, giving it about six months to rack up sales before Intel can respond.
Additionally, rumors on Taiwanese site BenchLife indicate that to tap the premium market, Intel might come out with a 10-core high-end processor that could sell for as much as $1,700. Details are sparse, but such a price point generally indicates that Intel would eclipse AMD's own top-of-the-line processor (expected to retail for $499).
The gaming hardware market is expected to grow 6% annually through 2019, and the majority of that growth will take place in the high-end segment where AMD will be able to enjoy a running start. 
With these impressive releases offered at competitive prices, it won't be surprising if AMD manages to steal additional market share from Intel in 2017.

            ","Unless you closely follow the stock, you probably had no idea shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are up a gaudy 620% since March 2016 in the last 12 months. That is not a typo. 


AMD data by YCharts.
The ongoing rally in AMD shares has been perhaps one of the least discussed but most impressive investing storylines in tech in the past year. In fact, AMD's share-price surge is about three times larger than the incredible run in NVIDIA stock over the last year. So what's driving this wild, newfound bullishness in AMD stock? Let's take a look.
AMD's business has enjoyed something of a turnaround in recent quarters. After seeing sales fall for seven consecutive quarters, AMD has produced positive sales growth in each of its three most recent quarters. Investors anticipate company-specific and industrywide trends will allow AMD to expand its business presence in each of its two core operating segments in the years to come.
On the gaming side of its business,   Microsoft and Sony will each refresh their respective consoles in the coming years to enable next-generation graphic capabilities like 4K video quality and virtual reality (VR) gaming. AMD is the main supplier of semi-customer system-on-a-chip (SOC) for both Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's Playstation gaming consoles; Sony and Microsoft each consistently account for more than 10% of AMD's annual sales. 

. Microsoft has already announced its latest Xbox iteration, dubbed Project Scorpio, which will arrive in time for the 2017 holiday season. Sony has yet to announce its response to Scorpio, but major console releases tend to closely follow one another. Many industry observers believe this new upgrade cycle will create a corresponding surge in new revenue for AMD that will help extend its current sales growth momentum.
In its computing and graphics unit, AMD should enjoy an opportunity to catch up with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in CPUs and NVIDIA in GPUs to a certain extent. AMD's forthcoming 14 nm Ryzen CPUs, due to launch by March, offer more powerful performance than Intel's i7 chips. Similarly, AMD's Vega chips appear to be a legitimate challenger to NVIDIA's GeForce high-end gaming GPUs. So there's certainly a fair case to be made that sales  will indeed improve at AMD in the coming year.
All of this is to say that things are generally looking up at AMD. At the same time though, a few important points cause me to question whether its rally can continue.
Image source: Getty Images.
Though business conditions are indeed improving at AMD, it isn't as clear that this longtime ugly duckling has permanently transformed into a swan, for a few reasons.
A key piece of AMD's bull thesis is that its current 14 nm Zen server chips have closed the gap with Intel's 14 nm Broadwell server microprocessors this year, largely the result of Intel's decision to not shift its CPUs to a 10 nm die shrink, codenamed Cannonlake, until the second half of 2017. Bullish analysts see AMD catching Intel at the 14 nm level as creating a window for it to steal server market share from Intel, which indeed seems plausible. However, with Intel moving to 10 nm by the latter half of this year, AMD's parity with Intel server chips seems likely to be short-lived, making this large market-share gain difficult to sustain.
Equally important, it isn't necessarily clear whether meaningful sales growth will translate into actual profits for AMD and its investors. Though the company has gone through two separate cost-structure overhauls, in 2014 and 2015, its margin structure has continued to deteriorate. For example, its gross margins fell from 27% in 2015 to 23% in 2016, even as it saw its revenue increase 12%. This suggests AMD's business model lacks the kind of operating leverage that could allow it to quickly return to profitability if sales continue to rise.
In a nutshell, ongoing success is by no means assured at AMD. The company has done an admirable job capitalizing on its various opportunities in recent years. However, as we saw above, several structural reasons exist that may make it difficult to sustain this kind of success over the long term.

            ","Monday started the new week on a positive note, as the stock market once again recovered from early declines to post advances. The Dow Jones Industrials extended its string of record closes to 12 consecutive days in the wake of favorable comments from Warren Buffett about the valuation of the market. Moves within the Trump administration to transfer spending to the Defense Department also bolstered the overall market mood. In addition, good news from certain companies helped to sustain positive sentiment overall, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Windstream Holdings (NASDAQ:WIN), and Gogo (NASDAQ:GOGO) were among the top performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.  
Advanced Micro Devices' stock picked up 8%, reaching levels it hasn't seen in nearly a decade. Early reports of pre-order activity for AMD's new Ryzen central processing unit suggest it has been extremely strong, with some retailers having sold out of their allocations. The most powerful Ryzen 7 chip will be on sale starting this week, while slightly less powerful Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 models will get released over the course of 2017. Investors are growing increasingly confident that AMD can successfully compete against rival chipmaker Intel with Ryzen, and AMD's Polaris graphics products could also make the company more competitive against its key graphics rivals. With other chip offerings expected in 2017, investors believe that AMD CEO Lisa Su and her team of executives are making a difference and returning Advanced Micro Devices to relevance in the semiconductor industry.

Windstream Holdings' shares climbed 8% after the company announced that it had completed its merger with EarthLink. The combination should produce more than $150 million in savings every year from operating and capital expenses, because the two companies should be able to share operations and get economies of scale within the first three years after the merger. That's $25 million more in annual savings than the company originally expected, but CEO Tony Thomas said that the bigger impact will be on the two companies' customers, who ""will benefit from our expanded national fiber footprint and enhanced products and services, including [software-defined wide area networks], [unified communications as a service], network security, managed services, and cloud connectivity."" EarthLink will have three directors on Windstream's 12-person board, and the combined company anticipates plenty of benefits going forward.
Finally, shares of Gogo gained 15%. The provider of in-flight internet services reported its fourth-quarter financial results Monday morning, which included a 16% rise in revenue and a narrower net loss than in the year-earlier quarter. CEO Michael Small said that Gogo's 2Ku service offering ""demonstrates industry-leading speed, coverage, and service availability,"" and Gogo has been adding new installations quickly enough that it now expects to post positive free cash flow by 2019, a year earlier than previously expected. Even in the short term, revenue growth of 12% to 17% in 2017 and adjusted pre-tax operating earnings of $60 million to $75 million were promising. Investors hope that Gogo can keep gaining altitude despite rising competition from satellite and other providers, and for now, those hopes appear to be panning out.

            ","
In a startling turn of events, institutional broker Rosenblatt Securities announced this morning that it is recommending its clients sell Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock, and buy Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) instead.
And that's not all. Announcing a whole slew of new stock ""initiations,"" Rosenblatt urged investors this morning to buy graphics star NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), flash memory specialist Micron, and semiconductor maker Broadcom, but leave chipmaker Cavium Networks on the shelf. With so many new recommendations to choose from, we're going to limit ourselves today to just a choice handful.
Here are three things you need to know about them.
Image source: Getty Images.
After basking ""in the glory days of Moore's"" Law for years, Rosenblatt fears that the world has turned more ""data centric."" As explained in a write-up on StreetInsider.com today, Rosenblatt concedes that Intel has enjoyed a ""near 100% share"" of the market for x86 server CPUs. What the analyst worries about, though, is that the market today is tilting toward graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators, markets where Intel is less dominant.
Accordingly, when Rosenblatt initiated coverage of Intel this morning, it did so with a sell rating.
Incidentally, when you think GPUs, two names naturally spring to mind: NVIDIA and its archrival in graphics, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). It should come as no surprise, therefore, that at the same time as Rosenblatt warns against buying Intel, it's urging investors to buy AMD and NVIDIA instead.
According to the analyst, Intel's losses in x86 will be AMD's gain, as the latter enjoys the ""potential"" for ""share gain"" in ""x86 server/datacenter"" CPUs, and benefits, too, from a market that will favor makers of GPUs for ""next generation computing."" Similarly, Rosenblatt likes NVIDIA, a stock that the analyst expects to benefit from ""secular sustainability in the company's core gaming business,"" accelerated by ""[virtual reality/augmented reality] and eSports as tailwinds."" And on top of all that, Rosenblatt sees NVIDIA enjoying ""multi-billion dollar green field opportunities (AI, self-driving cars, etc.), combined with the company's unique set of scalable core IP/Software/technologies in GPGPU, deep neural network compute, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving.""
When all's said and done, Rosenblatt sees AMD stock gaining 17% as it rises to $16.50 a share over the next year, and NVIDIA surging ahead 26% in the same time frame. Needless to say, Rosenblatt recommends buying them both.
Veering away from the great Intel-AMD debate, though, Rosenblatt's most surprising call of the day is a recommendation to buy shares of Texas Instruments. Initiating with a buy rating and a 12-month price target of $90 a share, Rosenblatt is looking for 17% gain in stock price from Texas Instruments. That's about equal to the 17% expected gain from AMD stock, but less than the 26% profit Rosenblatt hopes to see from NVIDIA.
So why does Rosenblatt love TI? (And why might you?)
The answer goes beyond servers, to focus on Texas Instruments' ""dominant position in the analog industry,"" where Rosenblatt says it enjoys a ""high-teens market share"" of this $45 billion market. Furthermore, TI is making ""consistent share gains,"" enjoys a ""structural manufacturing cost advantage,"" and is producing ""sustainable FCF generation"" that makes the stock ideal for ""long term and income oriented investment.""
According to Rosenblatt, Texas Instruments is using its ""long-term structural manufacturing cost advantage [in] 300mm wafers"" to deliver ""20%- 30% FCF"" margins for shareholders. And Rosenblatt is right.
According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Texas Instruments generated positive free cash flow of $4.1 billion on $13.4 billion in revenue last year -- better than a 30% free cash flow margin, and even better than the company's net profit margin of 26.9% (on $3.6 billion in GAAP profits). What's more, ""FCF generation is all that matters at TI,"" exults Rosenblatt, and TI management aims to reward shareholders by returning literally all of its free cash (minus net debt retirement) to shareholders through a combination of payouts of its 2.6% dividend yield and stock repurchases (1.5% shares retired over the past year).
When you add those two numbers (4.1%) to analysts' projected growth rate (10%), what you get is about a 14.1% projected return to shareholders owning Texas Instruments stock -- not far short of TI's price-to-free cash flow ratio of 18.8.
Personally, I still don't think paying 18.8 times FCF for a 14% return is quite cheap enough to make TI a bargain, but apparently Rosenblatt believes it's close enough to justify a buy rating.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) recently surged after the chipmaker posted strong fourth quarter numbers, topped off with solid guidance. Revenue rose 16% annually to $1.11 billion, beating estimates by $40 million. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.01 topped expectations by a penny, and represented a major improvement from its loss of $0.10 per share in the year ago quarter. For the first quarter, AMD expects revenue to rise 18% annually -- crushing analyst estimates for 2% growth.
Image source: AMD.
Those numbers look solid, but investors looking at AMD's 460% rally over the past 12 months might be wondering if most of that good news is already priced in. Let's take a closer look at AMD's recovery, and see if it's sensible to buy AMD at its highest price in over eight years.
AMD's quarterly revenue has risen annually for three straight quarters, marking a remarkable rebound from seven straight quarters of declines. Much of that growth was fueled by the EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which produces SoCs for non-PC products like Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. 
That demand is expected to rise this year as both companies launch upgraded consoles for 4K and VR gaming. Revenue from the EESC business rose 4% annually to $506 million last quarter, but operating income fell 20% to $47 million due to higher R&D investments. In the past, the strength of the EESC business offset the relative weakness of the Computing and Graphics unit, which produces x86 CPUs and GPUs. Both product lines have traditionally struggled against Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. 
But last quarter, AMD's Computing and Graphics revenue rose 28% annually to $600 million on robust sales of its new Polaris-based RX 400 series GPUs. At the time of its launch, the $200 RX 480 was the cheapest VR-capable card on the market -- making it possible to build Rift and Vive-ready desktops for under $1,000. The unit's operating loss of $21 million was also an improvement from its loss of $99 million a year earlier.
The RX 480. Image source: AMD.
Looking ahead, many AMD bulls believe that rising sales of PC and console-based VR headsets can simultaneously lift sales of its custom SoCs and discrete GPUs this year. They also expect AMD's next-gen CPU, Ryzen, to outperform Intel's top-tier i7 processors when they arrive in March, and that its high-end Vega GPUs will outperform NVIDIA's premium tier of Pascal-powered GeForce GPUs. If the Ryzen and Vega chips can achieve those lofty goals, AMD's Computing and Graphics unit could become the company's core growth engine again. 
AMD could also benefit from the upcoming expiration of a graphics cross-licensing deal between Intel and NVIDIA. Intel hasn't been keen on renewing that agreement, which boosts NVIDIA's revenue by $66 million per quarter, and rumors suggest that Intel could sign a comparable licensing deal with AMD instead. 
AMD also narrowed its losses, reduced its debt, and boosted its cash position in fiscal 2016. Those achievements all counter the bearish argument that AMD's losses will widen, causing it to collapse under its debt load as its cash flows dry up. Lastly, AMD stock remains fundamentally cheap after its massive rally in 2016. It trades with an EV/Sales ratio of 2.8, which is lower than Intel's ratio of 3.1 and NVIDIA's ratio of 9.4. That valuation -- along with its enterprise value of $11.6 billion -- make it a potential buyout or merger target for larger chipmakers.
Those potential catalysts all sound encouraging, but there are also reasons to avoid AMD. First, console sales could stall if consumer demand for 4K and VR games is weaker than expected. Early sales estimates for VR headsets suggest that demand for smartphone and console-based headsets is outweighing demand for PC-based ones. 
While that could boost AMD's EESC business, it could throttle demand for its VR-ready GPUs. Meanwhile, Nintendo's upcoming launch of the Switch, which is powered by an NVIDIA's Tegra X1 SoC, could also disrupt Sony and Microsoft's console sales as the original Wii did a decade ago. 
Lastly, too much of AMD's future relies on the Ryzen challenging Intel's CPUs and the Vega GPU countering NVIDIA's. While the Ryzen might beat Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors, there's no guarantee that it can topple Intel's 10nm Cannonlake processors, which will launch in late 2017. Likewise, the Vega might beat NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal GPUs, but it could be crushed by NVIDIA's next-gen Volta, which is also expected to launch this year. This means that the Ryzen and Vega could respectively become top-tier CPUs and GPUs this year, but those victories might be short lived. 
I believe that investors with a higher tolerance for risk could start partial positions in AMD at current prices. But I also believe that the chipmaker's future growth depends on it bowling a near-perfect game this year -- which could be very tough as Intel and NVIDIA launch their new competing chips.

            ","Many chipmakers posted strong numbers over the past year, thanks to rising demand for semiconductors across multiple industries. Two standout names from that sector are AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) -- which respectively rallied about 460% and 50% over the past 12 months. Let's take a closer look at both chipmakers, and see if either stock is still worth buying after those big rallies.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD is the world's second largest maker of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs. But over the past decade, Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs have greatly reduced AMD's share of both markets. To diversify away from those two markets, AMD invested heavily in Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) chips for other devices like gaming consoles. It also launched low-end ""VR ready"" GPUs to tap into the growing demand for PC-based VR games.
Cypress makes programmable semiconductors for the automotive, industrial, home automation, medical devices, and consumer electronics markets. It's been expanding aggressively over the past two years, by first merging with embedded chipmaker Spansion in a $5 billion deal in 2015, and then acquiring Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) Internet of Things (IoT) business for $550 million in 2016. Those moves made it a major player in the growing IoT market.
After falling year-over-year for seven straight quarters, AMD's revenues rose in the past three quarters, thanks to robust demand for the PS4 and Xbox One supporting its EESC business, and strong sales of its new Polaris-based GPUs bolstering the Computing and Graphics business. AMD's total revenue rose 16% annually to $1.11 billion last quarter, fueled by 4% growth in EESC revenues and 28% growth in Computing and Graphics revenues. For the current quarter, AMD expects its revenue to rise 18% annually at the midpoint -- which easily tops analysts' estimates for 2% growth.
Cypress' quarterly revenues have risen annually for nine straight quarters, but some of that growth was inflated by its aforementioned acquisitions. Cypress' revenue rose 16% annually to $530 million last quarter, thanks to the Broadcom acquisition boosting its microcontroller and connectivity division (MCD) revenues, and robust sales growth in China and Japan. For the current quarter, Cypress expects its revenues to rise 20% annually at the midpoint -- which also beats the consensus estimate of 17% growth.
AMD has enjoyed a nice lift from sales of consoles and low-end gaming GPUs over the past year, but the competition is expected to intensify this year as NVIDIA launches its next-gen Volta GPUs and Intel introduces its next-gen 10nm Cannonlake CPUs. AMD is meeting that competition head-on with its high-end Vega GPUs and Ryzen CPUs. Early data indicates that the Vega and Ryzen chips might respectively outperform NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal and Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake chips, but it's unclear how they'll fare against Volta and Cannonlake. 
Another issue with AMD is its dependence on console sales. The bulls believe that the recent PS4 and Xbox One upgrades for 4K and VR gaming can rejuvenate console sales this year, but the bears believe that those new features might not persuade consumers to buy new hardware.

Cypress is well-poised to benefit from the growing demand for connected and programmable chips in the automotive and industrial sectors. Those two high-growth markets accounted for 55% of Cypress' revenue in 2016, compared to just 30% in 2011. The Broadcom acquisition also boosted its content share per connected car by 26%, and is helping Cypress address the wired, wireless, memory, and data storage needs of the broader IoT market. But looking ahead, a key challenge for Cypress will be staying competitive against bigger rivals like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), which targets many of the same markets.
Neither AMD nor Cypress is profitable on a GAAP basis. AMD reported a GAAP loss of $497 million in fiscal 2016, but that represented an improvement from its loss of $660 million in 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, AMD's net loss narrowed from $419 million to $117 million. 
Cypress reported a GAAP loss of $686 million in fiscal 2016, which was much wider than its loss of $379 million in 2015, due to the rising costs of its inorganic growth strategy. But on a non-GAAP basis, its net income rose 142% to $170 million. Analysts currently believe that AMD can return to non-GAAP profitability this year, and expect Cypress' non-GAAP earnings to grow 41% this year.
AMD currently has an EV/Sales ratio of 2.7, which is lower than Intel's ratio of 3.1 and NVIDIA's ratio of 9.4. Cypress also has an EV/Sales ratio of 2.7, which compares favorably to Texas Instruments' ratio of 5.7. That makes both stocks fairly cheap relative to their industry peers.
I see solid reasons for buying both AMD and Cypress, but AMD's future relies too heavily on Ryzen and Vega's ability to counter Cannonlake and Volta. If those plans don't work out, AMD stock could quickly lose its footing.
Cypress has a better-diversified business, and its growth this year isn't heavily dependent on outmaneuvering bigger competitors. Cypress also pays a forward dividend yield of 3.7%, while AMD doesn't pay one at all. Therefore, the choice between the two is pretty clear -- Cypress is a much safer play than AMD at current prices.

            ","Popular stocks are expensive. An expensive stock can certainly produce market-beating returns if the underlying company performs well, but missing expectations can send the stock tumbling. Here's why Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) could devastate your portfolio.
Rich Duprey (Twitter): Shares of Twitter are up 34% over their recent lows and are 10% higher in 2017 so far, but the problems are legion with the short-form social media platform, and investors would be wise to avoid it.
Twitter user growth has largely stalled causing revenues to flag, as well. Advertisers are seemingly becoming leery about the value of the service as revenues from that avenue rose just 6% last quarter. In fact, the whole operation looks as though it's seizing up, as growth across any metric is, by and large, in the single digits -- hardly the kind of results you'd expect out of a tech company.

But there are deeper problems, too, considering Twitter generates some $2.5 billion in revenues annually, which isn't all that shabby. But generating those revenues is apparently a very expensive business -- some $1.2 billion, or almost half its sales. And last quarter, the company announced that it needed to restructure its operations, which meant firing 9% of its workforce.
Of course, there are also the usual complaints about the online bullying that occurs on the social media platform, in addition to the rabid flash-mob attacks that can instantly appear if you fall on the wrong side of the issue. And Twitter is having a growing credibility problem as more and more of its accounts are found to be operated by bots.
According to recent research, there could be a network of almost 1 million bots controlling accounts on the site. While Twitter actively tries to monitor and prevent such accounts from existing, it points to some underlying problems that may create unease with its value.
Earnings are due out very soon, so we'll get to see in which direction Twitter is headed, but there's no reason to think it's about to reverse course now, and will likely only reveal a further deceleration in its growth path.
Tim Green (Advanced Micro Devices): Shares of AMD quadrupled in 2016 as investors bought into the story that new products would return the company to its former glory. Ryzen, AMD's highly anticipated PC CPU, will be arriving in early March. Vega, a high-end GPU gunning for NVIDIA, is expected to be available sometime during the second quarter.
The rally in AMD shares has so far been based mainly on hope. The company is still losing money, and its revenue is far below peak levels. Both Ryzen and Vega have a lot of potential, and AMD's deal with Google to put its server GPUs in the cloud is a good first step in catching up with NVIDIA in that area. But now, AMD needs to deliver.
AMD's market capitalization has reached about $12.3 billion, up from less than $2 billion at the beginning of 2016. In AMD's best year in the past decade, 2011, it earned $491 million of net income. AMD stock trades for 25 times that peak number, despite the company losing money in each of the past five years.
Ryzen and Vega, both high-end products, can certainly drive AMD's margins higher. But the market is pricing in something close to the best-case scenario. Absolutely everything must go right for AMD. Anything short of that could spell disaster.
Beth McKenna (Mattel): A popular stock -- especially among income investors -- that could prove toxic to investors' portfolios is toymaker Mattel, best known for making the iconic fashion doll, Barbie. Some of its other well-known brands are Fisher-Price, Match Box, Hot Wheels, and American Girl. 
Mattel stock's long-term trajectory was solidly up through 2013. Declining Barbie sales then resulted in the stock dropping through late 2015. The company's turnaround efforts started showing signs of success beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. Coupled with Mattel's generous dividend, these signs caused many investors to dive in, pushing the stock up considerably from its trough in 2015 into 2016.
The dividend recently got juicier -- but not for a good reason -- and is now yielding 5.9%. This increase was due to the stock's nearly 18% plunge in late January after Mattel reported weak fourth-quarter 2016 earnings.

Prime rival Hasbro has been significantly outperforming Mattel on both the business and stock-performance fronts. Data by YCharts.
The fourth quarter is critical for toy retailers because it includes the holiday period. Mattel's net sales declined 8% as reported, and 6% in constant currency, while adjusted earnings per share dropped 20%. Excluding sales from Disney Princess and Frozen -- Mattel lost this lucrative doll license to Hasbro in 2016 -- gross sales were flat as reported, and up in the mid-single digits in constant currency. So Mattel has done a nice job in closing the revenue gap created by the lost Disney license.
However, two metrics were quite concerning and point to continued struggles ahead. First, Barbie sales declined 2%, as reported, and were up 1% in constant currency. Increasing Barbie sales is the cornerstone of Mattel's turnaround plan -- and these metrics suggest the turnaround has stalled. Second, the company's decent showing on the revenue front came at a price: Gross margin decreased 320 basis points, driven mainly by increased discounting, as well as currency headwinds.
As to that fat dividend, it's not infinitely sustainable. Mattel's trailing-12-month cash dividend payout ratio (dividends paid/free cash flow) has exceeded 100% throughout 2016. This means it's paying out more in dividends than it's generating in free cash flow.
One caveat to my opinion that Mattel stock could prove toxic -- the stock could get a lift if market chatter about a merger between Mattel and Hasbro comes to fruition. But investors shouldn't buy the stock of a company based solely on merger and acquisition rumors.

            ","After years of slumping market share and lackluster performance, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will re-enter the high-end CPU and GPU markets this year with Ryzen and Vega. Ryzen, the company's new CPU, aims to go toe-to-toe with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), while Vega, its new GPU, looks to chip away at NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance.
AMD reported its fourth-quarter results in January, concluding its fifth consecutive year of losses. The situation could improve dramatically this year if Ryzen and Vega drive market share gains, something the market is already pricing in. During AMD's quarterly conference call, CEO Lisa Su provided some additional details on the company's results and outlook. Here are four quotes from Su, taken from the transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.
Image source: AMD.
AMD launched its Polaris line of mainstream graphics cards in mid-2016. The RX 480 came first, priced at $239 to $199 depending on the amount of memory, followed by the lower-end RX 470 and RX 460. Revenue in AMD's computing and graphics segment jumped 28% year over year during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by Polaris.
In graphics, strong sales increases across all of our product lines drove a double-digit increase in GPU processor revenue from a year ago. Desktop GPU shipments and revenue increased by double-digit percentages from a year ago based on growing OEM and channel adoption of Polaris GPU's. Polaris processor sales were particularly strong in the performance and enthusiast portions of the market, resulting in our highest channel GPU sales in more than two years.
The company's unit market share was near its bottom, around 20%, during the fourth quarter of 2015, so it's an easy comparison. Among gamers, Polaris has been nowhere near as successful as NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards. Steam's hardware and software survey puts NVIDIA's GTX 1060 at more than four times the popularity of the RX 480. So while Polaris is driving growth and gaining some momentum, it's far from a runaway success.
Software is one area where NVIDIA has built up an advantage over the past few years. On the gaming side, NVIDIA's GeForce experience gives gamers a slew of features like per-game optimization and built in live-streaming. GameWorks, NVIDIA's library of software for game developers, allows developers to implement advanced visual features optimized specifically for NVIDIA hardware.
On the compute side, the list of software ported to run on NVIDIA's GPUs is long, ranging from computational finance to molecular dynamics simulations. This advantage will be tough to overcome, but AMD is pushing on that front.
We continue to invest in software, and our approach to software is really around open source and using the ecosystem and using the community and focused on the new APIs. So in gaming, we are very focused on DX12 and Vulcan. And on the professional graphics and on the GPU server side, really using our GPUOpen. So we will continue to invest in software; no question that that is really critical for the graphics market. But we feel we are making good progress.
Ryzen is set to become available in early March for PCs, but new server processors will be coming a bit later. Naples is AMD's new server CPU based on the Zen architecture, expected to launch during the second quarter. The strategy will be to go after the broader server CPU market, not just cloud computing.
The great thing about Naples is it really is a general-purpose product, so we will play in all of those segments. I think the cloud tends to move a bit faster in terms of just, again, from design win to revenue. So we certainly are very focused in the cloud, but I'm also quite enthusiastic about our opportunities in traditional enterprise as well as some of the storage and networking spaces.
Intel currently has a near-monopoly in the server CPU market, so AMD will be facing an uphill battle to say the least. But the server CPU market is essentially all upside for the company, since it has little presence today. If AMD can claw back a little market share from Intel, it would help drive the company back to profitability.
AMD no longer manufactures its own chips, but Su is confident that the company's roadmap will be competitive.
From our standpoint, process technology, we ramped 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer really well last year and into this year. We are actually in the process of developing now in 7-nanometer and we think the 7-nanometer foundry roadmaps are available, are very competitive, and will ensure that we have a strong multigenerational roadmap.
Intel has had plenty of trouble lately, abandoning its tick-tock strategy by inserting a third 14-nanometer chip into its roadmap. Intel's 10-nanometer chips are expected to come later this year, but the manufacturing gap between Intel and AMD will narrow substantially upon the launch of Ryzen. That's certainly good news for AMD.

            ","Wall Street didn't have a celebration on Monday, with major market benchmarks easing lower on what turned out to be a fairly quiet day in the stock market. Ongoing nervousness about tension related to new U.S. government policies weighed on some investors' minds, and a drop in the oil market also contributed to declines of 19 points for the Dow Jones Industrials and roughly five points for the S&P 500. Yet some stocks enjoyed better news, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), and First Majestic Silver (NYSE:AG) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Advanced Micro Devices climbed 11% after getting a favorable write-up in the weekly issue of Barron's over the weekend. The publication said that the chipmaker is fighting back against its main rivals in the microprocessor and graphics processing unit markets, and it therefore thinks that the company's stock could double from current levels despite already having produced impressive returns for shareholders over the past year. AMD has disappointed investors before with turnaround stories, but CEO Lisa Su is arguably in a better position to chart a successful course than some of her predecessors at the long-beleaguered semiconductor company. Given how low it went, even incremental progress could keep lifting AMD stock throughout 2017.

Cabot Oil & Gas climbed in the wake of its getting good news from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FERC approved Williams Companies' Atlantic Sunrise pipeline, which Cabot intends to use heavily in order to transport energy production from its holdings in the Marcellus shale region. Stock analysts also cited the FERC decision in upgrading the stock, but the more important issue is that the prospect for greater infrastructure for transporting oil and natural gas from the Marcellus and other underserved regions of the country could in the long run boost the prospects of not only Cabot but also similarly placed small oil and gas exploration and production companies. Moreover, if energy prices keep climbing, then demand for newly transportable energy could stay strong indefinitely.
Finally, First Majestic Silver gained 7%. Precious metals had a generally solid day, with gold rising $15 per ounce to $1,235, and silver gaining more than 1% as well. Silver prices are already up more than 10% so far in 2017, and First Majestic in particular made aggressive moves in order to accelerate future growth to take advantage of a rebound in silver over the course of the past year. By spending capital on improvements and rehabilitation projects, First Majestic hopes to grow its production from around 11 million to 12 million silver ounces currently to as much as 20 million ounces in the next three to five years. That's a tall order, but First Majestic's assets are attractive, and continued strength in the silver market would make the job even easier for the miner going forward.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped on Monday in an apparent reaction to a bullish article that appeared on Barron's over the weekend. At 2:30 p.m. EST, the stock was up about 10.5%.
The Barron's article argues that shares of AMD, which quadrupled last year, could double this year as the company launches new GPUs and CPUs that aim to challenge both NVIDIA and Intel. Ryzen, AMD's upcoming CPU, is set for an early March launch, while Vega, its high-end GPU, will be out sometime during the second quarter.
The article argues that AMD is now a more focused and streamlined company under CEO Lisa Su, one that won't repeat past mistakes. AMD was a major force in the PC CPU market in 2006, but its market share has collapsed since then following a series of missteps. Intel has been able to run away with the high end of the market as a result.
Image source: AMD.
On the GPU side, NVIDIA has spent the past few years consolidating its lead. AMD has shown some progress with Polaris, its mainstream line of graphics cards launched last year, but the real test will be the high-end Vega. But its competitor owns the high end, and it won't take kindly to AMD's attempted intrusions.
NVIDIA has found great success selling its GPUs into enterprise markets as accelerator cards, and the article argues that this presents an opportunity for AMD as well. Late last year, Alphabet's Google announced that it was installing AMD's GPUs into its cloud platform along with its competitor's, a big cloud win that AMD now needs to repeat with the other major cloud computing vendors.
The article ends in an optimistic tone: ""Supplying a brand-new market like cloud computing, where the rules are still being written, gives AMD an opportunity that lies well beyond being a second banana to Intel and Nvidia. It could even make AMD a much more strategic company with an importance all its own.""
AMD still posted a loss in 2016, and its revenue is well below peak levels. Ryzen and Vega will need to do well in order to justify the current stock price, let alone another 100% increase. In the absolute best-case scenario, where both Ryzen and Vega are smash hits and AMD makes up some serious ground in the data center, a doubling of the stock price could make sense. But that seems like a long shot to me, especially given AMD's long history of disappointing investors.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) ended 2016 on a high note. The company beat analyst estimates across the board when it reported its fourth-quarter results, driven mostly by its Polaris graphics cards. The PC CPU market also treated AMD a little better, with client processor sales improving compared to the third quarter.
AMD enters 2017 on the cusp of launching what CEO Lisa Su calls ""our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade."" Ryzen, the company's new CPU, is now confirmed to be launching in early March, while Vega, its upcoming high-end GPU, is set to launch sometime during the second quarter.
AMD is also in a far better financial position thanks to a joint venture deal and the sale of stock and convertible notes last year. The company had $1.26 billion in cash and $1.44 billion of debt at the end of 2016, compared to $785 million in cash and $2.24 billion in debt at the end of 2015. The diluted share count has jumped 17.7%, but that's a small price to pay for a sound balance sheet.
Despite beating estimates, AMD still posted a loss during the fourth quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Revenue jumped 15% year over year, but seasonally low sales of semi-custom products knocked sales down 15% compared to the third quarter. AMD managed a non-GAAP operating profit, but non-GAAP EPS still came in at a loss of $0.01. GAAP EPS was a larger loss of $0.06.
The computing and graphics segment, which includes GPUs and CPUs, produced $600 million of revenue, up 27.7% year over year and up 27.1% sequentially. AMD's Polaris graphics cards seem to be gaining some momentum, as they drove far less impressive growth during the third quarter. The segment posted an operating loss of $21 million, a major improvement over the $99 million loss reported during the fourth quarter of 2015.
The semi-custom segment grew revenue by 3.7% year over year to $506 million. Revenue sank 39% year over year, but this was expected. The third quarter features the buildup of game console inventory for the holiday season, and with the segment still dominated by game console SoCs, there's no way to avoid this seasonality. Segment operating income was $47 million, down 20% year over year despite the higher revenue.
AMD expects its first-quarter revenue to grow by 18% year over year, representing an 11% sequential decline. The company didn't provide earnings guidance for the quarter, but it did provide a more general outlook for 2017. AMD expects revenue to grow this year, with non-GAAP gross margin improving and non-GAAP net income turning positive. With both Ryzen and Vega launching soon, these goals aren't particularly optimistic.
Whether AMD's bottom line surges enough to justify the buoyant stock price is another matter. AMD's stock soared in 2016, and the company now has a market capitalization of around $10 billion. AMD will likely need to get its operating margin into the double-digits for that price to make much sense, a tall order for a company that has lost money in each of the past five years.
There's still plenty we don't know about Ryzen and Vega. Su talked about Ryzen during the conference call, but there wasn't much new information. The initial launch will be focused on the high end, competing with Intel's i7 and i5 chips, with the lineup eventually filled out with lower-end products. The breadth of the initial launch is still an unknown, as is pricing. Even less is known about Vega.
2017 looks like it will be the year that AMD returns to profitability, at least on a non-GAAP basis. The size of those profits depends on whether Ryzen and Vega live up to expectations. With Ryzen set to launch in a month or so, more details should be coming soon.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soared on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter results that bested analyst expectations. AMD's guidance called for continued revenue growth during the first quarter, and the company confirmed that its highly anticipated Ryzen CPU will be launching in early March. At 11:15 a.m. EST, the stock was up about 12%.
AMD reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.11 billion, up 15% year over year and about $40 million higher than the average analyst estimate. Revenue dropped 15% compared to the third quarter due to seasonality in the semi-custom business, which is dominated by game console SoCs.
The computing and graphics segment grew revenue by 28% year over year, to $600 million, driven by higher GPU sales. AMD launched its Polaris line of mainstream graphics cards in mid-2016. Ryzen and Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end GPU scheduled for the second quarter, should continue to drive growth in this segment in 2017.
The semi-custom segment grew revenue to $506 million, up 4% year over year. Sales slumped 39% compared to the third quarter, which is the peak period for the business each year. A $47 million segment operating profit offset a $21 million operating loss in the computing and graphics segment.
Non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) came in at a loss of $0.01, an improvement compared to a loss of $0.10 during the prior-year period and $0.01 better than analysts were expecting.
AMD expects its revenue to grow and its non-GAAP EPS to turn positive in 2017. Revenue is expected to grow by 18% year over year during the first quarter, driven by Polaris, as well as a contribution from Ryzen.
Details are still thin on both Ryzen and Vega, but more information should be revealed as we get closer to launch. If priced aggressively, both products could make a big impact on their respective markets, helping AMD win market share from Intel and NVIDIA. If AMD can avoid its habit of over promising and under delivering, 2017 could be a very good year for the company.

Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) fourth-quarter report, set to be released after the market closes on Tuesday, will be the last quarterly report prior to the launch of its highly anticipated new products. Ryzen, its upcoming high-end CPU, will launch sometime during the first quarter, and Vega, its new high-end GPU, is set for some time during the first half.
AMD is expected to grow revenue during the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period, but a steep decline compared to the third quarter is also expected. The semi-custom business, still comprised primarily of game console SoCs, peaks in the third quarter as inventory is ramped up for the holidays. AMD's mainstream Polaris graphics cards should drive some growth in the computing and graphics segment, but the company is still expected to post a non-GAAP net loss.
AMD guided for an 18% sequential decline in revenue for the fourth quarter in its third-quarter earnings report, implying revenue of roughly $1.07 billion. That's up 12% year over year, a deceleration from the 23% growth posted in the third quarter. Analysts' average estimate is in line with this guidance, with very little variation in estimates suggesting a high level of confidence.
AMD didn't provide earnings guidance, but the non-GAAP profit the company managed during the third quarter likely won't be repeated. Analysts expect a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.02 on average, an improvement from a loss of $0.10 during the fourth quarter of 2015 but a loss nonetheless.
Analysts aren't expecting much from AMD during 2017, despite two high-profile product launches. The average estimate calls for just 8.1% revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS of just $0.05 for the full year, although the ranges are wide. AMD's guidance for the first quarter should include some impact from the launch of Ryzen, so that should give investors some insight into AMD's confidence in the product. If Ryzen and Vega lead to meaningful market share gains, AMD could very well blow these estimates for 2017 out of the water.
With Ryzen potentially just a few weeks away, AMD should be announcing more information on its new line of CPUs soon. What we know so far, based on AMD's demonstrations, is that the eight-core variant of the chip is competitive with Intel products in terms of performance. AMD expects the chips to deliver greater than a 40% increase in instructions per clock, a measure of single-threaded performance, exceeding its long-held target.
We don't know much else about Ryzen. Only the eight-core version has been shown off so far, and pricing is still a mystery. Given AMD's weak position in the CPU industry, I would expect aggressive pricing from the company. Intel certainly has room to lower prices if necessary, so it will be interesting to see how disruptive Ryzen ends up. Investors should listen for any new Ryzen information during the company's earnings conference call.
The semi-custom business is still heavily dependent on the major game consoles. AMD has so far announced three semi-custom deals in addition to its original game console deals, but two of those were new versions of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The third is outside of game consoles, but AMD hasn't disclosed exactly what it is. The company had no new deals to announce after the third quarter, but CEO Lisa Su pointed to very active discussions with potential customers. Investors should expect an update on what has become an extremely important part of AMD's business.
With Ryzen and Vega still in the future, AMD's fourth-quarter report is unlikely to surprise. The company's Polaris graphics cards should drive some revenue growth in the computing and graphics segment, but a return to profitability depends on the success of its upcoming products.

            ","While the PC market as a whole has been slumping for years, the PC gaming market has only gotten stronger. Jon Peddie Research recently came out with a report pegging the size of the global PC gaming hardware market at $30 billion. This includes not only pre-built gaming PCs but also components like graphics cards and accessories like headsets and input devices.
There has been no greater beneficiary of a growing PC gaming market than graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). As rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) snagged contracts to supply chips for the major game consoles, NVIDIA's lead in the PC GPU market grew, driven by disruptive products like the GTX 900 series in late 2014. A combination of a growing PC gaming installed base and market share gains has propelled NVIDIA's gaming segment to new heights.
Image source: NVIDIA.
The growth that NVIDIA has been reporting in recent quarters has been stunning. The gaming segment, by far its largest segment, was largely responsible for driving the company's revenue higher in 2016. During the first three quarters, NVIDIA reported year-over-year gaming revenue growth of 17%, 18%, and 63%, respectively.
The major acceleration during the third quarter sent the stock soaring, and NVIDIA's fourth-quarter guidance suggests that another big increase is in the cards. The launch of NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, which have proven to be extremely popular, in mid-2016 was responsible for much of this growth. NVIDIA will also be supplying chips for Nintendo's upcoming Switch console, and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang attributed ""a fair amount"" of its gaming growth to that contract.
Revenue from Nintendo will be seasonal, likely dropping off after launch and peaking each year prior to the holiday season. That's one reason why NVIDIA's gaming segment is unlikely to keep growing consistently at a 60%-plus rate. But there's another, more basic, reason that keeping up this growth will be tough: The PC gaming hardware market just isn't growing all that fast.
Jon Peddie Research estimates that the global PC gaming hardware market will grow at a 6% compound annual rate through 2019. That's nothing to sneeze at, but NVIDIA's gaming segment is ultimately constrained by the size of the market.
There are a few ways that NVIDIA can grow faster than the market as a whole. First, that $30 billion total includes plenty of products that aren't graphics cards. Graphics card sales could certainly grow faster than the market as a whole, driving up NVIDIA's revenue at a higher rate.
Second, the graphics card market could continue to shift toward the high-end, leading revenue to grow faster than units. The high-end of the gaming hardware market is its largest segment, representing 43% of revenue. NVIDIA has been largely focused on the high-end for the past few years, driving a portion of the company's ongoing margin expansion.
There's also one thing that can hurt growth. AMD will be launching its high-end Vega GPU during the first half of 2017. This will mark the company's re-entry into the high-end portion of the market, following the failure of its Fury line of graphics cards to make a dent in 2015. It would be difficult for AMD's competitive position to get any worse, so if Vega is competitive with NVIDIA's high-end products, the growth of NVIDIA's gaming segment could suffer.
The PC gaming market is a good place to be, and NVIDIA's focus on the high end has paid dividends. The company's gaming segment can certainly continue to grow at a healthy rate, with a double-digit pace certainly possible. But expecting the 63% growth rate of the third quarter to become the new norm isn't realistic.

            ","NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) both operate in the semiconductor industry. That's about as far as their similarity goes. One is a rising star in embedded solutions and automotive computing, heading into a $47 billion merger with sector giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The other is an eternal underdog in the PC market that's working on a dramatic turnaround right now.
Which chip stock is a better fit for your portfolio? Let's find out.
The choice between AMD and NXP boils down to two simple questions:
I have often said that the Qualcomm-NXP combination looks like a lock. The two companies share very few customers and end markets, so this merger is not likely to create any sort of monopoly. Regulatory roadblocks would have to focus on the sheer scale of the buyout. Moreover, President Donald Trump is paving the way to easier megamergers by nominating anti-regulation candidates to many key government roles. So, this buyout should be a cakewalk.
Unfortunately, that high-odds risk has suddenly become more likely.
Last week, Qualcomm was served a lawsuit from major customer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), wherein the iPhone maker claims that the chipmaker has been playing extortion games with its component supply chain.
Qualcomm shares fell as much as 14% on the news, and some analysts expect the lawsuit to delay the NXP deal. Renewed scrutiny of Qualcomm's business practices could block rubber-stamp deal approvals in important territories such as China, Taiwan, and South Korea.
The Apple charge will also divert management attention and other assets from the NXP process. If nothing else, the final approval might be pushed into 2018 or beyond.
This is a real risk for the NXP merger, but I still expect the final signatures to be delivered by the end of the year. This business combination is too important to let it slide out of view. And don't forget that regulatory intervention would lead to Qualcomm sending a $1.25 billion breakup fee NXP's way.
Your mileage may vary, which is fine. But if you agree with my analysis, NXP remains a near-certain 14% return from here, and AMD needs to show a stronger hand than that.

Let's cut to the chase: AMD shares could go absolutely anywhere in 2017. That's enough to keep my finger away from the buy button.
The chipmaker had a fantastic year in 2016. AMD introduced a new graphics chip architecture to rave reviews, promised an equally game-changing update to its CPU portfolio in 2017, and saw share prices quadruple. AMD's chart has cooled down a bit in January, falling back 12% as the company prepares for a fourth-quarter report next week. But that's still a lot of market momentum. Share prices could keep skyrocketing in 2017 if the company continues to deliver on its next-generation technology promises.
That's a big if, though. AMD does not have a great track record when it comes to dependable execution, and often falls far short of ambitious goals. Recently appointed CEO Lisa Su has been a breath of fresh air so far, but she is battling the fallout from nearly a decade's worth of less-successful predecessors.
If AMD's momentum runs out, the stock has a long way to fall. AMD's trailing earnings and EBITDA profits are negative, and free cash flows stand at a razor-thin $148 million. Lacking the support of traditional valuation builders, the stock chart would take a dramatic nosedive in a hurry on the slightest of errors.
AMD owners can win big or lose big here. That's a poker chip, not an investment thesis.
By contrast, NXP offers a near-guaranteed 14% return. Even if the Qualcomm deal falls apart, there's a quick $1.25 billion cash payment in it for NXP investors.
This one isn't a close call. I would take NXP over AMD in a heartbeat.

The tech sector was the market's top performer in 2016, and its deep and far-reaching impact on business and everyday life suggests it will continue to be a go-to for investors seeking tremendous growth opportunities. Technology is fast-moving and tends to be highly competitive, so companies that operate in tech -- including Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), Qualcomm, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- are constantly facing new pressures that influence future outcomes. While investing in the broader space has been historically rewarding over the past two decades, staying on top of the dynamics that are shaping the industry is essential for new and seasoned investors alike.
To provide readers with a primer on some of the most important elements shaping the financial performance of tech companies, we asked three of The Motley Fool's top writers to each spotlight one of the most important things to know about the technology sector.
Brian Feroldi: One of the most challenging aspects of investing in the tech sector is that competition tends to be fierce. That fact makes it quite difficult for companies to maintain their profit margins over the long term, which can lead to disastrous results for investors. 
A nice case study of this principle in action can be seen by comparing the long-term results of two semiconductor manufacturers -- Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Skyworks Solutions. Over the past decade, AMD has struggled to convince customers that its chips are deserving of a premium price tag, which has led to a significant decline in the company's gross profit margin. Over the same time period, Skyworks' focus on manufacturing specialty chips that are used in mobile devices has allowed it to increase its gross profit margin.

AMD's inability to maintain its profit margin has caused its stock to languish. Skyworks, on the other hand, has turned out to be a home-run investment. 

AMD data by YCharts
The takeaway here is clear -- before you buy a tech stock, or any stock for that matter, ask yourself if the company will be able to maintain its pricing power over the long term. If the answer is no, your money is probably best invested elsewhere.
Keith Noonan: The tech industry is going through a major period of consolidation, as companies operating in the sector aim to create defensive benefits, quickly ramp up competencies in emerging categories such as the Internet of Things, and build encompassing platforms that keep customers engaged in their ecosystems. 2016 saw a huge acquisitions push across hardware, software, and services. Qualcomm's $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors was the biggest deal of the year and rapidly accelerated the company's position in connected cars. Intel also went on a purchasing spree to strengthen its competitiveness in automobile chips and services. Companies with strengths in the Internet of Things will continue to be acquisition targets going forward, and 2017 looks to be another big year for purchases related to connectivity and data analytics technologies.
Many of tech's big players are also buying up assets outside of the sector -- and entertainment companies are emerging as common acquisitions targets. With Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet dominating the advertising business and making moves toward disrupting the traditional internet service provider and wireless carrier models, some companies threatened by the commoditization of their services are responding by bolstering their positions in content. Comcast continued its push to grow its studio entertainment business by buying DreamWorks Animation in 2016, and AT&T has made an $85.4 billion bid to acquire Time Warner -- a move that comes on the heels of its $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV. The AT&T and Time Warner merger faces regulatory obstacles to closing, but the power held by Facebook and Google and the broader climate of consolidation bolster the case for approval.
Buying a company in the hopes that it will be acquired is a risky investment strategy, but there's incredible momentum in acquisitions, and it seems all-but-certain that the tech industry will continue to be shaped by the ongoing consolidation push.
Brian Stoffel: There is, perhaps, no skill set more in demand than those who know how to code, create, and design technology, especially when it comes to designing user-friendly interfaces. There's a huge chasm between the techno-nerds who know how to make stuff, and the rest of us mere mortals. Having a team of individuals who take a very complex system, and make it very simple and easy to use, is what separates the winners from the losers in the technology field.
That's why attracting -- and retaining -- top talent is so important in the technology sector. It helps explain why companies such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) can pull in $415 million in free cash flow over the past year and still post a loss of $380 million . Much of that difference is in the form of enormous equity bonus packages paid to employees.
One way I like to note how well a company is doing at keeping its talent is by going through Glassdoor.com reviews. Companies such as Facebook do extremely well, with an average rating of 4.5 stars out of 5.0. And organizations that ""get"" what motivates a workforce can make a huge difference as well.
Consider an excerpt from a 2010 filing by Alphabet subsidiary Google. In it, management said: 
[Monetary] incentives are secondary to career growth, work environment, and engaging work opportunities. We seek to develop a highly motivated and collaborative workforce that pursues achievements for the sake of progress and innovation. 
It's that type of thinking that can turn technology companies into decades-long wealth builders, and it's what investors should be looking for.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 295% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. A return to revenue growth, a series of deals that bolstered the balance sheet, the launch of its mainstream Polaris graphics cards, and optimism regarding new CPUs and GPUs set to launch in the coming months drove the stock higher.
AMD entered 2016 in rough shape. Revenue in 2015 slumped 28%, leading to a net loss of more than $400 million. Cash was dwindling, approaching the lower limit of the company's target range. On top of all that, AMD's core CPU and GPU products were largely not competitive with those of Intel or NVIDIA.
AMD took a few steps in 2016 to raise cash, giving it some much-needed breathing room that boosted investor confidence in a turnaround. A deal to create a joint venture in China around the company's x86 server technology raised $293 million in licensing fees, with the potential for royalties on sales of chips. More cash was raised later in the year when AMD sold new common stock and convertible notes, further bolstering the balance sheet.

Data by YCharts.
AMD returned to year-over-year revenue growth during the second quarter and posted even stronger growth during the third quarter. The launch of the Polaris mainstream graphics cards lifted the computing and graphics segment, while strong demand for semi-custom game console chips drove growth in the semi-custom segment. Polaris hasn't been as big of a success as NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, at least according to Steam's hardware and software survey numbers, but it did help return the company to growth.
AMD revealed some information about Ryzen, its upcoming CPU, and Vega, its upcoming high-end GPU, last year, adding fuel to the fire. The market is betting that AMD will become competitive in both the high-end CPU and GPU markets when those products launch during the first half of 2017.
There's no question that AMD is in a stronger position than it was at the end of 2015. The top line and balance sheet are looking stronger, and Ryzen and Vega have the potential to return the company to profitability.
But investors should not forget AMD's long history of over-promising and under-delivering. The Bulldozer family of CPUs launched in 2011 turned out to be a complete disaster for the company. The Fury line of high-end GPUs launched in 2015 didn't even move the needle despite AMD hyping up its use of high-bandwidth memory. And Polaris, while producing some growth for the company, has been completely overshadowed by NVIDIA's Pascal.
2017 may be different. Based on what AMD has said so far, both Ryzen and Vega have some serious potential. But if either product comes up short of expectations, the stock's impressive gains from last year could quickly vanish.

Investors love stocks that give them massive returns. The most common way to get huge gains is to invest for the long run, counting on fundamental business success to produce ample dividends and lucrative share-price appreciation. Yet sometimes, gains come in a very quick period of time, and a very small number of stocks have managed to quadruple in value in just the past year. Below, we'll look at Ariad Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ARIA), U.S. Steel (NYSE:X), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to see whether investors who are seeing the companies for the very first time will be able to squeeze out any more gains from their stocks.

ARIA data by YCharts.
Ariad Pharmaceuticals has seen the bulk of its share gains come very recently. Throughout 2016, excitement built up for Ariad's Iclusig treatment for two rare forms of leukemia. Yet although the treatment had good results for the blood and bone marrow diseases, the high price tag that Ariad charged for the drug made some investors nervous that more stringent federal regulation of drug prices could result in lower long-term profits for the company. Those fears largely abated after the presidential election, as investors see President-elect Donald Trump as being less likely to encourage regulation and allowing Ariad to earn its profits longer.
Then, just earlier this week, Ariad announced that Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda Pharmaceutical would buy out Ariad in an all-cash deal worth $5.2 billion. The $24-per-share price for the takeover sent Ariad up 73% in a single day, bringing its gains to nearly 350% since this time last year. Going forward, investors can't expect any further share-price gains from Ariad given the buyout bid, and although few expect roadblocks to the deal, there's at least some chance that a rejection of the merger could send Ariad shares back downward.
U.S. Steel's big gains have come from steady upward movement throughout the past year. Even before the presidential election, prospects for healthier economic conditions across the globe had investors getting more excited about the steel industry. Moreover, favorable rulings from the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed anti-dumping tariffs on foreign competitors, creating greater opportunities for U.S. Steel to compete more effectively against foreign competition.
The presidential election also led to a big bounce for U.S. Steel. Plans to boost infrastructure spending were bullish for the construction industry, and steel will likely play a substantial role in any infrastructure rebuilding or new construction that takes place. Exactly how far that can pull U.S. Steel's profits higher remains to be seen, but investors are excited enough to have given the stock a more than 375% return over the past 12 months in anticipation of better times ahead. Shareholders shouldn't expect another quadruple in the near future, but the stock hasn't necessarily hit its top just yet.
Finally, Advanced Micro Devices has been the winner of this group, with its stock climbing more than 435% since this time last year. Several victories have helped propel the semiconductor company higher, including a couple of deals to create joint ventures with partners in Asia. The sale of its semiconductor assembly and test assets to Nanton Fujitsu Microelectronics gave AMD about $320 million in cash to launch strategic efforts of its own, and another deal with Tianjin Haiguang earned AMD almost $300 million more for licensing its x86 server chips for the Chinese server market.
The biggest win for Advanced Micro Devices came from its Polaris graphics cards, which have helped it become an even bigger player in the graphics processing unit market. Major customers have replied by using AMD chips in their own products, eating into the commanding lead that NVIDIA has had for years. Even if Advanced Micro Devices maintains only modest market shares in key markets, the opportunities there are big enough for the stock to keep climbing sharply in 2017 and beyond.
Investors can't count on any stock they own quadrupling in such a short period of time. Although Ariad's upside is almost nonexistent, both AMD and U.S. Steel could continue to see gains if things keep going well in their respective markets.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 27.3% in the month of December, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, continuing its stellar climb on encouraging rumors and as analysts continued to express optimism for shares of the graphics chip specialist.
For perspective, AMD stock climbed more than 300% when all was said and done in 2016, including a 23% rise in November after the company announced its Radeon GPU technology will be available to Google Cloud Platform users starting in 2017.
But shares began their December rise early in the month after rumors surfaced that AMD has struck a deal with Intel to license its Radeon graphics technology. If this rumor proves true, Intel is apparently planning to integrate that technology into its future processors.
Two days later, analysts at Merrill Lynch upgraded AMD stock to ""buy"" from ""underperform,"" effectively reversing a negative call made more than two years ago and admitting they missed out on AMD's stunning turnaround. Analysts at Mizuho Securities followed suit two weeks later, citing significant opportunities for gross margin expansion given incremental revenue from deep learning application wins for AMD's ProGFx, Ryzen, and Zen chips.
I'm a firm proponent of the idea that winners keep on winning, so it's no surprise to see Wall Street analysts offering their respective votes of confidence as AMD executes its ongoing business turnaround. If AMD can indeed improve its gross margin in the coming year while identifying additional compelling growth industries to put its flagship GPU technology to work, it will be equally unsurprising to see AMD stock keep delivering market-beating returns going forward.

Some great investment returns just sneak up on you. That stock you're watching seems primed for nothing special, or maybe a downright disaster. Then the chart squiggles suddenly skyrocket, rewarding shareholders with massive returns.
And you missed it.
Here at the end of 2016, that's how I feel about longtime graphics-chip rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Their stock charts took a drastic positive turn this year, leaving me flat-footed alongside many other investors.
And you know what? I kind of wish I had added to my Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stake in early February, or perhaps the middle of the summer. But I didn't. So here I am, telling you all about those missed opportunities instead.
Let's be honest -- nobody, but nobody, had any real reason to believe that NVIDIA or AMD would soar sky-high in 2016.
Both companies were polishing up brand-new architectures for their graphics chips, and AMD was also preparing to launch a new platform for PC and server processors. That might sound promising at first glance, but both companies have a history of fumbling important technology launches.
NVIDIA and AMD shares were already on a roll, as investors were hoping for the best out of those important chip announcements. As New Year's rolled around, the stocks had gained more than 60% in just five months. That could very well have been the end of this story, setting investors up for huge corrections if anything went wrong.
But both AMD and NVIDIA reached into their top hats to produce some good-looking bunny rabbits. They proceeded to unveil the new NVIDIA Pascal and AMD Polaris chips, selling truckloads of these products in the second half of the year. AMD delivered three earnings surprises in 2016 along with strong top-line results, and NVIDIA blew every target out of the water.
I did not see any of this coming, and can only glare ruefully at their year-to-date returns. NVIDIA shares have more than tripled, showing a 235% return this year, while AMD quadrupled to the tune of 304%.
Now, AMD pushed its PC and server chip releases into 2017, but Polaris is pulling its weight with confidence in the meantime. Both Polaris and Pascal have the potential to reach brand-new markets, as their number-crunching powers happen to be very useful for supercomputing tasks such as real-time artificial intelligence and high-speed data analysis.
Will these turnarounds reach even higher highs next year? You tell me. AMD and NVIDIA must continue to execute in order to reach higher, which is hardly a guaranteed outcome if you've been following these companies for a few years. In particular, AMD cannot afford to flub its next processor launch, because graphics products account for less than one-third of AMD's overall sales. This launch will make or break the bulk of AMD's revenue stream.
So I'm staying away from both AMD and Nvidia here because I'm not terribly convinced that the smooth sailing will continue. And even if you disagree with my assessment of the investment risks involved, it would be reckless to back up the truck at this point. Momentum plays can be great while they last but they cannot last forever, you know.

Okay, so why do I feel like I stiffed myself by not buying more Netflix this year? The stock is only trading sideways year to date.
For starters, the ever-volatile stock took some dramatic dives in February and July. The first drop provided as much as a 30% discount, and the summer swoon stopped at roughly 28%. Share prices have recovered strongly from these troughs, mostly thanks to a rock-solid earnings report in October. If you bought Netflix shares on Feb. 8, you'd be enjoying a 52% return on that investment today.
That's still less impressive than AMD's or NVIDIA's soaring jumps, I know. But the thing is, it was always obvious that these Netflix discounts would be temporary. They were negative reactions to positive news, opening obvious buy-in windows. I'm feeling silly for letting these opportunities pass me by.
In February, Netflix had just achieved nearly worldwide coverage with its streaming video services. That's paving the way toward massive revenue and profit growth in the long run, but at the cost of high short-term expenses. Result: lower share prices for all the wrong, downright myopic reasons.
Then, the company reported fourth-quarter results where pretty much every business metric came in ahead of management's guidance targets. But traders focused on the small miss on domestic subscriber additions, complained about the high costs of rolling out a global service, and punished the stock some more. Again, for all the wrong reasons.
The same issues festered for months, weighing heavily on Netflix shares for no good reason. Another turn in soft subscriber additions followed in July, as consumers turned their attention to election coverage and the Rio Olympics instead of to Netflix content: obviously a short-lived issue, with a near-certain rebound coming up ahead.
More missed opportunities.
The third-quarter report in October swept away many of the cobwebs, and Netflix shares broke loose to new all-time highs. Yes, a $46 billion market cap can grow 20% larger overnight.
No more deep-discount buying windows.
Yes, I wish I had dipped just a little deeper into the Netflix well at some point in 2016. There was really no reason not to, and several blindingly obvious chances to make a move.
Netflix already accounts for about one-third of my total nest egg, so I'll console myself with the fact that I'm spreading my eggs across several baskets instead. But Netflix remains the best investment idea on the table today, and looks likely to make a big positive move in 2017 as management is shifting its focus from expansion to turning a profit.
I'm not exactly missing out on that jump, but I could have taken an even bigger position at a fantastic buy-in price.
Oh, well. Always forward.

The gaming sector has performed well in 2016, with many of the top names in the space, from Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) to chipmaker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), posting solid returns. Well-received new content, impressive new technology, and renewed ideas about how to get both of those to consumers have helped the sector grow this year. Here were some of the winners in 2016, and what the future could hold for these companies.

Of the content creators and licensors, Nintendo was the best-performing in its group in 2016, with more than a 50% rise through the year to date. Though it was up around 80% before a mid-December sell-off, the company has still had a remarkable year. Nintendo's resurgence follows the company's decision to finally develop a mobile strategy and bring its timeless characters and stories into a modern age.
Nintendo was one of the big winners with the Pokemon Go phenomenon that exploded worldwide this year, and the company announced a new game console called Switch to come out in 2017, which has helped to raise its stock price as well. Most recently, Nintendo launched a new mobile game called Super Mario Run, which topped the download charts during its first weekend, with around 5 million downloads its first day. The game has had some disappointing reviews so far, pushing Nintendo's YTD growth lower, but it's still the early days of Nintendo's new mobile game strategy, so it's certainly not game over yet.

Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) was also a top performer within the gaming content space, posting a 40% jump in share price this year. Take-Two, maker of popular games such as Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K17, has grown sales 21% in the most recent quarter, year over year. The company has also been able to adopt a more digitally focused strategy, which has helped margins so that, while earnings fell year over year, they were far above analyst estimates in the most recent quarter. 
Aside from the actual content creators, some gaming platform companies also performed well this year. Sony (NYSE:SNE) gets a spot on this list largely thanks to the launch of its PlayStation 4 gaming system and more recent launch of a premium virtual reality (VR) bundle that brings VR game play to mass-market gamers. Gaming makes up only about 20% of Sony's total revenue, but it's also its fastest-growing division and could help push the stock higher as more games for its VR headset come out in 2017.

In China, where video game sales are booming and there are an estimated 700 million mobile users and growing, local platform company NetEase (NASDAQ: NTES) has been a winner, with a 19% jump in share price this year. With an assortment of its own online games (among many online services from email to advertising), NetEase also has a deal with content companies such as Activision Blizzard to distribute its games across China, such as one of the hottest games this year, Overwatch, which has done very well in China.
While the content and the platforms for playing it on are the face of the gaming industry, the technology inside the devices -- be it gaming consoles, computers, or virtual reality headsets -- are chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA. These two companies have each made big plays so far in 2016, not just in gaming -- though that has been a growth driver for both companies, with each putting out new high-power chips for intense gaming -- but also in autonomous cars, artificial intelligence, connected devices within the Internet of things, and more. As a result of this growth, AMD and NVIDIA stocks are up 280% and 210%, respectively, year to date. 
While these content, platform, and chip companies did well this year as the gaming industry continued to grow, bricks-and-mortar video games and gaming hardware seller GameStop (NYSE: GME) had a rough year, which has pushed its stock down 8% so far in 2016. GameStop's business model has struggled to update amid a changing consumer landscape. Looking forward, this trend is likely to grow, as the gaming industry moves to a more e-commerce-focused market, and content creators continually seek a model of digital downloads. The companies with the best content and the most interesting technology are the ones to expect to lead growth in 2017.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will report a net loss this year, making 2016 the fifth consecutive year that AMD has failed to turn a profit. 2017 is shaping up to be better for AMD, with the launch of its new Ryzen CPUs and high-end Vega GPUs on the horizon. The success of those products will determine whether AMD will return to profitability next year and beyond.
AMD investors are no doubt looking forward to 2017, and the company made some good moves this year that have improved its chances of success. The balance sheet is stronger and its prospects are brighter thanks to AMD's best moves of 2016.

At the end of the first quarter of 2016, AMD's balance sheet was looking stretched. The company's cash balance was barely above $700 million, near the low end of its target range, and debt topped $2.2 billion. Book value had plunged to negative $500 million thanks to years of losses.
In April, AMD sold its semiconductor assembly and test assets into a joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, retaining a 15% stake and receiving about $320 million in cash, net of taxes and other expenses. This deal provided AMD with some much-needed cash as it was preparing to launch Polaris, its mainstream-orientated GPU.
Around the same time, AMD signed a deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. to form another JV, this one focused on bringing x86 server SoCs to the Chinese server market. AMD licensed its high-performance processor and SoC technology to the JV, receiving a $293 million licensing payment with the potential for additional royalty payments in the future.
These two deals greatly strengthened AMD's balance sheet, giving it the necessary resources to forge ahead with its turnaround plan.
Shares of AMD have soared this year, driven higher by optimism that the company's new products will drive revenue and earnings growth. The stock is up nearly 300% year to date, reflecting an extreme shift in investor sentiment.

AMD data by YCharts.
AMD took advantage of its soaring stock price in August when it announced that it was selling $600 million of new shares of its common stock, along with $700 million of 2.125% notes. The company planned to use the proceeds to knock down some of its debt, thus reducing its annual interest payments and making the path to profitability a little bit easier. AMD paid $160 million in interest payments in 2015.
AMD now has $1.26 billion of cash on its balance sheet, and it has reduced its total debt to about $1.63 billion. The company's financial situation, precarious earlier this year, is now much stronger, giving it the resources to launch its new CPUs and GPUs next year. Existing investors were diluted by the stock sale, but they should be thrilled that AMD used the opportunity to raise cash.
For those wanting to utilize graphics cards in the cloud, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has long been the only real option. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud all offer NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs exclusively. The company's focus over the past few years on deep learning and GPU compute has paid off. NVIDIA's data center business is nearing a $1 billion annual revenue run rate, with third-quarter sales nearly tripling year over year.
AMD's GPUs aren't available on any of those platforms, and it's fallen far behind NVIDIA in the market for accelerators. An analyst at Nomura estimates that NVIDIA controls 80% of the accelerator market, with AMD and Intel fighting for the scraps.

AMD made some headway in 2016. Alphabet's Google announced in November that it planned to offer AMD's FirePro GPUs through its cloud platform, along with NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs as well. While this is win for both AMD and NVIDIA, it narrows the gap a little between the two companies.
AMD built on this momentum with the announcement of Radeon Instinct in December, the company's upcoming line of graphics cards built specifically for deep learning. The company is playing catch-up in this area, but the potential opportunity to accelerate A.I. workloads is significant. NVIDIA is still the undisputed leader in the accelerator market, but AMD made some noise in 2016.

Tuesday is turning out to be a great day to be a tech investor. Earlier this morning, three big upgrades came out of Wall Street. First, Mizuho Securities upgraded AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) to buy, then Goldman Sachs followed with upgrades of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) to neutral -- and in the day's biggest move, upgraded NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock to conviction buy.
According to the analysts, AMD stock has the potential to rise 14% in value (new price target: $13). Western Digital, on the other hand, up 52% already since Goldman mistakenly put it on its sell list back in August, has probably peaked already (Goldman says it's worth only $68 a share). The strongest prospects of all, however, can be found at NVIDIA -- where Goldman believes the stock could shoot up a further 22% to a target price of $129 per share.
Here are three things you need to know.

Computer chip stocks are lighting up. Image source: Getty Images.
Let's begin with the day's biggest news. StreetInsider.com reports this morning that Goldman Sachs has added NVIDIA to its ""conviction buy list,"" citing the company's ability to benefit from ""positive secular trends in gaming, VR (virtual reality), AI (artificial intelligence)/ML (machine learning) and automotive."" According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, most analysts who follow the stock think NVIDIA will grow its earnings about 10% annually over the next five years -- but Goldman sees a whole lot more in store.
In particular, Goldman sees revenue from NVIDIA's data center business (i.e., storage) nearly doubling in fiscal 2018, and growing 53% again in fiscal 2019. (Here it's important to remember that NVIDIA operates on an accelerated financial calendar. Right now, we're in the middle of fiscal Q4 2017, so when Goldman talks about fiscal 2018, it really means next year -- 2017.) Gaming revenue, too, will be above-trend, with Goldman predicting 20% sales growth there next year, followed by 28% one year after.
Clearly, Goldman is expecting NVIDIA to grow a whole lot faster than anyone else out there, and the analyst predicts that ""estimate revisions [will] serve as a positive catalyst for the stock in the coming quarters"" as other analysts begin to realize that they were wrong, and Goldman Sachs was right. (Modesty has never been one of Goldman's defining virtues.)
That's actually kind of curious, given that at the same time as Goldman is loudly proclaiming its faith in NVIDIA stock, it's also fessing up to a pretty massive miss in its predictions for Western Digital. As Goldman admits, four months ago it told investors to sell Western Digital because the company was spending too much on capex, and building capacity to serve a NAND market that would be in critical ""oversupply"" by 2017.
Now however, Goldman says it was off base on that prediction. ""NAND prices for SSDs and retail may be up 5-10% qoq in 1Q17,"" says Goldman. In addition, a weak Japanese yen is likely to add close to 4% to Western Digital's gross margin this coming year. All this has led to a 52% spike in Western Digital's stock price since Goldman panned it.
Late to the party, Goldman is upgrading Western Digital -- but only to neutral, as the analyst expects to be proven right...eventually.
Meanwhile, elsewhere on Wall Street, analysts have been warming up to AMD stock for some weeks now. This morning, Mizuho Securities joined the club with an endorsement for AMD stock, agreeing that it sees potential in the company's ProGFx, Ryzen and Zen chips for applications in deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI).
Mizuho sees these markets powering AMD's gross margin in years to come. In fact, it sees gross margin potentially doubling from ""~30%"" to perhaps 60% as early as Q2 2017. Applying these margins to as much as $1 billion in incremental revenue from DL, the analyst believes AMD could earn as much as $0.30 in extra operating profit next year.
Granted, even if this prediction comes true, Mizuho still doesn't see AMD turning profitable next year, but only losing $0.05 per share instead of $0.06 per share. But looking out to 2018, the analyst believes AMD could be solidly profitable, and earning as much as $0.14 per share across its several businesses.
If true, that would be great news for AMD investors -- profits at last, after five straight years (and soon to be six) of losing money. On the other hand, even $0.14 per share in profits would result in about a 93 P/E ratio on the stock -- which both seems a mite high, and won't materialize for two more years at the earliest.
Going back through our list in reverse order, Western Digital is also currently unprofitable, and likely to end 2016 with a loss. But next year, analysts are forecasting $2.02 per share in earnings, valuing the stock at about 35 times forward earnings based on today's $70 share price. Given analyst expectations for 10% long-term earnings growth, this also seems expensive.
And finally, in true ""first shall be last"" fashion, we come to NVIDIA. Goldman Sachs has very high hopes for this one, as we've seen. Investors should note, however, that the consensus among analysts is still for NVIDIA to earn no more than $2.44 per share next year. At the stock's current price of $105 and change, that works out to a forward P/E ratio of 43. Much as I like NVIDIA as a business, the stock still looks too rich for my blood.
Honestly, Wall Street may love all these stocks -- but I wouldn't touch any one of them.

Though there are certainly some challengers, it's hard to find a hotter tech stock than Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Heading into the finish line for 2016, AMD stock has risen an astronomical 275% in 2016, roughly 34 times the Nasdaq Composite's respectable 8% uptick for the year:

AMD data by YCharts.
No stock rises so fast without an underlying catalyst, and that is indeed the case with AMD shares. The company has done an admirable job making the most of its unique exposure to the computer microprocessor (CPU) and graphics (GPU) markets. So if AMD is doing so well, why is this article about better alternatives to its stock?
Despite its recent renaissance, AMD's business model isn't necessarily as bulletproof as its 2016 rally might imply. As you'll see, other semiconductor makers hold stronger competitive positions in the two core markets where AMD hopes to gain market share. Consequently, here are two better semiconductor stocks than AMD today.
After struggling to find a place in the mobile revolution, graphics processing unit (GPU) leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has found itself unexpectedly at the heart of some of the most exciting growth markets in tech today. Self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and big data might sound like buzz words to some, but to NVIDIA, they're core markets for its high-end graphics chips. In fact, NVIDIA saw double-digit growth in the three business segments that cater to these markets. In terms of being more attractive than AMD, this leadership position in higher-growth semiconductor markets would be enough to make NVIDIA the better buy.

However, NVIDIA remains better positioned in the market where it competes directly with AMD, despite recent success on AMD's part. It's no secret that AMD has stolen some of NVIDIA's market share for desktop GPUs, but this overlooks two important facts. First, the overall market for PC graphics chips is shrinking in terms of unit shipments, making AMD's success in this space somewhat less appealing. What is more, NVIDIA's popularity among gamers, an enthusiast market that covets top-notch performance, has allowed it to continue to increase costs in the face of falling PC sales. Furthermore, NVIDIA is rumored to be preparing a lower-cost graphics chip to defend its market share from AMD next year. So for long-term investors comparing the two, NVIDIA is a better choice.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) dominates the market for PC and server microprocessors, and a meaningful part of AMD's recent rally has been fueled by the assumption that AMD can steal some market share from Intel in one or both of these industries.
Much has been made of AMD's forthcoming Zen CPU, which could offer graphics advantages over Intel's current chips, as Intel's chip roadmap appears focused on driving computing-performance improvements as usual. It still seems more likely that consumer preferences will be biased toward valuing faster computing power over moderately improved graphics.
Looking at the bigger picture, Intel's massive resource advantage over AMD -- Intel's research-and-development budget is larger than AMD's total revenues  -- should insulate it from individual design wins that might translate into a longer-term shift away from its chips. Intel might not be the growth giant that it was a generation ago, but in my eyes its financial muscle and strong tradition of execution still make it a safer long-term bet than AMD's high-flying shares.
In many ways, this article is as much an argument for NVIDIA and Intel shares as it is a caution against AMD stock. As a company, AMD is undoubtedly improving. AMD has adeptly tapped into its core opportunity in the console gaming market, while looking to position its mix of computing and graphics know-how as an alternative to NVIDIA and Intel in their respective markets.
Though this strategy could certainly work, it will be hard to dislodge either NVIDIA or Intel from their respective positions of strength. As we've seen in other consumer-hardware verticals like the PC market, cost advantages rarely trump performance advantages, so in this way AMD remains at a disadvantage to both Intel and NVIDIA.
What's more, we're still early in AMD's comeback story, and the company has fallen badly on its face in the past. So while AMD shares have eviscerated the market over the past 12 months, it's far less clear that the company can do so again over the next 12.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have soared a staggering 280% year to date. The company is still unprofitable, but investors are betting that AMD is on the verge of a historic turnaround. Polaris, AMD's mainstream-oriented GPU, launched earlier this year, producing growth in the company's core business after a long streak of disappointing results. AMD is set to re-enter the high-end GPU market next year with Vega, and its Ryzen CPU, formerly known as Zen, will look to challenge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) during the first quarter.

AMD data by YCharts.
AMD has also seen some momentum in an area that has been so far dominated by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Alphabet's Google announced last month that it planned to install both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs into its data centers, offering them as part of its cloud platform. While NVIDIA's products are already available through most of the major cloud-computing vendors, AMD has been slower out of the gate, making the Google deal a significant win for the company. Radeon Instinct, a new line of graphics cards aimed at machine learning set to launch in 2017, will put AMD in the running to power artificial intelligence workloads.
With such a large gain in such a short period of time, investors are right to ask: Can it last? If everything goes right for AMD next year, the stock could be in for further gains. But it won't take much going wrong for 2017 to be a bad year for the stock, even if it's a relatively good year for the company. Here are three reasons AMD stock could fall next year.

Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
Looking at AMD's stock chart tells a story of extreme optimism followed by disappointment. Shares of AMD have spiked before, in the early 2000s and again around 2006, only to collapse when the company failed to deliver. The company's current market capitalization isn't yet at an all-time high, but it's at the highest level in nearly a decade.

AMD Operating Income (Annual) data by YCharts.
In AMD's best year in the past 10, the company managed to earn a net income of about $500 million. The market is currently valuing AMD at around 20 times that number. In other words, investors are not only betting that AMD will make a comeback, but that its profits will soar to record levels. That's a bold bet for a company that has a long history of disappointing investors.
This time could be different. AMD has a semi-custom business that's producing profits for the company, and it appears that Ryzen could give Intel a run for its money. But if the bull case doesn't unfold exactly as expected, a major correction could sting investors next year.
Polaris produced some growth for AMD, with its computing and graphics segment revenue jumping 11% year over year during the third quarter. But NVIDIA stole the show, registering 63% growth in its gaming segment, driven by its new Pascal graphics cards. Both companies benefited from strong demand for graphics cards during the quarter, but NVIDIA claimed a bigger piece of the pie.
Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform, collects hardware data from its users, and the most recent results suggest that NVIDIA's dominance isn't going away. The only Polaris graphics card to register on the survey is the RX 480, which claimed just 0.37% of Steam users in November. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's GTX 1080, 1070, and 1060, all higher-end cards launched around the same time, were being used by 0.86%, 1.59%, and 1.53% of users, respectively.
AMD plans to launch more powerful graphics cards based on its upcoming Vega GPU next year, hoping to challenge NVIDIA in the high-margin high end of the market. AMD is certainly in a better competitive position today than it was in a year ago, but Polaris hasn't been the runaway success that the company needed it to be. Vega will need to be a home run. If it's not, AMD investors could be in for a rough ride next year.
AMD recently provided details on Ryzen, its upcoming line of CPUs formerly known as Zen. Ryzen processors for desktops are expected to be available during the first quarter of 2017, with notebook variants coming during the second half. The company demonstrated that an eight-core version of Ryzen matched or beat Intel's i7 6900K in a few tasks, including image rendering and video transcoding.
Ryzen comes with some new features, including improved prefetching driven by learning algorithms meant to minimize bottlenecks, and a refined boost system that allows clock speeds to be adjusted. It's built on a 14-nanometer FinFET process, meaning that the manufacturing gap between AMD and Intel is at its narrowest in years. If Ryzen is competitive on a performance-per-dollar basis with Intel's chips, AMD could gain a meaningful amount of market share.
The only benchmarks we've seen so far have been from AMD, and at this point we know nothing about the more mainstream versions of Ryzen or the pricing. Ryzen needs to offer a compelling value proposition to compel Intel users to switch, and we won't know if that's the case until third-party benchmarks and pricing details surface. Even with Ryzen looking like it's going to be a competitive product, anything short of significant market share gains for AMD could send the stock tumbling.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is on a massive roll right now. Share prices have more than quadrupled over the last 52 weeks, and AMD stock is trading at prices not seen since 2007.
Investors are loving this rare return to form, but is it too late to jump aboard the AMD bandwagon? Let's have a deeper look at the risks involved in an AMD investment.
There's no doubt AMD has done a lot of things right in 2016. The company deserves kudos for the strong launch of a new graphics platform formerly known as Polaris. Even though graphics-segment arch-rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also bowed a fresh graphics platform to an equally warm welcome, Polaris chips made AMD an instant challenger in the supercomputing and data center markets. Yes, chips designed to handle digital graphics tasks happen to be great at other forms of intense number-crunching as well. So Polaris has opened a bunch of new doors for AMD.
In the words of CEO Lisa Su, AMD is now a high-performance computing company more than anything else. She is aiming her Polaris platform at a global market worth about $50 billion a year, including data center servers and immersive digital experiences. The company is only getting started on a multiyear roadmap, which includes a new general processing architecture launch in 2017.
These are the reasons AMD shares are trading near decade-spanning record prices today.
The shift into high-performance computing has not been completely smooth. Along the way, NVIDIA won the lucrative contract to power the next Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) console. Nintendo has been in AMD's pocket since the original Wii system, helping the company keep its proverbial nose above the water in recent years.
NVIDIA might also pose a serious challenge when the other console builders get around to launching the next generation of hardware systems. If so, about half of AMD's current revenue sources could be headed to NVIDIA instead. Sure, AMD could still win those contracts and keep its sales streams fairly intact, but losing Nintendo is not a positive sign in the early going. Investors must be prepared for the potential of a big setback here.
The thing is, investors are acting as if AMD were set up to deliver a steady stream of sustainable profits from here on out. And that's not even remotely true.
The company only occasionally manages to deliver positive operating profits, EBITDA earnings, or free cash flows. In general, you can expect the bottom-line numbers to show up deeply in the red. The overall trend isn't even positive.
AMD is sacrificing top-line revenue to explore new markets. That kind of move is usually expected to come with stronger profit margins, but not in AMD's case. Buying this stock today -- or holding on to your existing shares -- amounts to a bet on AMD's future prospects. The Polaris-based graphics boost needs to have legs, or the bottom falls out. On top of that, it's not enough to just maintain whatever positive trends the company has on the table today. AMD is still losing money by the bucketful, and it needs to tighten up the leaking ship.
Deliver on all of these promises, and AMD shares will hold steady -- or maybe rise even higher. Fall short anywhere at all, and that's the end of the new golden era.
Yes, this stock could skyrocket over the next several years if management executes flawlessly. But in my view, the chances of that happening are slim to none. It's a small boat in a big sea, surrounded on all sides by rivals with more experience and stronger balance sheets. AMD simply can't afford any mistakes, and perfection doesn't come easy.
Long story short, AMD investors will need an iron stomach.

Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) stock price has skyrocketed in 2016, jumping more than 260% since the beginning of the year. But this year brought more than just stock price gains for the company. 
AMD's revenues bounced back this year from one of their lowest points last year, and the company managed to expand its discrete desktop GPU market share against rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) as well. Additionally, AMD is poised to benefit from the expanding virtual reality market. 
Here's how all of this looks for AMD in three charts.
AMD's revenue has fallen about 28% from its five-year high, and it now sit at about $1.3 billion in the most recent quarter. But while the company is far below its five-year high, AMD's revenues are starting to move back in the right direction. The second and third quarters both saw positive revenue gains on a year-over-year basis, with the biggest jump -- 23% -- coming in the third quarter.  
Image source: YCharts.
Much of the growth came from four straight quarters of growth in the company's professional graphics products. Investors should know that fourth-quarter revenues are expected to decline on a sequential basis as the company moves away from its usual ""annual semi custom sales peak in the third quarter."" But even with that decline, fourth-quarter revenue is expected to increase 12% year over year at the midpoint of guidance. 
AMD expects revenue to be up just 6% for full-year 2016. Investors should keep a close eye on the company's ability grow sales -- and whether it can continue pushing revenue back in the right direction as AMD heads into the new year. 
Another bright spot for AMD right now is the company's discrete desktop GPU market share. The company's graphics processors compete directly with NVIDIA, and while AMD is still an underdog, it's starting to gain momentum. 
Last year, AMD had fallen to about 18% market share, but it's slowly ticked up since then and now stands at about an estimated 30%.

AMD still has a long way to go to best NVIDIA's GPUs, but with the GPU market essentially a two-player game at this point, any gains AMD makes in the space should directly help the company's revenues. 
The virtual reality (VR) market is just getting started, but AMD is in fantastic position to benefit. Here's what the virtual reality opportunity looks like over the next few years, as combined sales of hardware and software jump from under $5 billion in 2016 to an estimated $40 billion by 2020 . 
Image source: SuperData.
AMD's opportunity lies in its graphics cards for VR-ready computers, but also in its sales of GPUs for gaming consoles, like Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 4. Sony is shaping up to be a major player in the VR space. The company recently released its VR headset that's compatible with the PS4, PS4 Slim, and upgraded PS4 Pro, and it has already sold more than 50 million PS4 consoles to date. 
The company's new VR headset could help spur even more sales of the PS4 lineup, which would then boost sales of AMD's processors. With Sony teaming up with 230 developers and releasing new VR games and content, AMD is in the perfect position to benefit. 
While AMD has had a rough few years of falling revenue and discrete desktop GPU market share, the company appears to be making up for lost time. If it can can continue on this path -- and benefit from the rise of VR as well -- then AMD investors can expect another promising year from the company.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) made headlines on Monday with the introduction of Radeon Instinct, a line of GPU accelerators aimed specifically at deep learning systems. The company has offered products targeting data centers and high-performance computing for years with its FirePro graphics cards. But Radeon Instinct, along with the MIOpen open-source software that AMD announced alongside the new products, marks a shift in the company's strategy.

Image source: AMD.
Radeon Instinct will come in three flavors. The MI6 is based on AMD's Polaris GPU architecture, which powers the mainstream gaming graphics cards the company launched earlier this year. This card is aimed at neural network inference, where a trained neural network is used for an application. The MI8 is based on AMD's old Fiji architecture, featuring greater processing power and memory bandwidth, but a quarter of the memory. This card is also likely aimed at inference.
The MI25 is the big daddy of the bunch. Built around AMD's upcoming Vega GPU architecture, which will power the company's high-end gaming graphics cards next year, the MI25 offers a whopping 25 TFLOPs of half-precision floating-point performance. This card is aimed at neural network training, a more computationally intensive process than inference. For comparison, NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) P100 Tesla GPU clocks in at 21.2 TFLOPS in the best-case scenario, using the company's homegrown NVLink technology instead of standard PCIe.
Radeon Instinct products are expected to begin shipping during the first half of 2017. This news comes about one month after AMD scored a big data center win, with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google announcing that it would integrate the company's FirePro graphics cards into its cloud platform. Despite this apparent momentum, AMD remains far behind NVIDIA in the data center market generally and the A.I. acceleration market specifically. With additional competition from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)and even Google itself, it won't be smooth sailing for AMD.
NVIDIA has been talking about deep learning for years. The company's data center business is booming thanks to that early focus, closing in on a $1 billion annual run rate after tripling revenue year-over-year during the third quarter.

Image source: NVIDIA.
NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs are already offered by most of the major cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud. AMD's GPUs are absent from all three. Google will be adding NVIDIA's GPUs to its cloud platform along with AMD's, so while that announcement was a big win for AMD, it was also a win for NVIDIA.
According to an analyst at Nomura, NVIDIA enjoys an 80% share of the accelerator market. A vast amount of software has been ported to run on NVIDIA's GPUs, ranging from computational finance to scientific simulations, creating switching costs for those already using its products. The market for A.I. acceleration is still in its infancy, meaning that AMD is not incapable of catching up. But NVIDIA has a clear lead.
Intel has been trying to break into the accelerator market for years with its Xeon Phi line of products. The most recent, Knights Landing, has the advantage of acting as the main processor as well, offering customers potential costs savings. Intel stated earlier this year that it was aiming to move 100,000 units in 2016, a number that would make the product a major force in the accelerator market.
Intel is planning to launch a version of Xeon Phi, Knights Mill, aimed specifically at deep learning. Knights Mill will also feature the ability to act as the main processor when it launches next year, giving NVIDIA some serious competition in the A.I. acceleration market in addition to AMD's upcoming products.

Image source: Intel.
Google may pose a threat to all three companies in the long run. The search giant announced earlier this year that it had designed an application-specific-integrated-circuit in an effort to accelerate deep learnings tasks. Google is reportedly using more than 1,000 of the Tensor Processing Units in its data centers already.
In the same way that a GPU is more efficient than a CPU at graphics processing because it's designed at the hardware level for the kind of math involved, Google's TPU is more efficient than a GPU for inference because it's designed at the hardware level for that task. Google claims that its TPUs provide and order-of-magnitude improvement in performance per watt compared to GPUs.
AMD is playing catch up when it comes to deep learning. Like NVIDIA, AMD is betting that GPUs are the future of A.I. acceleration. But ASICs like Google's TPU could upend both companies' long-term plans. If other cloud computing vendors move to design their own custom chips for deep learning, the GPU vendors could be left out in the cold.
AMD's Radeon Instinct is the company's first real attempt at going after NVIDIA in the A.I. acceleration market. If the company can price the cards competitively, it could be a very profitable endeavor. But the threat of Intel is looming, and the potential for custom chips to eventually displace GPUs is very real. AMD investors should be happy that the company is taking deep learning seriously. But they also shouldn't get ahead of themselves.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 23.2% in November, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The big news during the month was an announcement from Alphabet's Google that it was installing both AMD and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs in its cloud data centers.
NVIDIA has had great success getting cloud computing companies to buy its pricey Tesla GPUs. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud already offer GPU cloud computing services via NVIDIA's products. Google's announcement, which will put AMD's FirePro S9300 x2 and two NVIDIA Telsa GPUs on offer through its cloud platform beginning next year, is a significant win for both companies.
NVIDIA's data center business is now at an annual run rate of nearly $1 billion, while AMD doesn't break out data center revenue. The opportunity for AMD is immense if the company can continue to win cloud computing deals. An analyst last month estimated that artificial intelligence offers a $15 billion opportunity for semiconductor companies. Even grabbing a fraction of that total would be a boon for AMD.
AMD stock has been on a tear this year, driven by growing optimism that the company is finally on the verge of turning things around. The launch of its mainstream Polaris graphics cards earlier this year has produced revenue growth in its core computing and graphics business, but the company remains unprofitable. Next year, AMD will launch new Zen CPUs and Vega high-end GPUs, both of which will need to be successful for the company to grow into its valuation.

AMD data by YCharts.
More good news in December has pushed shares of AMD even higher. A rumor emerged on Dec. 6 that AMD and Intel had signed a licensing agreement that would put AMD's GPU technology into Intel's CPUs. There's been no confirmation of any deal at this point, but it's possible that this deal will replace a cross-licensing agreement between Intel and NVIDIA that expires early next year. If that's the case, AMD could see annual payments from Intel. However, AMD graphics showing up in Intel CPUs seems unlikely.
2017 will be a big year for AMD, with the ultimate success of its turnaround set to be determined by the launch of new products. The Google deal in November was a positive, but the company remains far behind NVIDIA.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has been one of the best performing tech stocks this year, surging over 230% and crushing the NASDAQ's 8% gain. However, these five catalysts could drive the stock even higher in 2017.

Image source: AMD.
AMD's turnaround in 2016 was fueled by robust sales of its semi-custom SoCs (system on chips) for Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. That turned the EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit into its core pillar of growth, and offset declines at its Computing and Graphics unit. 
That shift boosted AMD's quarterly revenue by 8% annually during the second quarter this year (its first quarter of positive year-over-year growth in two years) and another 23% during the third quarter. That turnaround also lifted its non-GAAP earnings back into the black. Analysts now believe that AMD can finish this year with 6% sales growth, compared to a 28% decline in 2015. 
Console sales often wane after the first year, but Sony and Microsoft are both updating their consoles with slimmer form factors and beefier specs for 4K and VR gaming. These new versions should continue supporting AMD's EESC unit in 2017 and beyond.
Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive piqued consumer interest in high-end VR games for PCs, but many current PCs aren't powerful enough for those headsets. The initial batch of ""VR ready"" PCs cost around $1,000, but AMD reduced that price to about $600 with its RX 480 graphics cards.

The Rift and Vive are still pricey, with respective price tags of $600 and $800, but those prices should come down next year as component prices decline and competition from mobile and console-based headsets heats up. When that happens, demand for AMD's low-end ""VR ready"" cards could rise and finally help it push back against market leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, NVIDIA is also eyeing the same market with competitively priced VR ready cards like the GTX 1060.
AMD also plans to launch its next-gen Vega GPUs in the near future. Leaked specs indicate that the Vega 10 will boast 12 teraflops of processing power, which outperforms the 11 teraflops squeezed out by NVIDIA's $1,200 GTX Titan X. 
If AMD sticks with its strategy of selling cards at lower price points than NVIDIA, it might just win back some high-end users. But it's still a long road back -- research firm JPR claims that AMD controlled just 29% of the add-in board market in the third quarter, compared to NVIDIA's 71% share. NVIDIA also spent 44% more on R&D than AMD last quarter, indicating that it could quickly match the Vega challengers with its own next-gen chipsets.
Over the past few years, AMD was marginalized in the x86 CPU market by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD offered cheaper chips, but Intel's Core CPUs crushed AMD's in terms of single-threaded performance (which is crucial for high-end gaming). According to PassMark GPU benchmarks, Intel CPUs now account for 83% of the x86 market, while AMD CPUs account for 17%. That loss of market share, exacerbated by sluggish demand for PCs, caused AMD's x86 business to become a dead weight.
However, AMD doesn't plan to simply surrender this market to Intel. Its long-awaited Zen CPUs, which are scheduled to arrive early next year, promise to offer better single-threaded performance for game engines and improved multi-threaded performance for newer graphics APIs. Depending on how competitively they're priced against Intel's high-end Core i5 and i7 offerings, the Zen might help AMD finally regain some lost market share in the tough x86 market.
AMD is constantly cited as a potential takeover target for bigger chipmakers. Its enterprise value of $8.4 billion is fairly low compared to other chipmakers, and it's the only remaining licensee of x86 chips.
Intel, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Oracle, and even Microsoft were named as potential suitors before, but no concrete talks have ever emerged. With the semiconductor market consolidating rapidly and AMD's finances improving, a hostile bidding war could theoretically erupt over the chipmaker in the near future. If that happens, we could see some big premium offers since AMD only trades at 2 times sales. By comparison, Intel and Qualcomm respectively have P/S ratios of 3 and 4.
At the beginning of the year, I questioned AMD's ability to survive its market share losses, sales declines, and rising debt. But under CEO Lisa Su, the chipmaker wisely used robust growth in its EESC unit to support the development of new chipsets to challenge NVIDIA and Intel. While it will still be tough to reclaim market share from those bigger rivals, AMD has given investors fresh hope that its stock could keep rising over the next few years.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped on Thursday due to an analyst upgrade that featured a significant price target boost. The upgrade comes after a string of positive news for AMD, including a cloud computing deal and rumors of a licensing pact with Intel. The stock rose as much as 11.5% on the news of the upgrade, settling into an 8.3% gain by 2:30 p.m. EST
Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded AMD from underperform to buy on Thursday, citing turnaround progress and a massive opportunity ahead of it as it looks to challenge both Intel and NVIDIA. Success in semi-custom chips was also a factor in the upgrade. While AMD's core CPU and GPU business has been posting losses for quite some time, semi-custom chips powering all of the major game consoles have provided a much-needed source of revenue and profits for the company.
Merrill Lynch assigned a $12 price target to shares of AMD, with a $15-plus bull case target and a $7 bear case target. AMD stock has rocketed higher this year on the hope that its new GPU and CPU products would propel the company back to profitability. That hasn't happened yet, but Merrill Lynch sees a growth opportunity for the company that is ""too large to ignore.""

This is the third time in recent weeks that shares of AMD have surged on a positive piece of news. The stock jumped in mid-November when Alphabet's Google announced that it was adding both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs to its cloud platform. AMD is far behind NVIDIA when it comes to getting its server GPUs into cloud data centers, so the deal was a meaningful win for the company.
Another jump came earlier this week when a rumor emerged that AMD had signed a licensing deal with Intel to put its GPU technology into Intel processors. The deal has not yet been confirmed, and it may simply replace a licensing deal between Intel and NVIDIA that expires next year. An annual payment to AMD may be in the cards, but the prospect of Intel using AMD's GPUs in its processors seems unlikely.
A flurry of good news has pushed AMD stock higher in the past month. The company will need to deliver next year when it launches its Zen CPUs and Vega GPUs in order to justify its higher valuation.

Economist John Maynard Keynes is generally credited with the quote, ""When the facts change, I change my mind."" Today, it's Merrill Lynch (CAPS rating: 93.93) that is putting the quote into practice.
According to StreetInsider.com, it's been more than two years since Bank of America's Merrill Lynch brokerage unit downgraded semiconductor chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to underperform, assigning the stock a $4 price target on worries that the perpetually underperforming AMD just couldn't effectively compete with rivals such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Since that rating came out, however, AMD shares have not fallen, but instead climbed to nearly $10 as of this writing. And with this ""fact"" having changed, Merrill Lynch has decided to change its opinion of AMD stock today -- and upgraded the stock two notches, from underperform to buy.
Here are three things you need to know about that upgrade.
Merrill Lynch ponders the future of ""deep learning"" computers, and has a rethink about AMD stock. Image source: Getty Images.
In a rare mea culpa, Merrill Lynch admitted today that it missed out on the turnaround in AMD's business -- and in its stock price earlier this year.
Quoted on TheFly.com this morning, the banker explains that it was ""too concerned"" about AMD's history of ""weak execution, high debt, and competitive risks"" from Intel and NVIDIA. In focusing on the company's disappointing history, Merrill says it may have missed the unfolding story of AMD's rising strength in PC gaming, artificial intelligence, and computer deep learning. AMD's progress in these areas, says Merrill, has led to gains in chip market share for AMD.
At the same time, Merrill Lynch gives AMD's new CEO Lisa Su credit for shoring up AMD's balance sheet. With nearly $1.3 billion in cash on its books, S&P Global Market Intelligence data show that AMD has grown its cash reserves by roughly 25% since Merrill Lynch first downgraded it back in July of 2014. At the same time, AMD has shrunk its long-term indebtedness to just $1.6 billion.
Result: Cash on hand is nearly sufficient to balance out debt at AMD, and at the same time, says Merrill, AMD has succeeded in refinancing the debt it still carries, pushing out its due date and giving the firm breathing room as it continues to build cash.
Factoring all these improvements into consideration, Merrill Lynch says that the same AMD stock it previously thought to be worth only $4 is now worth three times more -- $12 a share. And with AMD stock still selling for less than $10 a share today, that means there's more than 20% upside in the stock.
But is Merrill Lynch right about that?
That's really hard to say, because while AMD's improvements are obvious, it's still not obvious that AMD stock is a better buy than Intel or NVIDIA, say.
Debt may be down and cash may be up, but S&P Global data show that AMD is still burning cash at the rate of $127 million a year. Under GAAP accounting standards, the stock looks even worse, with net losses of $548 million over the past 12 months. In contrast, both Intel and NVIDIA are GAAP-profitable companies, and both are generating not just positive free cash flow, but free cash flow actually superior to their reported GAAP profits -- $10.6 billion in FCF for Intel, and $1.2 billion for NVIDIA, over the past 12 months.
Long story short: I can't deny that AMD has made improvements in its business. I cannot say that Merrill Lynch is wrong when it peers into the future, sees these improvements continuing, and believes that despite its losses and despite its cash burn, AMD has a bright future ahead of it. All I can do is point to the multiple instances when other analysts have predicted similar turnarounds for AMD -- and been proven wrong.
AMD's financial picture looks a whole lot prettier today than it did just two years ago, but Intel and NVIDIA aren't sitting still, and AMD still has a long way to go to make up the gap between it and its more successful rivals. To cite another famous quote, I'm still not convinced that this leopard has changed its spots.

            ","With the market hovering near historic highs, it seems tough to find stocks with much upside potential. However, just because a stock surged over the past year doesn't mean that it will run out of steam next year. Let's take a look at three tech stocks which rallied in 2016 but might make investors even richer in 2017 -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), MeetMe (NASDAQ:MEET), and Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB).

Image source: Getty Images.
AMD seemed doomed earlier this year as its stock fell below $2. Intel was crushing its CPU business, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) was marginalizing its GPU business. But the chipmaker bounced back on the strength of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which produced SoCs for non-PC platforms like gaming consoles, including the PS4 and Xbox One.
Robust sales of those consoles helped AMD post 8% annual sales growth during its second quarter earnings in July -- marking its first quarter of positive year-over-year revenue growth in two years. It followed that up with 23% annual growth in the third quarter and a return to non-GAAP profitability. 
AMD is now fighting back against NVIDIA with new low-end ""VR ready"" GPUs, and its upcoming Vega chipset could challenge NVIDIA in the high-end market. It also plans to take on Intel's x86 dominance with its powerful new Zen CPUs early next year. AMD's success definitely isn't guaranteed in either market, but analysts believe that it could post 7% sales growth and a non-GAAP profit next year. If AMD can exceed those expectations, it could have much more room to run despite rallying over 220% in 2016.
MeetMe's social networking app helps users find new people to chat with. The small cap company, which acquired rival platform Skout earlier this year, had over 8.5 million monthly active users (MAUs) at the end of last quarter. That seems tiny compared to Match Group's Tinder, which has around 50 million MAUs, but MeetMe has a robust presence among millennials and is rapidly growing.

The app's mobile MAUs rose 32% year-over-year last quarter, and its mobile revenue soared 39% to $16 million. Total revenues, mainly generated by in-app ads, grew 20% to $17.2 million. Non-GAAP earnings rose 30% to $6.2 million, GAAP earnings surged 316% to $4.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA improved 31%. 
Analysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to respectively rise 38% and 17% next year. MeetMe already advanced nearly 40% this year, but it still trades at less than 7 times earnings, compared to the average P/E of 50 for internet information providers. MeetMe's growth might eventually peak, but I believe that its stock could still double or triple from current levels if its growth stays consistent. 
Carbonite offers cloud backup services for SMBs (small and medium sized businesses) with fewer than 300 employees. The cloud backup space might seem crowded, but market behemoths like Microsoft and IBM generally focus on large enterprises instead of SMBs. 
This enabled Carbonite -- which beefed up by acquiring Seagate's EVault cloud backup service in January -- to carve out a growing niche in the SMB market. Carbonite's revenue grew a whopping 50% annually to $51.9 million last quarter, and non-GAAP net income rose 80% to $3.8 million. The company also generated a slim GAAP net profit of $107,000, compared to a loss of nearly $6 million in the prior year quarter. Its adjusted free cash flow more than tripled to $4.5 million.
Much of Carbonite's growth this year was inflated by the EVault acquisition, but analysts still expect it to post 7% sales growth and 19% earnings growth next year. Carbonite already rallied nearly 90% this year, but it still trades at 27 times forward earnings -- which remains lower than its industry average of 29. 
AMD, MeetMe, and Carbonite all crushed the market in 2016, and they could continue to do so next year. However, all three companies face clear headwinds -- AMD's efforts against Intel and NVIDIA could flop, MeetMe could be crushed by Tinder, and Carbonite could be marginalized by its larger rivals. But if they overcome those challenges, these stocks could continue soaring and make investors very happy.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged on Tuesday after a rumor emerged that AMD and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had signed a deal involving AMD's Radeon graphics technology. AMD stock was up about 9.9% at 3 p.m. EST, while Intel stock was up about 1%.
The rumors of a deal between AMD and Intel first emerged in a forum post from Kyle Bennett, chief editor at HardOCP. According to Bennett, Intel is licensing AMD's graphics technology with plans to integrate it into future processors.
Intel and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) currently have a cross-licensing agreement that gives Intel access to some of NVIDIA's patents, but it expires in early 2017. There has been no news regarding a renewal of this agreement, and it's possible that Intel has instead signed a similar deal with AMD. It's unclear if the agreement, if it turns out to be more than a rumor, will involve cash payments.
Speculation that Intel will use AMD's GPU's in its processors is probably unfounded. The most likely scenario is that a deal between AMD and Intel is simply a replacement for the NVIDIA deal.
The jump in AMD's stock price is based on sparse rumors; nothing has been confirmed by anyone at this point. A deal may involve payments to AMD, which would shore up the company's balance sheet as it prepares to launch its Zen processors next year. But the idea that Intel is going to use AMD's GPUs in its processors seems far-fetched to me.
In any event, this is probably good news for AMD and, depending on the nature of the deal, bad news for NVIDIA. But we'll need to wait for more information to know for sure.

It's the classic story of David versus Goliath. Or, it used to be -- but things have been changing lately. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) aren't the unambiguous head-to-head rivals they used to be.
So, what's new in this storied matchup, and which stock should you buy today?
Let's find out.
If you're looking for massive market momentum, there is no contest, here. Intel has traded roughly in line with the S&P 500 over the last year, but AMD shares have tripled year to date and nearly quadrupled over the last 52 weeks.
Image source: AMD.
Of course, AMD started that climb from a deep, dark well.
Six years ago, AMD shares traded at $7.50 per share. The next five years saw AMD sliding 70% lower, landing at $2.22 in November, 2015. Revenues were plunging and the company was burning enormous amounts of cash. Weak PC sales and a soft market for video game consoles added up to bad news for AMD investors.
By 2015, it was not obvious that AMD would avoid a bankruptcy in the long run.
After a false start based on unproven buyout rumors, AMD started a real comeback in January. A solid fourth-quarter report was followed by three positive earnings surprises. The company launched an all-new graphics chip architecture to wide acclaim, and investors are looking forward to an equally radical redesign of AMD's PC processor cores in early 2017.
Once left for dead, AMD now looks like a vital business with a serious shot at revenue growth and steady profits. That's how the stock reached today's high levels.
From here, even the bulls think the stock looks fairly valued. Buy ratings are based on future revenue growth, not expanding valuation ratios. The upcoming launch of the Zen processor architecture will be a make-or-break moment for AMD. The company did a good job with the Polaris graphics platform, which improves the odds for a decent Zen introduction.
Still, AMD remains a risky bet until the company can get a truly solid financial footing again. Zen is going up against Intel's best server and desktop chips, and that's always a daunting challenge. At this point, I'm happy to stay on the sidelines and wait for the Zen introduction. Makes no sense to make a blind bet on a dark horse, after all.
If 2016 was a year of transition for AMD, the same was also true for Intel.
The chip giant reduced its headcount by 11% this year, then installed a new CFO and decided to spin off its security operations under the McAfee brand. Intel continued to exceed earnings estimates at every beat, but gloomy guidance led to a dramatic haircut in January.
Image source: Intel.
However, Intel is a far larger and more stable business than AMD. The last four quarters generated $10.5 billion of free cash flows, even though Intel is ramping up its capital expenses again. This company has the financial freedom to take chances and try out new markets without betting the entire farm.
The revamped strategy points to data center servers and the Internet of Things. The traditional PC market will continue to shrink, but Intel is making up for that drag with improvements in those two core markets.
Would I add more Intel shares to my existing holdings at today's prices? Maybe not. The stock is riding relatively high at the moment, just short of the multiyear highs Intel reached in October. For the moment, I'm happy to stick with the shares I already own.
That being said, I just might take another dip into Intel shares the next time this high-quality stock takes a sharp fall for no good reason. It happens more often than you'd think.
The high-stakes gamblers out there might want to take a deeper look at AMD. For the rest of us, Intel is the lower-risk way to go.

            ","A stock's value is not indicated by its market price. The profitability of a specific company compared with how many shares it has outstanding is what matters, meaning that a stock trading below $10 could be more valuable than a stock trading at $100 if there is more profitability per share to be expected in the future or some other benefit such as high dividend yield.
That said, sometimes there is value to be found in looking at stocks that have been beaten up by the market and could still have the potential for future gains. Here are few of those downtrodden stocks that could make nice little positions in a diversified portfolio.  
Fitbit Inc. (NYSE:FIT) stock was crushed in late October, when the company's disappointing Q3 earnings report guided for a lousy fourth quarter, a time when holiday sales usually mean upward revisions. For the third quarter itself, even though sales grew 23% year over year, net income was cut nearly in half, and sales growth was far slower than in years past.
Image source: Fitbit.
However, while those figures look grim, the company is still the global leader in wearables, and its market share ticked slightly upward in the most recent figures from the IDC, the leading source of wearables market share data. Fitbit's new products have all been more or less upgrades to its basic product, a wrist-based tracker, but the company has begun to massively increase spending on research and development, which was up more than 150% in Q3 year over year, and could mean future products that help diversify revenue. Additionally, Fitbit looks to be one of the best suited to take advantage of the growing trend of companies and insurers using fitness tracking to try to decrease employee health insurance costs.
Annaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY) just barely makes the cut-off for this list, after a small decline since August has dropped the stock to around $10. Annaly deals mostly in mortgage-backed securities or other real estate-related investment securities, but it has the ability to venture into new kinds of investments, which has helped to diversify its portfolio, and now has around $8 billion in holdings. Though the stock price has been pressured recently, Annaly is one of the biggest in its field, and its 20-year history means it's probably adequately prepared to weather current global macro conditions.   
What makes this stock especially attractive is its incredible dividend yield at over 10%. Though the most recent quarterly dividend of $0.26 is a slight drop from $0.30 over the past three years, that seems to be partially because Annaly is in the process of acquiring another company, so there doesn't seem to be much concern that the dividend will continue to be cut. 
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the key competitors in the circuit board and microchip market that's powering some of the most exciting industries such as autonomous cars, artificial intelligence, and more. Though much smaller than some of its big-name rivals in this space, AMD is still likely to gain from a vastly expanding industry. 
Shares of AMD rose nearly 10% in the last week, after the company announced a deal with Alphabet's Google, which plans to add AMD's Radeon-based FirePro server GPUs to its cloud platform in 2017, a major win for the company since it helps it to compete with bigger rivals already partnered with other big names in the cloud computing space. 
Like many energy companies, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) shares have been hammered in the past two years, as low oil prices and other macro or geopolitical forces have hurt the business. Chesapeake's shares had fallen from around $28 in 2013 to just $1.59 per share in February of this year. The stock has ticked up since then, which could be the start of stabilization in the industry and a rebound for those companies best positioned in it. Chesapeake and the entire energy industry could go through an interesting transition as Donald Trump takes office in January, following campaign promises to ""unleash America's $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves.""
Image source: Chesapeake
Chesapeake explores for and develops sources of natural gas and oil and also provides midstream services for other producers. In its most recent quarter, revenue was down 33% year over year, but its earnings per share of $0.09 beat expectations of a $0.03 loss. At an investor day in October, Chesapeake management revised its production guidance upward 5% to 15% annually through 2020. Note, however, that the company remains highly leveraged and that could drag on future growth.  
WisdomTree (NASDAQ:WETF) is an ETF provider that, since its inception in 2006, has grown to sponsor 94 distinct ETFs that span asset classes and countries around the world. Over the past year, certain negative market trends, particularly in Japan and Europe, have hurt the company's earnings and stock price.
However, things look good for WidsomTree going forward, including new products being launched such as ""smart beta fixed income,"" as well as ETFs focused on new geographies. While the company weathers current market trends, the stock could be cheap for a well-performing company. Most recently, WisdomTree acquired a 36% equity interest in AdvisorEngine (formerly known as Vanare), which is a digital wealth management platform that enables individual customization of portfolios.
What do all of these stocks have in common? They've all been generally unloved by the market, and their stock prices have consequently been pushed into this low price range. For that, there could be some value left in them for unexpected growth -- but be careful, as these will certainly be riskier than other options.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged for the second day in a row on Thursday following the announcement that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google planned to integrate AMD's server GPUs into its cloud platform. AMD stock was up about 9.5% at 3:30 p.m. EST, adding to a gain of nearly 10% on Wednesday.
Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) already has a presence at most of the major cloud-computing vendors, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and IBM's cloud platform. For AMD, the Google deal marks the second significant cloud win for the company in recent months, following a deal that will put its GPUs into Alibaba's cloud.
The Google deal represents progress for AMD, which has failed to capitalize on the growing trend of GPUs being used in the data center to the same extent as NVIDIA. NVIDIA's data center business is booming, with revenue tripling during the third quarter, to $240 million. AMD doesn't break out its data center GPU sales.
While some optimism is warranted due to this deal, Google is also adding NVIDIA GPUs to its cloud platform. This move fits in with Google's general push to make its cloud platform heterogeneous, not dependent on any single vendor. The company is working on developing a server based on IBM's POWER9 CPU, for example. Supporting both major GPU vendors makes sense given this strategy.
A recent note from analyst Ian Ing estimates that artificial intelligence could be a $15 billion opportunity for chip companies by 2025. NVIDIA is singled out as having an advantage in this area, while AMD is considered ""too resource constrained to fully address the opportunity."" With AMD fighting to win back market share in the GPU and CPU markets on a research and development budget that has been slashed over the past few years, that concern seems valid.
The Google cloud deal is certainly good news for AMD. But a 20% move in two days is hard to justify.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged on Wednesday, with the stock up 11.2% at its peak. News that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google plans to add AMD's Radeon-based FirePro server GPUs to its cloud platform in 2017 seems to be the main driver. The stock had settled a bit by 2:45 p.m. EST, up about 9.25%.
AMD is playing catch-up to rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) when it comes to cloud computing. NVIDIA has been focused on getting its Telsa GPUs into cloud data centers for years, and the company recently announced a blowout third quarter featuring a tripling of its data-center revenue. NVIDIA's GPUs are already available for users of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and IBM's cloud platform.
Beginning in 2017, AMD's FirePro S9300 x2 server GPUs, the company's most powerful, will be used to accelerate Google Compute Engine and Google Cloud Machine Learning services. Possible use cases include medical and financial simulations, machine learning, and video rendering and transcoding.
""The adoption of AMD GPU technology in Google Cloud Platform is a validation of the progress AMD has made in GPU hardware and our Radeon Open Compute Platform, which is the only fully open source hyperscale GPU compute platform in the world today,"" Said Raja Koduri, SVP and chief architect, Radeon Technologies Group, AMD. ""We expect that our momentum in GPU computing will continue to accelerate with future hardware and software releases and advances in the ecosystem of middleware and libraries.""
It's important to note that Google will also be adding NVIDIA's Tesla P100 and K80 GPUs to its cloud platform next year, so this isn't bad news for NVIDIA. For AMD, it represents tangible progress in the company's effort to become a major player in the accelerator market. NVIDIA's GPUs remain far more prevalent among cloud-computing providers, but this is a step in the right direction for AMD.
Still, a 10% jump in the stock price seems excessive. No details on the quantity of GPUs were given, so it's unclear exactly how big of a deal this is. Given Google's choice to add GPUs from both companies, this is as much a win for NVIDIA as it is for AMD.

Polaris was supposed to be a big deal for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The RX 480, launched in late June, and the RX 470 and RX 460, launched in August, went after the mainstream portion of the graphics card market aggressively. After losing substantial market share to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past few years and watching its graphics and computing segment plunge into the red, AMD bet on Polaris to begin its comeback.
The situation did improve for AMD during the third quarter. The computing and graphics segment, which includes graphics cards as well as PC CPUs, posted year-over-year revenue growth of about 11%, driven by higher GPU sales. The segment was still unprofitable, but less so compared to the prior-year period.
Unfortunately for AMD, this progress has been completely overshadowed by NVIDIA's blowout third quarter. Revenue grew 54% year over year, with gaming revenue surging 63%. Pascal-based graphics cards, including the GTX 1080, GTX 1070, and GTX 1060, led the way to a record quarter for NVIDIA.
It's important to put the numbers in perspective. NVIDIA's gaming segment, which doesn't include GPUs used for professional or data center applications, generated $1.24 billion of revenue during the third quarter. AMD's computing and graphics segment, which includes gaming GPUs, professional GPUs, and PC processors, produced just $472 million of revenue. The change in NVIDIA's gaming revenue compared to the prior-year period -- $483 million -- was greater than the revenue produced by AMD's core business.
Even before NVIDIA reported its results, there were some bad signs for AMD. The company cut prices on its two lower-end Polaris graphics cards following NVIDIA's announcement of the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti in October. Those cards, priced at $109 and $139, went directly after the RX 460 and RX 470 from AMD, effectively ending AMD's time as the leader in the mainstream portion of the market.
Another data point that suggests that Polaris is falling short comes from Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform. According to Steam's survey data, the RX 480 was owned by just 0.28% of Steam users in October, making it less than one-fourth as popular as NVIDIA's GTX 1070, which is substantially more expensive. None of AMD's other Polaris-based graphics cards registered on the survey at all.
Polaris represents just one part of AMD's turnaround strategy. In 2017, the company plans to launch high-end Vega graphics cards aimed at competing with NVIDIA's high-end offerings, as well as new Zen CPUs. Vega is expected to offer gamers an alternative to NVIDIA's high-end Pascal graphics cards, while Zen promises major performance gains that could drive share gains in the PC and server CPU markets.
If Polaris is any indication, though, investors may want to dial back their expectations. AMD's mainstream graphics strategy sounded great on paper, but execution has been disappointing. NVIDIA's gaming business is accelerating, despite the much-hyped launch of Polaris.
One major contributing factor to AMD's troubles is the company's shrinking research and development (R&D) budget. Just $947 million went toward R&D in 2015, down from $1.2 billion in 2013. Slashing R&D spending has helped bring the company closer to profitability, but expecting AMD to be able to close its technological gap with NVIDIA while spending far less on R&D may be unrealistic. For comparison, NVIDIA spent $1.33 billion on R&D in 2015, despite its narrower focus on graphics.
AMD's task only becomes more difficult going forward, with the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti now widely available. If Polaris-based graphics cards could only drive middling growth while facing little direct competition, it's hard to imagine growth accelerating now that NVIDIA has a strong mainstream presence.

            ","Many investors generally see stocks tripling as a long-term goal. But some stocks can also triple within a single year. Let's examine three tech stocks which tripled investors' investments over the past year, and whether or not they still have room to run. 

Image source: Getty Images.
If you had bought shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) when the stock dipped below $2 per share in February, you would have more than tripled your initial investment in just nine months. That's because the chipmaker staged a remarkable turnaround over the past year on the strength of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which was bolstered by robust sales of its semi-custom SoC for PS4s and Xbox Ones. Those sales are expected to keep rising on console upgrades like the PS4 Slim, PS4 Pro, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio.
In the second quarter this year, AMD posted its first quarter of annual revenue growth since 2014. It followed up that 9% growth with 23% growth in the third quarter, and anticipates 6% sales growth for the full year. AMD returned to quarterly GAAP profitability during the second quarter, and non-GAAP profitability during the third quarter.
AMD is also pushing back against Nvidia in the low-end ""VR ready"" GPU market with the Polaris-based RX 480, and plans to target the high-end market with its next-gen Vega GPUs in the near future. Although AMD remains a distant underdog to Intel in the CPU market, it plans to counter the market leader with its upcoming Zen CPUs.
Oclaro (NASDAQ:OCLR) is a manufacturer of optical components, modules, and subsystems for the service provider, enterprise, and data center markets. If you had bought shares of Oclaro last October when it hovered around $2, you would have quadrupled your initial investment. 
Oclaro directly benefits from the rising bandwidth needs of streaming video, cloud computing, application virtualization, and other data-intensive applications. That rising demand boosted its revenue by 55% annually last quarter, compared to 52% growth in the previous quarter and a 2% decline in the prior-year quarter. Most of that growth was fueled by growth in its ""100G and beyond"" portfolio of high-speed solutions, where sales rose roughly 20% annually for the fifth straight quarter.
On the bottom line, Oclaro's non-GAAP net income rose from a net loss of $1.6 million to net income of $20 million between the first quarters of 2015 and 2016. It also reported GAAP net income of $3.4 million during the quarter, versus a loss of $3.5 million a year ago. Analysts expect that growth to continue, with revenue and non-GAAP earnings expect to respectively rise 44% and 206% this year.
Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), commonly referred to as ""China's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR),"" has more than tripled in value since last October. That explosive growth can be attributed to its rapid growth in monthly active users (MAUs), which grew 33% annually to 282 million last quarter, compared to 36% growth in the prior-year quarter. The company -- which is owned by online media giant Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) -- has posted triple and double-digit sales growth in every quarter since its IPO in April 2014, and analysts expect its sales to rise 33% this year, compared to 43% growth in 2015.
Those numbers are enormous when compared to Twitter's anemic 3% year-over-year growth in MAUs and projected sales growth of 15% this year. Weibo is also profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP metrics, while Twitter is only profitable on a non-GAAP basis. Between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016, Weibo's GAAP net income rose from $4.2 million to $25.9 million, while its non-GAAP net income surged from $10.9 million to $35.5 million. Analysts expect its non-GAAP net income to more than double this year.
Weibo's advertising and marketing revenue rose 45% annually last quarter, fueled by ad buys from small and medium sized businesses nearly doubling. It offers display ads, interest-based ad campaigns, event-based ad campaigns, and promoted feeds. Weibo's new live streaming platform, which allows viewers to buy virtual gifts from the company for their favorite broadcasters, is also boosting its revenue growth.
Investors should always remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. However, AMD is still in turnaround mode, while Oclaro and Weibo still seem to be firing on all cylinders. Therefore, I believe that these stocks could still have room to run, despite having more than tripled investors' cash over the past year.

Pop quiz: What do you get when a company's stock rises 228% in a year while it also loses $548 million over this same period?
My answer: A precarious valuation.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been on an incredible tear over the past 12 months:

AMD data by YCharts.
As you'll see below, some of the newfound optimism bolstering AMD stock is deserved. However, the extent of a yearlong rally has also driven AMD shares to heights that the company's underlying business fundamentals seem unlikely to support, and investors eyeing AMD shares today should do so with extreme caution.
Advanced Micro Devices occupies something of a precarious place in the eyes of many longtime semiconductor sector observers. Long the distant second fiddle to Intel in the market for the x86 microprocessors that power the PC industry,  AMD has struggled to maintain consistent profitability since the turn of the millennium, which has had disastrous results for its volatile stock price over the long term.

AMD Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.
In recent years, though, AMD experienced something of an unexpected renaissance. The growth in graphics-intensive computing tasks related to self-driving cars, big-data imaging, virtual reality, and even high-end video games drove a surge in demand for the graphics chips made by AMD and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).
The two GPU specialists differ in one essential characteristic: NVIDIA has traditionally occupied the high-end, high-performance piece of the market, while AMD has offered more affordable, mass-market chipsets. And its status as the everyman's GPU maker has proven to be an especially large benefit to AMD today. For example, it recently introduced the first $200 GPU -- the Radeon RX 480 -- a feat that could help lower the cost a VR-quality computer to around $600. Since the cost of many VR-ready PCs can run well into the thousands of dollars, a compelling mix of price and performance has fueled market-share gains for AMD in the market for PC graphics chips, even as the market for PC GPUs as a whole continues to decline. To counter this success, AMD's rival NVIDIA recently introduced its own $200 graphics chip design, the GeForce GTX 1060, and it's this kind of behavior that may threaten AMD's prospects in PC graphics chips. The broader implication here is that NVIDIA is willing to devalue its traditional high-end chips to defend its market share, and that doesn't bode well for AMD's continued surge in this space.
AMD has also been able to translate its abilities in both CPUs and GPUs to create single systems on a chip (SoCs) that can handle most core computing tasks for video game consoles like the Microsoft Xbox One and Sony PS4. The company indeed deserves credit from investors here: It appears to have established a profitable niche in console SoCs. However, despite AMD's clear opportunities and recent successes, shares have ventured into the realm of the overvalued.
AMD's business has indeed improved, but its soaring stock price seems difficult to justify, even looking to the medium term. For context, AMD's current lack of profits this year and its expectation for continued losses next year give it negative current and forward price-to-earnings ratios. Looking further to other commonly used valuation metrics, AMD's enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is also quite high at 236.
The common thread should jump out here. AMD's expected lack of profitability this year and next year doesn't inspire a lot of faith that the company can sustain a $6.8 billion market capitalization. To be sure, a large portion of AMD's current-year losses stem from the $340 million charge related to its amended chip-fabrication deal with its former manufacturing arm GlobalFoundries. However, this one-time charge doesn't affect AMD's profit outlook for next year. Thus, its continued estimated losses make me question whether investors are willing to wait until 2018 for profits to appear.
To be sure, AMD has done a great job tapping into the newfound demand for gaming-quality graphics chips. However, NVIDIA's ability to move down-market in that area adds a clear element of risk to AMD's ability to continue to steal market share. What's more, as console gaming platforms seem likely to vie with PCs as virtual reality gaming platforms, it seems possible that AMD's two core revenue growth catalysts could find themselves in direct competition in the years to come.
The overall point is that AMD's stock rebound has certainly been justified -- to a degree. However, given the company's plausible lack of near-term profits and its positive but evolving competitive position, a continued rise in AMD stock seems unlikely in my estimation.

Shares of graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) surged on Friday following the release of its third-quarter report, which blew past expectations. Both revenue and earnings came in well ahead of estimates, driven by the strength of its Pascal graphics cards, and the company's guidance was far better than expected. At 10:45 a.m. EST, the stock was up about 24%.
NVIDIA reported third-quarter revenue of $2 billion, up 54% year over year and a whopping $310 million higher than the average analyst estimate. The main driver was NVIDIA's gaming products, which generated $1.24 billion of revenue, up 63% year over year. NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards have been a major success, aided by a lack of competition at the high end of the market from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
NVIDIA's other segments produced growth as well. Professional product revenue grew 9% to $207 million, data center revenue grew 193% to $240 million, and automotive revenue grew 61% to $127 million. Gaming still accounts for the bulk of NVIDIA's sales, but the company is rapidly diversifying beyond that market.
Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.94, up 104% year over year and $0.37 higher than analyst expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin improved by 270 basis points year over year to 59.2%, while non-GAAP operating margin jumped to 35.3%, up from 23.6% during the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased by just 11% year over year, facilitating the massive earnings increase.
NVIDIA's fourth-quarter guidance didn't disappoint. The company expects to produce revenue of $2.1 billion, plus or minus 2%, with a non-GAAP gross margin of 59.2%. Analysts were expecting revenue guidance of just $1.69 billion. The company also announced that it plans to return a total of $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends in fiscal 2017, and $1.25 billion in fiscal 2018.
Despite AMD launching its anticipated Polaris graphics cards at the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA's gaming business is only getting stronger. The GTX 1060 launched in July, followed by the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti in October. Both challenge AMD in the mainstream portion of the market, and by all indications they have been successful for NVIDIA.
The data center segment nearly tripled its revenue, astonishing performance that suggests that NVIDIA's intense focus on deep learning is paying off. The auto segment also posted impressive results, with the business buoyed by recent news that Tesla had adopted NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 platform for all of its cars going forward.
NVIDIA's results continue to impress, and the company showed no signs of slowing down during the third quarter. A couple of post-earnings analyst upgrades have pushed price targets for the stock up to $95, and investors are doing their part driving the stock price higher.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a non-GAAP profit during its latest quarter, a vast improvement over recent quarters. But on a GAAP basis, the company posted a massive $406 million net loss. The discrepancy was mostly due to a $340 million charge that AMD took related to its wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries. The GAAP numbers include this charge; the non-GAAP numbers don't.
Companies report non-GAAP figures in an effort to give investors a number that better reflects their true performance. Unfortunately, many companies back out recurring costs like stock-based compensation, a practice which I strongly disagree with. Backing out one-time costs, like the wafer supply agreement charge, is often a reasonable thing to do. But when a pattern of ""one-time"" costs begins to emerge, investors should think twice about accepting those non-GAAP numbers.
That $340 million wafer supply agreement charge was the biggest one-time cost that AMD has reported in the past few years, but it certainly wasn't the only one. Between the beginning of 2014 and the third quarter of this year, AMD has taken 15 different one-time charges, with a whopping total of nearly $1.1 billion.

Data source: AMD quarterly reports.
All of these charges, with the exception of the inventory writedown in 2015, were backed out by AMD when calculating non-GAAP earnings. Many companies take restructuring charges, but when restructuring becomes a recurring theme, I don't think it's reasonable to ignore those costs any longer.
Even that big wafer supply agreement charge isn't truly a one-time cost. AMD took a massive $703 million charge related to that agreement back in 2012. One reason for the charge: ""GLOBALFOUNDRIES waived the exclusivity arrangement for AMD to manufacture certain 28nm APU products at GLOBALFOUNDRIES for a specified period.""
What was the reason for the $340 million charge during the third-quarter of this year? The new agreement ""Provides AMD with the flexibility to manufacture certain products with another wafer foundry."" That sounds awfully familiar.
Many companies take all sorts of charges and back them out of their non-GAAP figures. AMD is certainly not unique in that sense. But when these charges seem to repeat themselves, it becomes difficult to argue that they're truly ""one-time.""
None of this says anything about AMD's ongoing turnaround efforts. The company has made clear progress, with both of its segments growing sales during the third quarter. Its Polaris graphics cards have put the company in a far better position than it was in last year, although NVIDIA remains dominant with its Pascal graphics cards. The semi-custom business got a boost with new, high-end game consoles that launched this year. And Zen is coming in 2017.
But as we go forward, remember that AMD has a long history of one-time charges. Its non-GAAP numbers must be taken without a grain of salt.

            ","With the market hovering near all-time highs, it might seem tough to find stocks with significant upside potential from current levels. But for investors willing to take a risk on more beaten-down or volatile plays, these three picks might double within the next few years -- Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).

Image source: Getty Images.
Twilio's cloud platform links popular apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Uber, and Airbnb to users' phone numbers. Its service lets users add contacts, send text messages, or call each other via their phone numbers within an app. That feature is tough for a developer to create and scale up on its own, so it's generally more convenient, economical, and reliable to subscribe to Twilio's platform.
Growing demand for Twilio's services boosted its revenue by 62% annually to $71.5 million last quarter, and its active customer accounts grew 45%. Twilio expects its revenue to rise 61%-62% for the full year, compared to 88% growth in 2015. Twilio still isn't profitable, but its non-GAAP net losses narrowed last quarter.
Twilio's core business looks promising, but it's been on a roller-coaster ride since its IPO in late June. It initially surged from its IPO price of $15 to nearly $70 by late September, inflating its price-to-sales ratio into the high 20s. Twilio then announced a secondary offering in early October, triggering a massive sell-off that knocked the stock back to the low $30s. But now that Twilio's P/S ratio has cooled off to 12, and short interest has surged to 50% as of Oct. 25, I believe that the stock is poised for a rebound.
Cybersecurity company CyberArk is the market leader in the PAM (privileged account management) market. Its platform protects companies from internal threats, like disgruntled employees, by locking down compromised computers before they impact the rest of the network. 

Image source: Getty Images.
CyberArk doesn't face much competition in this market because most cybersecurity companies focus on external threats with next-gen firewalls and threat detection systems. Yet a report from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Security last September found that 43% of data breaches were actually caused internally. 
As a result, rising demand for CyberArk's services boosted its revenue 37% annually to $55 million last quarter. CyberArk expects its revenue to rise 33%-34% for the full year, compared to 56% growth in 2015. Unlike many other cybersecurity firms, CyberArk is profitable on a GAAP basis. Its GAAP net income rose 4% to $7.1 million last quarter, while its non-GAAP net income improved 28% to $11.8 million.
Despite those strong numbers, CyberArk stock has stayed almost flat over the past 12 months due to concerns about its slowing sales growth, weak enterprise spending, and its high valuations (8.5 times sales and 62 times earnings). However, the rising number of data breaches worldwide could continue boosting CyberArk's top and bottom line growth for years to come. With an enterprise value of just $1.2 billion, CyberArk could also be a lucrative takeover target for larger cybersecurity, networking, or IT companies.
It might seem greedy to believe that chipmaker AMD, which already rallied 200% over the past 12 months, could still double from its current price. However, the stock remains fairly cheap with a P/S ratio of 1.4, which is much lower than Intel's ratio of 2.7 and Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) ratio of 6.7.
AMD stock has been rising on the growth of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which is mainly supported by its sales of custom SoCs for the PS4 and Xbox One. New versions of these consoles -- like the PS4 Pro, PS4 Slim, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio -- will require even more AMD chips. AMD has also been pushing hard against Nvidia in the ""VR ready"" GPU market with low-cost GPUs like the RX 480. Looking ahead, AMD's next-gen Vega GPUs and Zen CPUs could help it narrow its performance gaps with Nvidia's high-end GPUs and Intel's high-end CPUs.
Back in July, AMD posted 9% annual sales growth for its second quarter, marking its first year-over-year sales growth in two years. It followed that up with 23% sales growth in the third quarter, and is on track to grow its annual sales by 6% for 2016 -- compared to a 28% decline in 2015. AMD remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis, but it squeezed out a non-GAAP profit of $27 million last quarter. If that bottom line improvement continues, AMD's price might head back to the double-digits within the next few years.
Twilio, CyberArk, and AMD all have upside potential, but they are also fairly risky plays which shouldn't be considered core investments. I personally own both Twilio and CyberArk, but only as minor positions designated as ""higher risk, higher reward"" plays. These stocks could certainly double over the long term, but I also wouldn't be surprised if they were cut in half during a market downturn.

During the third quarter, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported strong sales of its new Polaris graphics cards. The company's computing and graphics segment, which includes GPUs as well as CPUs, grew revenue by 11% year over year, with the launch of Polaris more than offsetting weak demand for desktop processors. The segment still posted a loss, but a far smaller one compared to the same period last year.
Market leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be reporting its third-quarter results on Nov. 10. The company's guidance calls for substantial revenue growth, no doubt driven by strong sales of its Pascal GPUs. With both AMD's Polaris and NVIDIA's Pascal driving growth, it can be difficult to parse whether AMD is gaining any ground on its rival. One piece of data suggests that NVIDIA's dominant position remains intact.
Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform operated by Valve, collects data on the hardware configurations of its users and provides monthly updates as part of its hardware and software survey. I've written before about NVIDIA's dominance on Steam. The GTX 970, launched in 2014, remains the most widely used graphics card on the platform, with the GTX 960 and GTX 750 Ti rounding out the top three. AMD fails to crack the top 15.
The data from Steam aren't perfect. Participation in the survey is optional, and it's unclear whether that creates any sort of bias. The data don't tell us much about the PC market as a whole. But I think it's reasonably representative of the PC gaming market, thus giving us a window into trends occurring in the industry.
The only Polaris graphics card that shows up on the list is the RX 480, the highest-end card that AMD has launched so far. The RX 470 and RX 460 have yet to show up on the list, but they were launched more than a month later.
In October, the RX 480 accounted for 0.28% of graphics cards in use on the Steam platform, according to the survey data. The card faced availability issues early on, which may have depressed the numbers a bit. But NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards were also in short supply upon launch.
NVIDIA launched its GTX 1080 and GTX 1070, both far more expensive than the RX 480, about a month earlier than AMD's debut Polaris card. The GTX 1060 came in late July, a few weeks after the RX 480 became available. All three cards have easily surpassed the RX 480 on Steam.
Graphics Card

GTX 1060
1.03%
GTX 1080
0.75%
RX 480
0.28%
Data source: Steam hardware and software survey.
The conclusion I draw from these data is that Polaris has not been a runaway success for AMD. These new cards are driving year-over-year growth, but it's important to remember that AMD's graphics market share was near its lowest point during the third quarter of 2015. It would have been shocking if Polaris wasn't producing significant year-over-year revenue growth, given the comparison.
There's no question that AMD's lineup of graphics cards is more competitive today than it was a year ago. But, at least on Steam, NVIDIA's grip on the market doesn't seem to be loosening. AMD will launch higher-end Vega graphics cards next year, and that may help the company win back share at the high end. But for now, NVIDIA remains king.

With their stocks soaring in the last year, it's been an incredible time to be a shareholder of semiconductor stocks NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).

AMD data by YCharts.
To see which stock looks like the better buy going forward, though, let's examine AMD's and NVIDIA's stock histories, the financial trends underpinning their recent rises, and the long-term outlook for their respective businesses to see which stock remains the better buy today.
WIth the stock tripling in the past 12 months alone, investors clearly see a major opportunity ahead for AMD. As longtime second fiddles to rival Intel in the PC CPU market, AMD and NVIDIA have benefited mightily from a resurgence of interest in graphics-intensive computing in a number of markets. Specifically, AMD's move deeper into semi-custom graphics chips that ship into video game consoles has proven to be a boon for the company of late. Case in point: Revenue from its semi-custom chip segment increased about 5% in AMD's most recent quarter. However, I'm not so sure the rally in AMD stock can sustain itself.
Looking to the bigger picture, several red flags emerge in AMD's business model that could conceivably reverse the recent GPU market share gains it has achieved. For starters, there is increasing competition in graphics chips, since NVIDIA -- traditionally the high-end vendor in the GPU market -- recently launched its GeForce GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti chips. These chips target the lower-cost segment of the market where AMD has recently been able to eke out some market share gain. The company's balance sheet isn't particularly impressive, either. AMD carries about $3.3 billion in total assets, compared to $2 billion in long-term debt. This isn't an acute issue, but interest payments on its debts do create one more headwind for a company still struggling to switch to profitability -- which is by no means the case for NVIDIA .

Image source: NVIDIA.
NVIDIA shares many of the same opportunities as AMD, but the company's long-held status as the premier graphics processing chipmaker has allowed it to branch this specialization into a number of emerging growth areas -- and to do so better than its rival.
The rise of competitive gaming is one area that few -- myself included -- expected to grow into a major business, but NVIDIA's wares have become the leading chip for the professional gaming industry, which favors the computing power of PCs over consoles. Self-driving cars also serve as another emerging source of significant opportunity for NVIDIA, since they use many external sensors to gauge their surroundings and behave accordingly. Strange as it may sound, discerning in real time whether the object next to it is a person riding a bike or a car requires a tremendous amount of graphics processing power, for which NVIDIA has also created a series of turnkey solutions. NVIDIA enjoys a similar opportunity in big data and AI visualization, but by now, hopefully you see a trend. The general direction of computing and technology is toward more graphics-intensive activities, and NVIDIA stands to be the beneficiary of this movement, perhaps more than any other company.
Equally compelling is the fact that NVIDIA is also profitable and enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its 47 times P/E ratio makes the company about twice as expensive as the broader market. However, given the generational nature of some of NVIDIA's opportunities, the company could easily outgrow that valuation for investors willing to hold its stock over the long term.
Hopefully, the likely winner in this scenario is abundantly clear. NVIDIA has the better business model, technological leadership, and a stronger balance sheet, and it has already achieved profitability. What's more, NVIDIA's move into some areas that have driven AMD's recent success threatens to derail AMD's growth story before the company can flip to profitability.
Here, the conclusion is obvious. NVIDIA is the better semiconductor stock for investors to buy today.

In an effort to win back lost market share, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) aimed its Polaris graphics architecture at the mainstream portion of the market. The RX 480, priced at $199 or $239 depending on the memory configuration, launched at the end of June. The RX 470, priced at $179, launched in early August, as did two variants of the RX 460, priced at $109 and $139. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) went in the opposite direction with its Pascal GPUs, targeting the high-end first.
This strategy made a lot of sense for AMD, which had seen its unit share of the graphics card market bottom out below 20% last year. The company made some progress on the market share front prior to Polaris' launch, but these new graphics cards will ultimately determine whether AMD will be able to claw its way back to a strong No. 2 position in the industry.
AMD's plan hit a bit of a snag in October. NVIDIA launched the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti on Oct. 25, priced at $109 and $139, respectively. This marked Pascal's maiden voyage into the low-end of the market, providing competition to AMD's cheaper Polaris graphics cards.
In response to the launch, AMD slashed the official prices on the RX 460 and RX 470. The RX 460 now starts at $100, while the RX 470 goes for $170. It will take time for actual prices at retailers to reflect these changes, but it's clear from these price cuts that NVIDIA was more aggressive than AMD was expecting.
According to Tom's Hardware, the GTX 1050 soundly beats the RX 460 in nearly every benchmark, often by a significant margin. To AMD's credit, the performance gap is much smaller in games using either DirectX 12 or Vulkan. But in older games, NVIDIA's card dominates. Given that the GTX 1050 launched at the same price as the RX 460, it makes sense that AMD was quick to lower the price. At the same price, NVIDIA's offering is the clear winner.
The GTX 1050 Ti isn't nearly as disruptive, filling the gap between the GTX 1050 and AMD's RX 470. But the RX 470 has issues of its own. PC World, in its review, called the RX 470 ""a great graphics card with a terrible price."" At a launch price of $179, the gap between the RX 470 and the higher-end RX 480 simply wasn't big enough. The $10 price cut makes the RX 470 a bit more compelling, so we'll have to wait and see if the new price point drives demand.
AMD's reign as the undisputed leader in the mainstream portion of the graphics card market only lasted a few months. NVIDIA's new Pascal cards, particularly the GTX 1050, are sure to make AMD's goal of winning back market share significantly more difficult. This isn't the first time that NVIDIA has forced AMD's hand on prices. Back in late 2014, NVIDIA's launch of the GTX 970 and GTX 980 prompted major price cuts on AMD's flagship graphics cards. That launch marked the beginning of NVIDIA's robust market share gains over the next year.
Beyond the mainstream market, AMD won't be launching higher-end Vega graphics cards until the first half of next year. NVIDIA's high-end Pascal graphics cards face no real competition at the moment, and it could be another six months before AMD finally provides an alternative.
Reactive price cuts, particularly so soon after launch, are never a good sign. NVIDIA is going after the $109 price point aggressively, perhaps more aggressively than AMD was expecting. The takeaway: AMD executing its mainstream strategy and winning back considerable market share from NVIDIA will be easier said than done.

            ","Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) recently revealed the Switch, a hybrid gaming console that seamlessly transforms from a handheld into a home console via a dock and detachable controllers. 
The design aesthetic is similar to the Wii U's, except that the Wii U's handheld mode only works when the touchscreen controller is in range of the base console. The Switch is also similar to Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Shield tablet, which transforms into a home console when connected to a TV and a controller.

Image source: Nintendo.
Therefore, the revelation that the Switch will be powered by Nvidia's Tegra CPUs instead of AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) APUs wasn't all that surprising. But that shift also indicates that AMD's iron grip on the console market might be weakening. 
AMD's APUs (which combine CPUs and GPUs) currently power Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One, and its GPUs powered the Wii and Wii U. If Nintendo's use of Tegra chips indicates a fresh start for Nvidia in the gaming console market, should AMD start worrying?
Nintendo is often considered an underdog in the console market. After all, it's only sold 13.3 million Wii Us worldwide, compared to 22.3 million Xbox Ones and 43.4 million PS4s. The Wii U's smaller audience and weaker hardware specs also caused many publishers to shun the console during cross-platform releases. 
However, many critics overlook the fact that Nintendo's 3DS handheld is actually the best-selling console of the current generation, with 59.3 million units sold worldwide. Sony, by comparison, has only sold 14.3 million PS Vitas. 
With the Wii U, Nintendo was trying to leverage its strong position in handhelds to expand into living rooms. But since the Wii U controller couldn't work as a stand-alone handheld, it was never clear exactly who the console was designed for. The Switch, however, sends a clear message that it's a console that can be played anywhere. 
Nintendo executives likely noticed that Nvidia was using its Shield devices to showcase the power of its Tegra SoCs, which were marginalized in the mainstream mobile market by Qualcomm. Like Nintendo, Nvidia was pursuing a ""gaming anywhere"" strategy.
For example, the Shield tablet plays regular Android games on Google Play and Shield-optimized games through Nvidia's Shield Hub, and streams PC games over home networks. In ""console mode"", the device attaches to a TV and a controller. 
Like the Shield tablet, the Switch's ""brain"" is really just a powerful gaming tablet. Since AMD's tablet-based Micro Series APUs aren't as well-known as Nvidia's Tegra SoCs, it made sense for Nintendo to use Nvidia's chips. Jefferies & Co. analyst Mark Lipacis recently estimated that the Switch could add up to $320 million in annual revenues to Nvidia's top line.

AMD depends heavily on sales of semi-custom APUs for the PS4 and Xbox One to support its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which generated over 60% of its sales last quarter. During that quarter, EESC sales rose 31% annually on robust sales of gaming consoles. 
Sony and Microsoft's upgrades for their consoles -- like the PS4 Slim, PS4 Pro, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio -- are expected to keep the APU orders flowing. Therefore, the impact of Nintendo's decision to use Nvidia's chips might seem minimal. 
However, investors should remember that AMD didn't always dominate the console market -- the original Xbox was powered by an Nvidia GPU, and the PS3 used a proprietary GPU co-developed by Nvidia and Sony. Therefore, if the Switch sparks a new form factor revolution, Sony or Microsoft might consider launching new hybrid devices also powered by Nvidia's Tegra chips.
In addition to moving in on AMD's turf in consoles, Nvidia has been aggressively attacking AMD with budget graphics cards like the 3GB GTX 1060 ($200), the 4GB GTX 1050 Ti ($139), and the 2GB GTX 1050 ($109). Those new cards recently forced AMD to reduce the prices of its 4GB RX 470 to $170, and its RX 460 to $110. 
Whereas AMD could previously generate revenue from niches like gaming console APUs and low-end GPUs, Nvidia seems intent on pushing its only meaningful rival in GPUs out of the market. It's unclear if Nintendo will give Nvidia the momentum it needs to make an impression on Sony and Microsoft again, but AMD investors should pay close attention to the Switch's arrival this holiday season.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) beat analyst estimates on all fronts when it reported its third-quarter results on Oct. 20. The company posted double-digit revenue growth along with a non-GAAP (adjusted) net profit, both signs that AMD's turnaround is making tangible progress.
During AMD's earnings conference call, CEO Lisa Su and CFO Devinder Kumar provided some additional commentary on the company's performance. Here are four key quotes, taken from the transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.
AMD's first Polaris graphics cards launched at the very end of the second quarter, so the company's third-quarter results offer the first indication of how the new products are faring. According to Su, Polaris has been a success so far:
In graphics, we had a very strong quarter, with discrete GPU revenue and unit shipments growing by double-digit percentages sequentially and year-over-year. The launch of our expanded family of Polaris desktop GPUs, and our first full quarter of RX 480 sales drove our highest quarterly channel GPU revenue and ASP since early 2014. Radeon RX GPUs now account for more than 50% of our channel GPU revenue.
It was toward the end of 2014 when AMD's graphics business went off the rails. A lack of competitive products, particularly at the high end of the market, led rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) to scoop up share, relegating AMD to also-ran status. AMD has been clawing back market share for the past few quarters, and it now seems that Polaris will help continue that trend.
AMD's focus on the mainstream graphics market with Polaris has allowed NVIDIA to essentially run away with the high-end portion of the market. For AMD, winning back market share has been the No. 1 priority, and temporarily ceding the high end is likely a sacrifice worth making. Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end graphics architecture, is set to launch sometime next year.
One of the major barriers to profitability for AMD has been its balance sheet, which featured more than $2 billion of debt at the end of the second quarter. This translates into annual interest payments of roughly $160 million.
During the third quarter, AMD took advantage of its soaring stock price to raise cash. As Kumar explained, the result is a less precarious financial situation:
Debt as of the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter, due to our significant debt reduction effort. During the third quarter, we raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock, which includes the exercise of an underwriter's option to purchase 15% or $90 million of additional common stock, and the issuance of $700 million in 2 1/8% convertible notes due in 2026.
AMD expects its annualized interest expense to be reduced by approximately $55 million beginning in the fourth quarter. Higher revenue will ultimately be required to bring AMD back into the black on a GAAP basis, but lower interest payments certainly help the cause.
AMD slashed spending on research and development over the past few years as it grappled with collapsing revenue. In 2015, AMD spent just $947 million on R&D, down from $1.45 billion in 2011. NVIDIA, which focuses solely on graphics products, now outspends AMD in this area.
Su sees this trend potentially reversing going forward:
So I think we have an opportunity to invest a bit more in R&D as our revenue grows, but we're still going to be very prudent with how we do that. I think the key metric there in terms of being net income profitable this quarter, ensuring that we get free cash flow positive from operations for the full year, those are all important metrics for us, and we're going to continue to manage very diligently.
AMD faces a difficult challenge. The company needs to show that it can return to profitability, but it also needs to invest in the future to ensure that it doesn't fall behind. Cutting R&D spending can boost short-term profits, but it can also wreak havoc on the company's long-term competitiveness. Finding the right balance will not be an easy task for management in the coming years.
While AMD's computing and graphics segment still posted an operating loss during the third quarter, the semi-custom segment grew both revenue and profit. Beyond AMD's initial game console wins, the company has announced three additional semi-custom design wins, and some of those wins are now contributing revenue. Unfortunately, Su had nothing new to announce on the semi-custom front:
I will say that we previously announced three, and that's the number that we'll talk about today. Two of them are now known, and they're both in the game console area, one is outside of game console. I will say that we have some very good active discussions on future products and applications, and we'll update more as we get further along.
With two of the new semi-custom design wins being game consoles, the company remains dependent on a market that tends to peak a few years after a new console is launched and then decline until the next generation begins. The semi-custom business will need to be more diversified for it to be a real long-term growth driver for the company.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been engaged in a bitter graphics card battle for years, but NVIDIA just landed a new blow to its rival.
The company debuted two new graphics cards recently -- the GeForce GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti -- based on the company's new Pascal architecture, and they sell for just $109 and $139, respectively.
NVIDIA isn't a stranger to the budget graphics card market, and these two particular cards have been rumored for a few months. But the new cards should worry AMD for two key reasons: The cards offer some of the best performance at the lowest prices, and NVIDIA is marketing them to new gamers, a group it typically doesn't focus on.
NVIDIA made it clear in a blog post that the 1050 and 1050 Ti are great for new gamers, saying, ""If you're a new gamer, these two new GPUs let you be a part of the biggest story in gaming."" NVIDIA usually tops the list for the best high-end graphics cards, but by targeting new gamers, it's also ensuring that it dominates the low-end market as well. 
The company already holds an impressive 70% of the discrete desktop GPU market, but AMD has started to make some gains over the past year.
Data source: Jon Peddie Research.
By releasing the two new graphics cards, NVIDIA updates its budget graphics cards and hopefully spurs new sales in the lower-end market. That's important for NVIDIA because the company's own average selling price (ASP) trend has tilted toward pushing ASPs higher, not lower. That's typically a good thing, but in this case, lower prices mean it can grab more of the budget card market. 
While AMD is making some market share gains on NVIDIA, it's clearly still the underdog. AMD has been able to hold onto customers primarily by offering lower-priced cards than NVIDIA, but this latest move from its rival could end up hurting AMD. 
AnandTech recently wrote that the pricing differences between NVIDIA's new graphics cards and AMD's low-end cards ""[mean] that AMD's two-month run as the sole supplier of current-generation entry-level video cards is about to come to an end.""
NVIDIA's new cards compete directly with AMD's RX 460, which starts at $109 for the 2GB version (the same as NVIDIA's 1050) and $140 for the 4GB version (the same as NVIDIA's 1050 Ti). 
But a separate AnandTech article noted that while the prices are about the same, ""In theory, Nvidia's cards should be a wee bit faster, with the 1050 Ti in particular sporting some great specs for the money.""
We'll still have to wait and see how well the new GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti sell compared to AMD's comparable cards before we know how much of an advantage this could be for NVIDIA. The 1050 Ti will begin selling October 25, and the 1050 will follow on November 8, with NVIDIA saying the cards will be available worldwide on those dates.
What will be interesting to see is if NVIDIA continues to focus on the lower-end market even as it dominates high-end cards. NVIDIA earned about 55% of its total revenue in Q2 2017 from its gaming segment, and grabbing both ends of the graphics card spectrum could help the company keep its gaming revenue up. AMD may have made some recent market share gains against NVIDIA, but these new cards prove that NVIDIA isn't willing to let its rival gain any more ground without a fight.

A plethora of analysts agree that NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) shares are deeply undervalued. Fellow chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also found on many lists of promising low-cost investment ideas.
One of these stocks is not like the other, though. Let me show you what sets NXP apart from AMD, and what kind of investor might prefer each of these chip tickers.

Data from Yahoo! Finance.
To be fair, NXP's recent revenue growth wasn't organic at all. The company merged with fellow embedded chip specialist Freescale Semiconductor in a $12 billion deal that closed last December. That combination should boost NXP's annual sales by approximately 66% by the end of 2016, though some investors might see it as the easy way to increase revenue.
By contrast, AMD pinned its second-quarter sales jump on strong demand for its graphics products and semi-custom processors. That's a clean serving of organic growth, which is a high-quality revenue booster.
But before we jump to conclusions about AMD's sales growth being much more desirable than NXP's version, let me put the two companies into a historical context:

AMD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
AMD's recent sales bump was a welcome respite from many quarters of plunging revenues. The company has been in freefall for years and is a turnaround story that never quite seems to find a happy ending. The current uptick rests chiefly on semi-custom chips that are shipped into the video game console markets. This year's surge is likely to peak in the third quarter, as the console builders put together their product reserves for the holidays.
In short, AMD has no choice but to bet the farm on gaming consoles even though mobile gaming seems constantly poised to destroy the traditional console market. Game publishers and console makers are pulling out all the stops to stem the mobile tide, but how long will that effort last?
And what are the chances that AMD finds a way to exploit the mobile hardware market before it's too late?
It sure hasn't happened yet.
Over on the NXP side, that company is betting big on the exploding market for automotive computing.
The Freescale acquisition put NXP in an unchalleneged leadership position of that fragmented sector, and the future is wrapped in chrome and leather. For now, car-related chips tend to focus on infotainment system, in-car networking, data security, and engine controls. Not that far into the future, the demand for car-specific chips will skyrocket as self-driving cars go mainstream -- and NXP is sitting pretty at this critical juncture.
Long story short, AMD is a risky turnaround bet while NXP is a tantalizingly pure play on one of the largest market trends of this decade.
Both companies have been at the receiving end of buyout rumors in recent months. Let's be generous and assume that both NXP and AMD receive serious offers. Even so, it would make sense to give NXP investors a roomy buyout premium while AMD's buyer should get a risk-related discount.
NXP is a sensible option for many investor temperaments, including value hunters, buyout gamblers, and long-term growth visionaries. Meanwhile, only the gamblers need to worry about AMD's shares. The potential rewards there are more than balanced out by heaps of market and execution risks.

With shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) near their highest level in years, it can be easy to forget that the company is still unprofitable. In 2015, AMD posted a whopping $660 million net loss, its fourth annual net loss in a row. The situation has improved this year, with AMD managing to squeeze out a non-GAAP operating profit during the second quarter. But a return to true profitability remains elusive.
What will it take for AMD to turn a profit? Revenue, and lots of it.
AMD's revenue tumbled 27.5% in 2015, driven by sluggish demand for PCs and share losses to NVIDIA in the GPU market. Through the first six months of 2016, AMD has produced $1.86 billion of revenue, down from $1.97 billion during the same period last year. Cost-cutting has helped keep operating losses in check despite the lower revenue, but increasing sales is the only path to sustainable profitability.
One thing that has acted as a barrier to profitability for AMD is its debt load. During the first six months of 2016, AMD paid $81 million in interest on about $2.2 billion of debt. In 2015, interest payments ate up 4% of revenue, meaning that the company would have needed to deliver an operating margin of 4% just to break even after interest.
The good news for AMD is that its recently announced stock and convertible note sale, which is expected to raise more than $1 billion in total, will allow the company to pay down some of its debt and reduce its annual interest obligations. The surge in the stock price this year created an opening for AMD to raise cash, and the company took full advantage. This alone won't be enough to propel the company back to profitability, but it's a good move nonetheless.
AMD expects to grow total revenue by a low-single-digit percentage this year, but that won't be enough to return the company to profitability. Over the next few years, a few things will need to go right for AMD in order for the company to bring in enough revenue to pull the bottom line back into the black.
First, AMD's semi-custom business will need to secure sufficient revenue beyond gaming consoles. Both the number of consoles sold and the amount of revenue AMD receives per console will decline as this generation matures, creating a hole that the company will need to fill. AMD has already announced three design wins -- one of which is Microsoft's Project Scorpio console -- that are expected to bring in a total of $1.5 billion over the next three to four years. That's a good start, but AMD will need to keep winning deals in order to drive meaningful growth in the long run.
Second, AMD will need to win back graphics market share from NVIDIA. The company has already launched its mainstream Polaris graphics cards, and with NVIDIA mainly focused on the high end, there's a good chance that AMD is picking up mainstream customers. How much additional revenue this will create remains unclear, though. We'll need to wait until AMD reports its third-quarter results later this month to find out.
Third, AMD's upcoming Zen CPUs, set to launch next year for PCs and servers, will need to find a way to claw back market share from Intel. As long as Zen proves competitive, AMD has a decent shot at making progress. Intel has slowed the pace at which it moves to new manufacturing processes, meaning that the manufacturing gap between Intel and AMD will be narrower than it's been in quite some time. As long as Zen doesn't fail to live up to expectations, AMD has a good chance at winning back at least some market share.
If things go right for AMD, the company could conceivably return to profitability next year or in 2018. But an important follow-up question is this: Can AMD produce enough profits to justify its soaring stock price? With a market capitalization of around $5.4 billion, AMD will likely need to sustainably produce a few hundred million dollars of profit annually to keep its stock afloat. AMD has done it before, but the good times have never lasted for more than a few years. Will this time be different? Only time will tell.

            ","The virtual reality market is growing quickly. Right now there are an estimated 43 million active virtual reality (VR) users, but that's supposed to skyrocket to 171 million by 2018, according to Statista. That growth is spurring small and large technology companies alike to focus more of their attention and technology into VR pursuits. 
Image source: Getty Images.
For investors looking to tap into the VR market Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Sony (NYSE:SNE), and InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) should certainly be on your radar. Let's take a look at what each company is doing with VR. 
Advanced Micro Devices made some huge strides in the virtual reality space last year when the company released its Radeon RX 480 graphics card, priced at just $199.
Even at that price, the graphics card can handle the most powerful VR headsets on the market -- the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive -- and gives gamers a cheap way to jump into the best VR experience around.
An ArsTechnica review of the RX 480 said that for $200 the RX 480 is the ""best graphics card you can buy.""  Unfortunately for AMD, the company's bitter rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) released it's own budget card a few months later that Ars said was ""the new best budget graphics card.""  
But that shouldn't scare off investors. AMD's card is still $50 cheaper than NVIDIA's lowest-end GTX 1060 card, and it can hold its own against NVIDIA's card for many VR games, according to ArsTechnica.
Additionally, AMD is making some gains against NVIDIA in the discrete GPU market space. NVIDIA is still the clear leader, but AMD's gains should help the company gain a bigger share of the VR component space. 
Data Source: Jon Peddie Research.  
The other huge upside to AMD is the fact that the company supplies the graphics cards inside of Sony's PlayStation 4. The company has sold more than 53 million units so far and it's one of the best VR-ready consoles on the market. Sony is making big strides in VR (which I'll talk about in a minute) and any increase in sales for PS4, and its recently released variations, could help graphics card sales for AMD as well.  
Sony's stock is currently trading at 15 times its forward earnings, which is cheaper than the tech industry's average P/E ratio of 26. And compared to another major VR company focusing on hardware, Oculus-owner Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Sony is significantly cheaper. Facebook currently has a forward P/E of about 20.
Facebook is playing the long game in VR with the Oculus Rift headset, which is priced at the high end of the market at about $500, after receiving a $100 price cut in March. Meanwhile, Sony's new PlayStation VR headset costs just $399. That gives Sony a price advantage over Facebook and some other VR headset hardware makers, but it also has another advantage. 
Tens of millions of PS4 consoles are already in consumers' homes. That makes the barrier to adopt VR technology much lower than for many PC users (which is what the Oculus Rift requires). Only 1% of computers sold this year will be VR-ready, while Sony already has 40 million console users that could potentially jump into VR right now.
InvenSense's motion sensors have been in the most popular smartphones for years, but the company is looking to the virtual reality market to spur new growth. 
InvenSense released its new ICM-20603 6-axis inertial sensor over the summer, aimed squarely at the augmented and virtual reality markets. The company says the sensor gives VR headsets tighter alignment for head-tracking motions as well as faster refresh rates, both of which are an important part of a good VR experience. 
InvenSense CEO and President, Behrooz Abdi, said on the company's fiscal Q1 2017 earnings call that, ""In the gaming and virtual reality segments, or VR, we have extended our market share with our latest 6-axis motion sensor, and are currently ramping with a game controller at a tier-1 gaming OEM.""
Abdi went on to say that IHS estimates head-mounted displays are expected to grow at a more than 50% compound annual growth rate over the next four years and that InvenSense could benefit from the need for high performance motion tracking.  
Virtual reality is expected to become a $70 billion business by 2020, according to TrendForce. And all of that growth is convincing nearly every major technology company to make at least some sort of move into the space.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has made meaningful progress this year. It launched Polaris, its line of mainstream graphics cards that aim to win back market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Various financial maneuvers, including multiple joint ventures and a stock offering, have strengthened the company's balance sheet. And a return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second quarter signaled that the worst may be over.
The second phase of AMD's comeback will begin next year. Zen, the company's upcoming CPU architecture, will launch early in the year, with PC variants coming first, followed by server variants, and finally APUs. Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end GPU, is expected to begin shipping in the first half of the year, with the goal of challenging NVIDIA in the high-end of the GPU market after years of playing second fiddle.
While AMD's turnaround seems to be picking up steam, both Zen and Vega will need to be successful for the company to reach its full potential.
Expectations are high leading up to Zen's release. AMD has promised significant performance improvements that should at the very least narrow the gap between its own products and those of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). According to AMD, Zen will boost instructions per cycle by 40% compared to the previous generation of CPUs, a major increase enabled by a host of improvements.

Winning back share in the PC market will be the first goal. Zen will focus on the high-end of the market at launch, with AMD aiming to peel away profitable market share from Intel. With the PC market as a whole continuing to slump, going after the high-end gives the company the best chance at returning to profitability.
The server market is equally important for AMD. Intel currently dominates the market for server CPUs, with AMD's market share essentially rounding down to zero. AMD estimates that the total addressable market is around $18 billion, so even clawing back 5% of the market from Intel would significantly boost AMD's top line. Intel won't give up market share without a fight, but AMD's server business can't really get any worse.
Zen doesn't need to be better than Intel's products for AMD to win back some market share, but it does need to close the performance gap. If Zen lives up to the hype, AMD's turnaround will continue to gain momentum. If it doesn't, returning to sustainable profitability will be tough.

While Polaris aims squarely at the mainstream portion of the graphics card market, Vega, which is expected to launch during the first half of 2017, will be AMD's re-entry into the high-end of the market. Ever since NVIDIA launched the GTX 970 and GTX 980 in late 2014, the company has dominated the market for expensive, and highly profitable, graphics cards. Vega will be AMD's attempt to appeal to the high-end gaming PC market.
NVIDIA has a head start, launching the GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 earlier this year. Higher-end variants are expected to be released in the coming months as well, including a rumored GTX 1080 Ti. NVIDIA's next-gen GPU, Volta, is unlikely to be launched earlier than the second half of 2017, but AMD's Vega will be launching into a market dominated by NVIDIA.
Vega will need to be disruptive in order to pry away high-end market share from NVIDIA. If AMD succeeds in producing a viable challenger to NVIDIA's high-end cards, the company's graphics business could become more profitable compared to a scenario where the company only succeeds in winning back mainstream market share.
For AMD, 2016 was important, but 2017 will be a critical year as well. The fate of AMD's nascent turnaround will be determined by the success of Zen and Vega.

Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) watched helplessly as its unit share of the discrete graphics card market was cut in half. Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) scored a coup with its 900 series of graphics cards, particularly the GTX 970, which remains to this day the most widely owned graphics card among Steam users. AMD's market share bottomed out during the second quarter of 2015, at just 18%.
The company has been slowly clawing its way back over the past year, picking up a few points of market share here and there. AMD's comeback accelerated in the second quarter of this year, with the company gaining roughly 7 percentage points of market share compared to the first quarter, and nearly 12 percentage points year over year.

This gain in market share is good news for AMD, but it comes with caveats. The second quarter was seasonally weak, with total discrete graphics card shipments tumbling 20.8% compared to the first quarter, according to Jon Peddie Research. Whether market share gains in a weak quarter will stick around during the third and fourth quarters remains to be seen. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, AMD's market share peaked during the second quarter and declined during the third quarter.
Another issue is the timing of new product launches. NVIDIA's high-end GTX 1080 became available at the end of May, and the GTX 1070 became available in the beginning of June. The GTX 1060 wasn't launched until the end of July, with a $200 variant only becoming available in August. Meanwhile, AMD's $200 RX 480 launched in the last days of the second quarter, with the lower-end RX 470 and 460 launching in August.
The second-quarter data, then, doesn't tell us much about how AMD's new Polaris graphics cards are faring. Despite losing market share, NVIDIA posted solid second-quarter results. The company's gaming segment grew revenue by 18% year over year, driven by the high-end Pascal cards. AMD winning market share during the second quarter may have been driven more by NVIDIA's focus on the high end, leaving the mainstream to AMD, than anything else.
As it stands today, AMD's Polaris graphics cards target the $200-and-below segment, while NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards target the $200-and-above segment. Eventually, NVIDIA will launch lower-end products, and AMD will launch higher-end products, but at the moment, the two companies' newest graphics cards are only directly competing at the $200 price point. This should help AMD win mainstream market share during the third quarter, at the expense of ceding the lucrative high-end portion of the market to NVIDIA.
Rumors point to NVIDIA launching two low-end cards, the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti, as early as next month. Nothing has been confirmed at this point, but the cards are expected to target the $119 and $149 price points, respectively, putting them in direct competition with AMD's RX 460 and RX 470. Depending on how aggressive NVIDIA is with these new cards, AMD's edge in the mainstream portion of the market may not last too much longer.
AMD's market share gains during the second quarter are certainly a positive for the company, but they need to be considered in context. We won't know how Polaris has truly fared until results from the third quarter are released, and the imminent launch of low-end cards from NVIDIA could make it tougher for AMD to hold onto any market share gains in the fourth quarter and beyond. Where the market for discrete graphics cards ultimately settles, whether it's the old 60-40 split in NVIDIA's favor, or something else entirely, is still a big unknown.

Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is popular again -- and it has Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to thank for it.
By now you've all heard about Intel's unexpected increase in its guidance for the current quarter. What you may not have noticed, however, is the effect that this guidance tweak is having on the stock of its fiercest rival, AMD.
So far, since Intel 's new guidance came out, no fewer than three analysts have revised their opinion of AMD stock in just two days. Craig-Hallum upgraded AMD stock to buy yesterday. Shortly after that, Bernstein upgraded AMD shares from underperform to market perform. And just now, says TheFly.com, Susquehanna Securities is jumping on the bandwagon (albeit tentatively), and initiating coverage of AMD stock with a neutral rating.
So what's all the fuss about? Here are three things you need to know.
All of a sudden, semiconductor stocks are looking red hot. Image source: Getty Images.
Let's begin with the what of what's happening, before addressing the why. Yesterday, Craig-Hallum announced its buy rating on AMD stock. This was quickly followed by two somewhat more cautious ratings: from Bernstein, which now rates AMD market perform (i.e., neutral) and estimates the stock's value at $5 per share; and from Susquehanna -- likewise neutral, but with a $6.50 price target.
Currently, AMD stock is selling for just over $6 a share, implying no more than 5% upside from Susquehanna's estimate -- and still significant downside risk from Bernstein.
TheFly.com reports that Craig-Hallum based its upgrade on new ""Q3 guidance on PC strength"" from Intel. Based on this guidance, Craig-Hallum argues there is ""solid demand and a healthy pricing environment in both HDD and NAND,"" and that this will prove a positive for AMD stock.
Intel raised its previous guidance for fiscal third-quarter revenue by 5% last week, to $15.6 billion. The company's new guidance calls for more than a $1 billion increase in sales from Q3 of last year -- 7% year-over-year growth. Additionally, Intel hiked its gross margin expectation by 2%, to 62%, indicating that not only are PC chip sales coming in hotter than expected -- but they're more profitable as well.
This implies there is some measure of pricing power in the sector, which could benefit not just Intel stock, but AMD stock as well.
Perhaps the most curious thing about all of the above, though, is this: Since Intel raised its guidance, investors have increased the amount of money they're willing to pay for a share of Intel stock by only 1.4%, while AMD stock is up twice as much -- 3%.
That's a big disparity, and a strange one: The company that confirmed the good news is getting less of a lift from it than is its rival, which investors are only guessing might benefit from the good news. Does it really make sense, though, for investors to favor AMD stock over Intel?
I'd argue not.
Intel stock costs 18 times today, pays a 2.9% dividend yield, but is pegged for only 10% long-term earnings growth on Wall Street. That already looks kind of expensive, which helps to explain why Intel stock itself didn't get a very big lift from its improved guidance. (Also, as my fellow Fool Anders Bylund pointed out last week, Intel stock had already gained 25% over the past year, so there may not have been much more room to grow.)
AMD, on the other hand, has no profits to speak of. AMD pays no dividend and, judging from the analyst estimates posted on Yahoo! Finance, it's expected by most people on Wall Street to post ever greater losses over the next five years, with no improvement in sight.
So what's the upshot for investors today? Intel's guidance offers some faint hope that analysts' worst fears over AMD may not come to pass. Maybe, if PC chip sales are growing faster than expected, and more profitably, AMD will find a way to lose less money this quarter, and this year, than previously feared. But overall, the big picture remains unchanged:
Until AMD finds a way to actually earn a profit, the stock still isn't worth buying.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is certainly an alluring company right now. Its shares have gained more than 100% year-to-date, with much of the bullish sentiment riding on the growing popularity and opportunity behind virtual reality.
To help put the recent stock run in perspective -- and to point out some potential pitfalls at the company -- let's take a look at three charts that paint a fuller picture of AMD and the state of its business.
Longtime AMD shareholders will know that the company's revenue has been anything but encouraging over the past few years. Since 2014, the top line has declined by about 39% from its high.
Data by YCharts.
The main reason for the decline came from slowing sales of AMD's PC processors, particularly in notebooks. PC chips are among the company's biggest revenue drivers, and a slowdown in the PC market over the past few years has hurt AMD tremendously.
Despite the bad times, the company is starting to see revenue growth return, thanks to increased demand for chips and a new licensing deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology. The latter adds about $52 million to AMD's revenue this year, while the former should help the company's long-term prospects.
AMD certainly isn't out of the woods yet, and investors will need to see the company deliver on promising new chips (like its upcoming Zen processor for servers) and new GPUs to see if the recent rebound is sustainable. 
A couple of years ago, the company highlighted a few key areas that it would pursue in order to turn around its business. One of those areas of focus is what the company calls immersive platforms, which include PC components and the growing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) markets. 
The total addressable market for immersive platforms is $20 billion, according to the company, and much of that will come from the AR and VR segments. 
AMD CTO Mark Papermaster highlighted the company's focus on boosting VR adoption rates in a recent interview with TechRadar, saying:
At AMD, we frankly aim to directly impact that adoption rate. That's why, for instance, we brought that $200 price point for the RX 480. That broke the paradigm -- that is a VR-ready graphics card. You can have a wonderful VR experience, 90 frames per second, very low latency with that graphics card.
The graph below shows exactly why AMD is pinning some of its future revenue prospects on the AR and VR markets -- because they'll be worth potentially $150 billion by 2020.

AR and VR certainly aren't the only markets that AMD is focusing on, of course, but with immersive platforms marked as one of the top three focuses for the company over the next few years, it's clear the company is expecting its GPUs to be a major part of its growth story.
It's hard to write an article showing some of the most important AMD charts without including the company's massive bull run this year. The stock has already more than doubled in 2016, with a nearly 220% gain over the past 12 months.  
Data by YCharts.
Management and shareholders hope that the upcoming Zen release could steal some of the $18 billion server market away from rival Intel. The company says it has already secured several design wins with original equipment manufacturers and that it will officially launch the chip in the first half of 2017.
AMD certainly has a lot going for it in the GPU, VR, and PC markets -- management is wisely pursuing new areas of growth and re-entering markets where they believe the company can succeed (like server processors).
But without stable revenue, the incredible share price gains would make me hesitant to invest in the company right now. It definitely appears that there are brighter days ahead for the company, but investors should be careful not to overestimate the success AMD will enjoy based on such early efforts with little to show for them.

With shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soaring this year, driven by hype surrounding its Polaris GPUs and upcoming Zen CPUs, it's not surprising that the company is taking advantage of its elevated stock price. AMD plans to sell approximately $600 million worth of new shares for $7.51 a pop, a price that's about four times higher than where the stock price stood at this time last year. Another $450 million will be raised by selling convertible notes, with the cumulative proceeds going toward paying down AMD's existing debt.

AMD data by YCharts.
Investors aren't thrilled about the dilution that this stock sale will cause, knocking down the stock for two days in a row following the announcement. But for AMD, it's a great move that will shore up its balance sheet ahead of the launch of Zen next year.
AMD expects to sell about 79.9 million shares, assuming an offer price of $7.51 per share. The net proceeds of the deal will be approximately $581.3 million, or as much as $668.6 million if the underwriters exercise their options to buy an additional $90 million worth of stock. AMD's diluted share count stood at 821 million at the end of the second quarter, meaning that this offering will increase the share count by nearly 10%.
AMD is also selling $450 million worth of convertible senior notes due in 2026, with the company expecting net proceeds of $439.1 million, or as much as $505.1 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option. The interest rate and conversion price have yet to be determined according to the SEC filing detailing the offering. These convertible notes will cause additional dilution.
In total, AMD could raise as much as $1.17 billion through these two offerings. The company plans to use this money to pay down existing debt, including $226 million that AMD borrowed under a revolving credit line, and up to $1.02 billion worth of outstanding senior notes due in 2020. Those notes yield 7.75%, giving AMD the opportunity to reduce its annual interest expense.
Until the offerings are complete and more details are known, the exact impact on AMD's interest obligations can't be determined. Over the past 12 months, AMD paid $161 million in interest on about $2.24 billion of debt. That interest represents a barrier to AMD returning to profitability, and reducing it by potentially tens of millions of dollars annually will reduce the time it takes for the company to put an end to its long string of losses.
Because AMD plans to use the proceeds for paying down debt, the company's cash balance shouldn't be affected all that much. However, a deal earlier this year that resulted in AMD selling its assembly and test facilities into a joint venture raised about $320 million, boosting the company's cash balance to a comfortable level. At the end of the second quarter, AMD was sitting on nearly $1 billion of cash thanks to that deal.
For investors, the dilution caused by the stock and convertible offering will reduce per-share earnings in the event that AMD returns to profitability. But the reduction in interest payments will boost profits, so it's not all bad news. Had AMD decided to sell additional shares a year ago, when the stock was in the doldrums, the dilution would have been much worse.
With the first Polaris graphics cards already launched, AMD's third-quarter report should shed some light on how the graphics business has fared. Zen won't arrive in volume until next year, so investors still have a while to wait before it's clear whether AMD's plan to effectively compete with Intel comes to fruition.
By selling stock now, when the hype surrounding these products is at a fever pitch, AMD is maximizing its ability to reduce its debt load. In the long run, despite the dilution, that's a good thing for investors.

The stock market treaded water on Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 both posting minimal losses even as the Nasdaq Composite inched higher to set a new all-time record high. Investors seemed unwilling to take major positions in either direction before knowing how the Federal Reserve and other global central banks are likely to respond to current economic conditions, and that uncertainty offset solid gains in the energy markets that sent crude oil prices up more than $1 to climb above $46 per barrel. Several stocks held the market back from gains, and among the poorest performers were Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM), HD Supply (NASDAQ:HDS), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Whole Foods Market lost 5% in the wake of a warning from competing natural foods specialist Sprouts Farmers Market. Whole Foods' smaller rival updated its guidance, pointing to ongoing deflation and increased pressure on the promotional front in pulling back on its outlook for the rest of the year. With expectations for flat comparable-store sales growth for the third quarter, Sprouts said that it expects earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.86 for the full 2016 year. Whole Foods investors interpreted the poor results of its industry peer as reflective of the environment for natural and organic grocery products as a whole. Given the challenges that Whole Foods has already faced, this new challenge was the last thing that many Whole Foods investors wanted to see hurting the pioneering chain's potential rebound.
HD Supply dropped 12% after announcing second-quarter financial results that fell short of expectations. The distributor of industrial materials said that net income dropped by about 10%, and the company also reined in its guidance for its third-quarter results. HD Supply now believes that it might not be able to grow its revenue for the full year beyond what it brought in last year, and that could bode poorly for a stock that had been hovering near all-time record highs. Investors will want to see signs that HD Supply can continue thriving no matter what the industrial business cycle brings, and for now, they're concerned that the future might not be as bright as the past has been.
Finally, Advanced Micro Devices fell 7%. The tech company said late Tuesday that it would raise capital through offerings of stock and debt, including a $600 million secondary offering of common shares and $450 million in 10-year convertible senior notes. The company expects to use the net proceeds to repay what it owes on its credit facility and to restructure other debt by offering to buy back outstanding senior notes. The stock drop reflects concerns about the potential dilutive effect of issuing equity, but with the shares having jumped to their highest levels since 2012, AMD seems to be taking advantage of investor optimism at a perfect time. In the long run, the move should be healthy for AMD's business, even if shareholders don't reap as much of the reward as they otherwise might have.

            ","This article was updated on Feb. 8, 2017, and originally published on Sept. 7, 2016.
The virtual reality market could grow from nearly nothing in 2015 to $30 billion by 2020, according to tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital. Piper Jaffray claims 500 million VR headsets could be sold by 2025.
Those numbers sound impressive, but it might be tough to figure out which companies will benefit the most from that growth. In this article, I'll discuss three tech companies that could generate fresh revenue streams from VR in the near future.
Facebook's Oculus Rift. Image source: Oculus VR.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which bought Oculus VR for $3 billion in 2014, is the top VR company to watch because it launched the first high-end commercial VR headset with the Oculus Rift and the first VR app ecosystem with Oculus Home.
Research firm SuperData estimated that Facebook sold about 355,000 Rifts last year. Last May, Facebook claimed that there were already 250 apps available in Oculus Home, which also serves Samsung's mobile-based Gear VR headsets. SuperData estimates that Samsung will sell 2.3 million Gear VR units this year, mainly because the $99 mobile-based device costs much less than the $600 Rift.

But Facebook isn't depending on Rift sales for growth. Instead, it's likely selling the devices at near break-even levels to spur sales of digital content through Oculus Home, where it retains a 30% cut of each sale. With Rift and Gear VR owners tethered to that ecosystem, Facebook could generate meaningful app revenue -- something which it couldn't do during the smartphone generation without a dominant mobile OS. Several Oculus Home games can already be played online with other players, which offers us a glimpse into the future of remote visits in VR space.
Oculus Rift and Oculus Home sales won't generate much revenue for Facebook, which generates most of its sales from ads, in the near future. But over the next few years, app revenues could climb, and Facebook could tether its social network into virtual reality, offering users a game-changing way of remotely interacting with their family and friends.
Sony (NYSE:SNE) launched the PlayStation VR, a VR headset for the PS4, last October. The headset costs $400, while a bundle including the PlayStation camera and Move controllers will cost $500. SuperData predicts that Sony sold 2.6 million PSVRs this year.
The PlayStation VR. Image source: Sony.
Since the PS4 only costs $400, the PSVR offers a more affordable high-end VR experience than the Rift or HTC's Vive ($800), which both require high-end PCs that cost at least $600. While the PSVR will work with current PS4s, the upcoming PS4 Neo upgrade could boost the performance of VR games for a smoother experience. It also differentiates the PS4 from Microsoft's Xbox One, which doesn't have a dedicated VR headset yet.
Strengthening the Game & Networks Services (G&NS) unit is a top priority for Sony, since it often posts stronger year-over-year growth than its other units. Sony could also strengthen its Pictures and Music businesses by selling VR/3D versions of its movies or music videos through the PlayStation Store.
AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is the chipmaking underdog that lost market share to Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 chips and Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) high-end GPUs over the past decade. But despite those headwinds, AMD is still well-poised to capitalize on the growth of the VR market.
First, AMD's RX 480 was the first $200 graphics card which could be used for VR gaming. PC builds using that card, including the $600 example I just mentioned, knocked the price of ""VR ready"" PCs under $1,000. Nvidia recently countered the 4GB RX 480 with the 3GB GTX 1060 at $200, but AMD already established a first-mover's advantage in the low-end VR space. Robust sales of the RX cards could continue strengthening its Computing and Graphics segment, which posted 28% annual sales growth last quarter.

Second, AMD's semi-custom APUs power the Xbox One and PS4. That's because APUs pack CPUs and GPUs together in smaller, more power-efficient packages than stand-alone processors. It's a rare strength that Intel and Nvidia -- the respective leaders in high-end CPUs and GPUs -- notably lack.
That strength boosted AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) revenues by 4% annually last quarter, and upcoming upgrades for the Xbox One and PS4 should ensure that growth continues. If hardware makers start manufacturing stand-alone headsets that aren't tethered to mobile devices or PCs, they could follow the footsteps of consoles and use AMD's APUs -- thus widening its moat against Intel and Nvidia.
The VR market is still in the early stages of development, and long-term forecasts might not be that accurate. But if you believe that VR headsets could become the next big computing platform after computers and smartphones, Facebook, Sony, and AMD could all profit from that paradigm shift.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has seen its stock pop 160%  this year, and there's good reason for that. Investors are benefiting from the company's recent release of new graphics processors, anticipation for its Zen PC processor, and the likelihood of its designs winning placement in Microsoft and Sony's next consoles.  
Many investors are also banking on AMD's new graphics cards, like the powerful Radeon RX 480, to propel the company further into the virtual reality hardware space. The RX 480 is an ideal candidate for high-end VR headsets, and it costs just $200.
That low price, mixed with the current growth of VR, could give AMD a strong position in the VR hardware market, which IDC forecasts will have a 183% compound annual growth rate between now and 2020.
But if investors like AMD as a VR play, I think there are two better buys that they should consider: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 
NVIDIA is, of course, AMD's biggest rival. Between them, the companies enjoy a GPU duopoly, with NVIDIA taking about 66% of the discrete GPU market, and AMD picking up the rest. 
And it's NVIDIA's dominance in GPUs that gives it the clear advantage. The company just released three new notebook graphics cards that add VR-ready capability to notebooks  -- not an easy feat. The company says the cards' processing capabilities come within 10% of those of their desktop computer counterparts.
Most VR-capable PCs are already using NVIDIA's processors, but the company is looking to expand that advantage even further. Jason Paul, the general manager of NVIDIA's Shield, gaming and VR business, recently told Barron's that its GPUs are starting to be used in powerful server computers -- and that those could eventually power virtual reality from the cloud.  
That's worth noting, because as VR grows, it'll become harder for PC's graphics cards (particularly the ones made for notebooks) to keep up with its intense processing demands. Cloud servers could be the answer, and NVIDIA is already making huge strides in the space with its DXG-1 supercomputer. 
VR aside, NVIDA's stock has popped nearly 87% this year thanks to the company's ongoing moves into new markets like driverless cars and machine learning. When it comes to an overall GPU play with a VR-focus, there's no company better than NVIDIA right now.  
I'll admit, it's a bit strange comparing AMD to Google. But both are making their own VR plays, and I think Google is the better investment.
According to Bloomberg, the company is about to launch its new Daydream virtual reality platform and content hub. Daydream will bring VR-focused apps, games, and videos all to one location for mobile devices. 
Bloomberg said that it could become the ""dominant way people engage with virtual reality"" just as Android became the dominant way people engage with smartphones.
Already the company is paying up to hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece for some individual pieces of original VR content for Daydream, and is also partnering with HBO, Hulu, Ubisoft, and the MLB and NBA to launch content on the platform. 
The opportunity for Google is that Daydream could become the place to access VR content on mobile devices (or, at least, Android ones). There is no VR content hub like this right now. Instead of having content creators or hardware makers fight over an online content distribution network, it makes much more sense to let Google bring them all together. And it's the main reason why I think Google could be the biggest VR winner this year.
AMD isn't a bad investment by any means, and its new lineup of graphics cards should keep it a formidable opponent to NVIDIA. But if investors are looking for companies that have distinct VR advantages, Google and NVIDIA are their best bets.

            ","Some investors might think that stocks only quadruple over multiple years. However, several stocks delivered ""four-bagger"" returns over the past 12 months. Let's examine three such stocks -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN), and Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) -- and see if they can keep delivering comparable returns in the future.

Image source: Getty Images.
AMD is an underdog chipmaker which battles Intel in the CPU market and Nvidia in the GPU market. It lost market share in both markets for years, sales fell, and its losses widened as it boosted spending to keep pace. AMD hit a 52-week low of $1.65 on Jan. 20, after it posted a 23% annual decline in revenue during the fourth quarter and offered weak guidance for the first quarter.
But if you had bought AMD that day, you would be sitting on a gain of over 350% today. AMD's sales fell 19% during the first quarter, but it announced strong guidance for the second quarter. During the second quarter, it posted 9% sales growth -- its first annual sales growth in two full years -- on robust demand for its semi-custom SoCs for gaming consoles. It also expects demand for those SoCs to rise as Microsoft and Sony respectively release upgraded versions of the Xbox One and PS4. AMD also returned to non-GAAP operating profitability during the quarter.

AMD now expects its sales to rise 18% for the third quarter, and analysts believe that it could finish the year with 3% growth. Sales of its new Polaris-based GPUs, which have dramatically lowered the price point for VR-ready PCs, could boost its GPU sales, while its upcoming Zen chips might help it regain some market share from Intel. 
Five9 provides cloud software for managing customer relationships at call centers. Its subscription-based VCC (Virtual Contact Center) platform competes directly against Salesforce's Call Center, but Five9 focuses on smaller businesses instead of Salesforce's larger enterprise customers.
Five9 went public in April 2014, and has delivered over 20% annual sales growth in every quarter since its public debut. Its revenue rose 29% last quarter, up from 26% growth in the previous quarter and 23% growth in the year ago quarter. Analysts expect the company to post 22% sales growth this year.
Fire9 also announced an annual dollar-based retention rate of 100% last quarter, up from 94% a year earlier, along with all-time records in enterprise and commercial bookings. Wall Street has already noticed Five9's hot streak -- if you had purchased Five9 at its 52-week low of $3.48 last October, your initial investment would have risen nearly 320%. Five9 is unprofitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP measures, but its losses are narrowing. 
Weibo, the microblogging site often referred to as ""China's Twitter,"" has rallied almost 340% from its 52-week low of $10.90 last October. That massive rally was fueled by Weibo's impressive sales growth -- its revenue rose 36% annually last quarter, compared to 24% growth in the previous quarter and 39% growth a year ago. Weibo attributes that growth to ""the strong adoption of social marketing"" boosting spending among major companies and SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). Analysts expect Weibo's revenue to rise 34% this year.

Weibo's monthly active users (MAUs) rose 33% annually to 282 million during the quarter, with 89% of users accessing the service from mobile devices. Its daily active users (DAUs) rose 36% to 126 million. By comparison, Twitter's MAUs rose just 3% to 313 million last quarter. Weibo's non-GAAP net income surged 225% to $35.5 million last quarter. On the same basis, Twitter's net income rose 92% last quarter. 
However, both Weibo and its parent company Sina face the threat of government censorship and abrupt shutdowns. Chinese censors temporarily shut down Sina before, erased Weibo accounts, and threatened the companies over poor self-censorship practices. Those threats indicate that Weibo's growth could abruptly grind to a halt due to government intervention.
With the market near all-time highs, investors should be mindful of AMD, Five9, and Weibo's valuations. AMD doesn't look expensive at 1.5 times sales, but Five9's P/S of 5.3 and Weibo's P/S of 18.3 look pricey. Therefore, investors should realize that these rallies could fade quickly if their streaks of hot sales growth end.

Both Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) have seen their stock prices skyrocket by about 70% over the past three months. That's great news for the companies' current shareholders, of course, but when it comes to picking the long-term winner between the two, which is your best bet now?
To answer that, let's take a quick look at what each of them has going for it:
AMD is a major player in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, where it completes with the other GPU powerhouse, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While NVIDIA makes the majority of sales in the discrete GPU market, AMD has managed to increase its percentage to about 34%. 
Some of AMD's share price gains came after the recent release of its new Radeon RX 480, RX 470, and RX 460 graphics cards. While NVIDIA has had its share of major product releases this year as well, investors were likely impressed that the company's graphics cards are much cheaper than NVIDIA's.
There are also two new growth areas that AMD is poised to benefit from: PCs and virtual reality (VR). Lots of companies are betting on VR, but AMD's GPUs, like its new RX 480, are capable of handling the data-processing demands of higher-end VR headsets. 
Combined, the markets for virtual reality and augmented reality are expected to hit $70 billion by 2020, and AMD should be able to grow its GPU sales right along with that trend. VR hardware sales (which include graphics cards) are expected to grow by 183% between now and 2020, according to IDC.
Additionally, AMD says it will unveil its new Zen PC processor in the first quarter of 2017. The long-awaited processor should help it expand further into the higher-end PC market (an area it currently lags far behind in). 
If all that weren't enough, AMD's processors for gaming consoles are poised for more growth. Sony is releasing an updated version of its PlayStation 4 soon, called the Neo, and Microsoft is readying a new version of the Xbox One. Both are expected to ship with AMD's technology inside them. Gaming consoles could play an integral role in VR adoption, which leaves even more opportunity for AMD.
Ambarella is best known for its SoC (system on a chip) hardware that powers GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) action cameras. That's been both a blessing and a curse for the company, as its fate is largely tied to how well or poorly GoPro's devices are selling.
Ambarella's recent share price gains have been due in large part to the company's strong fiscal Q1 2017 beat, and to investors' anticipation that there are even brighter days ahead.
That optimism has been fueled by the company notching more design wins across all of its major business segments in the past quarter, according to management's comments on the Q1 earnings call. But it remains to be seen whether Ambarella can live up to investors' positive feelings by delivering solid earnings. Second-quarter revenue estimates are for a range of between $60 million and $66 million, which would represent a 21% to 28% year-over-year decline.
Ambarella also makes image-processing semiconductors for drones, security cameras, and automotive cameras, and is expanding into processors for virtual reality headsets. All of these are very promising markets, but the company's bills are still largely paid from sales of chips to GoPro. 
That could be a temporarily good thing for the company this holiday season, when GoPro's Karma drone and its new HERO5 camera are expected to debut. It's believed that Ambarella's hardware won a spot in the HERO5, and might also be found in the Karma drone as well. 
Longtime Ambarella investors may already be used to the company's chaotic stock price pops and dips, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of them as we edge closer to the holiday season. The current stock price run-up makes the shares tempting, but remember that if the HERO5 and Karma wind up with poor sales (or if Ambarella didn't win a spot for its hardware in the drone), we're likely to see another huge sell-off. Because the company's fate is still so closely tied to GoPro's, I don't think Ambarella is a great long-term bet. 
As for AMD, some of the company's stock price gains are based on speculation about the future prospects of PC processor sales and VR adoption. That's not all bad, because these are two legitimate areas for investors to get excited about. But the company is also grounded in solid GPU sales and is continually gaining more market share in that space. 
AMD's fate isn't as closely tied to another single company as Ambarella's is, and for that reason -- along with its strong GPU position -- it's the better play for long-term investors.

It's been a great year to be an AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholder. The chipmaker's stock has risen nearly 170% year to date, strongly outperforming almost all of its peers and the broader market.
With the year more than halfway over, let's take a quick look back at some of AMD's best moves to date.
In June, AMD unveiled three new graphics processors: the RX 480, RX 470, and RX 460. All three are aimed at buyers on a budget, retailing for between $100 and $200. The flagship RX 480 is particularly notable, as it's able to power high-end virtual reality headsets, including the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.
Almost half of AMD's 2016 rally has come in the wake of these new GPUs. The market for virtual reality headsets is projected to surge in the years ahead. Research firm IDC believes that nearly 65 million VR headsets will ship in 2020, up from fewer than 10 million this year.
AMD remains a secondary player in the market for GPUs, but along with rival NVIDIA, holds a duopoly over the space. Investors appear to like AMD's prospects, as the RX 480 could help it court consumers unwilling to pay for NVIDIA's more expensive silicon.
About 60% of AMD's sales come from its enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment. The bulk of that revenue is directly attributable to AMD's video games business. AMD's chips power all current-generation video game consoles, including the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
In the past, video game console-makers released new systems every five to six years. However, the industry appears to be in the midst of a major shift, with more incremental hardware releases occurring more often. That could benefit AMD's semi-custom business in the years ahead.
Earlier this year, AMD confirmed that it had won the rights to three major new devices. One of those devices is Project Scorpio, an upgraded version of the Xbox One console set to ship in the fall of 2017. Another is likely the PlayStation 4 Neo, an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 confirmed to exist, but not yet detailed. The PlayStation 4 Neo is likely to be formally unveiled next month. It will probably sport an AMD chip.
In addition to GPUs and chips for video game consoles, AMD has a significant CPU business. Unfortunately, its CPUs haven't been particularly competitive in recent years. Rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) dominates the market, particularly at the high end -- if you purchase a PC that retails for more than $600, there's a good chance it will be powered by an Intel chip.
But AMD could reemerge as a viable market participant as early as next year. AMD has been hyping its forthcoming ""Zen"" processor since 2015, but offered more concrete details this year.
""I'm excited to report that, in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next generation Zen-based processor at Computex in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter, and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers' labs,"" said AMD CEO Lisa Su on the company's July earnings call.
Earlier this month, AMD demonstrated its forthcoming Summit Ridge -- a processor aimed at high-performance desktop PCs and slated to arrive in the first quarter next year. Details remain scant, but Summit Ridge appears to offer performance on par with Intel's i7 6900K, one of the company's top desktop processors.
AMD's business improved in 2016. Last quarter, AMD reported adjusted operating income, up from a loss in the same quarter last year. But the gain was slight, and AMD remains unprofitable under generally accepted accounting principles. At the same time, its sales have risen only modestly, up 9% on an annual basis last quarter.
The bulk of AMD's share price appreciation appears to have been driven by investors' hopes for a brighter future. With Zen on the horizon and interest in VR heating up, AMD could see meaningfully improved financials in the years ahead, justifying its stock's rapid rise.

By virtually any measure, 2016 has been fantastic for AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders. Year-to-date, AMD stock has risen nearly 160%, and is currently trading near levels not seen since 2012.
Why has AMD performed so spectacularly? Although a number of factors have gone in AMD's favor this year, much of its rally can be traced to one product: the Radeon RX 480.
The market for dedicated graphics processors is dominated by just two companies: AMD and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Of the two, AMD is the smaller player. Last quarter, around 10 million graphics cards were shipped worldwide, of which about 30% were powered by AMD's chips, according to Jon Peddie Research. The remaining 70% relied on chips from rival NVIDIA.
But that 30% is a notable improvement from last year. In the second quarter of 2015, AMD captured just 18% of the graphics card market. That upswing could continue, led by AMD's new family of processors.
In June, AMD unveiled three graphics processors based on its new Polaris architecture: the Radeon RX 480, RX 470, and RX 460. As the flagship card in AMD's lineup, the RX 480 is the most intriguing. It retails for just $199, but is able to power virtual reality headsets, including the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.
AMD shares have risen nearly 70% since the RX 480 was officially unveiled. It isn't the most powerful graphics card on the market, but it offers an economical way to experience VR.
""The launch of our new Polaris-based RX 480 GPUs at the end of June...helped contribute to our highest desktop channel GPU shipments since the fourth quarter of 2014,"" said AMD CEO Lisa Su on the company's July earnings call.
For investors interested in VR, AMD is one of the few companies offering significant exposure. Anyone pursuing a high-end virtual reality experience must buy a graphics processor. When they do, there's a good chance they'll buy one from AMD -- most likely the RX 480.
Interest in VR has skyrocketed in recent months, and demand for VR headsets is expected to surge in the years ahead. Research firm IDC projects that shipments of VR headsets will approach 65 million by 2020, up from about 9.6 million this year.
AMD's business has shown signs of improvement in 2016, but much of its rally may be predicated on investors projecting future dominance. Last quarter, AMD's revenue rose, but only modestly, inching up just over 9%. At the same time, it turned an operating loss into positive operating income, but only on an adjusted basis -- and even then, it only earned $3 million.
Rival NVIDIA is offering a suite of superior products. Currently, AMD has absolutely nothing in its arsenal that can hold its own with NVIDIA's flagship GTX 1080. Fortunately for AMD, the GTX 1080 is about three-times more expensive. But NVIDIA also offers competing products at commensurate price points, including the recently released GTX 1060 3GB.
But a rising tide could lift all boats. Even if AMD remains a secondary player in the graphics processor market, it could benefit from broadly growing demand, spurned on by widespread VR adoption.
The RX 480 isn't the best graphics card on the market, but it offers solid performance at an attractive price point. For investors, it gives them a reason to believe in AMD's graphics business. It's hard to think of a better, or more important product, AMD has released this year.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have exploded since last summer, driven by rising optimism that a long-awaited turnaround is finally here. The stock is up an astounding 330% since this time last year, giving investors who stuck it out an incredible return.

Data by YCharts.
These gains have been driven not by improving results but the expectation that they will improve in the future. AMD launched a brand new line of graphics cards, Polaris, earlier this year, and it plans to begin shipping in volume its upcoming Zen CPUs in 2017. Both AMD and the market predict that these new products will drive market share gains, from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the graphics card market and from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the PC and server CPU markets.
There's only one risk that really matters at this point for AMD investors, given the circumstances: It's that Polaris and Zen will fail to deliver on their promises.

Over the past few years, AMD went from a strong player in the graphics card market to an also-ran. Its unit market share slumped from around 40% in 2014 to just over 20% today as NVIDIA won customers with its disruptive GTX 900 series.
AMD has been slowly clawing back market share over the past few quarters, but the company needs something big in order to jump back to where it was two years ago. Polaris, a line of graphics cards aimed at the high-volume mainstream portion of the market, has the potential to reverse AMD's fortunes in the graphics card market. But NVIDIA won't give up its own gains without a fight.
The first Polaris card, the RX 480, launched to good reviews with its $199 to $239 price point representing an aggressive play at the mainstream graphics card market. It only took a few weeks for NVIDIA to respond, launching the $249 GTX 1060 in July, with a $199 version launched earlier this month. The cheaper version is aimed directly at the lower-end RX 480, while the more expensive version delivers better performance for a slightly higher price.
AMD has since launched two lower-end Polaris graphics cards, the RX 470 and RX 460, and NVIDIA has yet to respond with low-end cards of its own. But the main takeaway is that AMD's Polaris, while competitive with NVIDIA's new Pascal graphics cards, isn't the kind of disruptive product that makes for guaranteed wins. Getting back to a 40% unit market share is likely going to take a lot longer than the market seems to expect, creating the risk that AMD's results won't be good enough to justify the now higher stock price.

AMD expects to begin shipping its Zen CPUs in volume next year, and it recently released benchmarks suggesting that the eight core PC version of the chip will be able to go toe-to-toe with Intel's best. There are a lot of problems with AMD's numbers, as pointed out by Anandtech, so we'll have to wait for independent third-party tests before having a good sense of where Zen truly stacks up.
Like with Polaris, the big risk for AMD is that Zen fails to win the strong market reception and corresponding demand that investors expect. Zen is supposed to fix the mistakes that AMD made with its current generation of CPUs, which suffer from lackluster single-threaded performance compared to Intel's products. The performance gap between the two companies will certainly narrow, aided by AMD's move to a 14nm manufacturing process -- but it may not be enough.
It's important to remember that AMD is competing with Intel, a company that has far greater resources, a near-monopoly in the server CPU market, and a dominant share of the PC CPU market. Zen being a massive success for AMD is not a foregone conclusion, although the market is pricing the stock as if it is.
With AMD stock more than quadrupling over the past year despite the fact that the company is still posting net losses each and every quarter, there's a chance that expectations have diverged from the results the company is likely to deliver. I could be wrong, of course, and both Polaris and Zen may be so successful for AMD that the current stock price proves to be pessimistic. But betting on a best-case scenario is a risky gambit. Anything short of perfection will lead to trouble for investors.

Overall, it's been a good year for semiconductors. Versus the greater Nasdaq Composite's return of 3.6%, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) has increased nearly 28%. The most interesting story in the semiconductor space is the red-hot graphics processing unit, or GPU, makers, which are outperforming the larger index by a huge margin during this period.

AMD data by YCharts.
As you can see, GPU makers NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) are outperforming the greater index by a factor of 6 and 12, respectively. Additionally, comparisons between these GPU makers and the SOX don't tell the whole story of GPU outperformance, because the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is a modified market-weighted index that includes NVIDIA -- and its 170% one-year return -- among the 30 stocks it tracks.
Even better for investors, there are still favorable tailwinds that could drive NVIDIA and AMD higher.
The incredible success of Pokemon Go points to huge demand for virtual and augmented reality. While it's important to note that the game most likely did nothing in the short term to boost either company's fortunes, the game's success nevertheless portends tremendous demand for virtual and augmented reality. This will only increase as game makers embrace the augmented- and virtual-reality formats.
Image source: Leadnet.org.
Currently, the most influential company in the virtual-reality space, Facebook's Oculus, recommends AMD R9 290 and NVIDIA's GTX 970 video cards, or greater, to ensure the full Rift experience on Oculus-ready PCs. As true virtual reality increases in popularity, and the small group of VR innovators currently using VR diffuses into the larger early adopters/opinion leaders and early majority groups (see: Rogers Diffusion of Innovation graph to the left), upgraded GPUs should be positive tailwinds for the entire industry.
Here's the point: AMD and NVIDIA are the entire industry. As Jon Peddie Research notes, in the first quarter of 2016, AMD boasted 22.8% market share, with NVIDIA taking 77.2% of the add-in graphics board market. Presented another way, AMD and NVIDIA have 100% of the add-in graphics board (read: GPU) market in the first quarter. It's unlikely either of these two companies will concede a large amount of market share to another competitor anytime soon.
It's important to note that all investments have risk. One of the key risks to both AMD and NVIDIA is slowing computer shipment figures. In June, IDC announced it expected PC shipments to fall 7.3% this year, 2 percentage points lower than earlier projections. In April, chip giant Intel announced plans to lay off up to 12,000 employees, 11% of its workforce, as the company has struggled in the wake of falling PC sales. On the surface, it would appear the factory-installed GPU market would suffer as shipments continue to fall.
However, a VR/AR increase would help GPUs offset falling PC sales in a few ways. First, VR-inspired computer upgraders will select units with higher-end, more-expensive GPUs to take advantage of VR functionality; the favorable mix should help offset the headwinds of falling factory-installed shipments figures.
Second, increased VR gaming should increase demand for non-PC chips and other VR-supportive technologies. Last quarter, AMD CEO Lisa Su specifically mentioned Microsoft's next-generation gaming console, Project Scorpio, as a design win for AMD's semi-custom chip business. NVIDIA's Iray software allows panoramic snapshots to be turned into immersive, head-mounted display VR experiences, and they should quickly grow alongside VR headsets and content.
Another risk is that both companies are considered ""expensive"" by traditional metrics. NVIDIA trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 41 times, and AMD has struggled with profitability, posting a rare quarter of GAAP profitability in the second quarter with the help of a gain on the sale of equity interests of a joint venture to China in the recently reported second quarter. However, analysts polled by Yahoo! Finance estimate annualized growth of 24% and 49%, respectively, over the next five years. If VR really is ""the next big thing"" in tech, it's likely those figures will be higher.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have been fierce rivals in the CPU market over the past few decades. Back in 2006, AMD conquered nearly half the PC market with its low-cost chips, according to PassMark Software. But over the past decade, AMD's chips fell far behind Intel's in terms of performance and power efficiency. Last quarter, AMD controlled just 18% of the market while Intel controlled 82%.

AMD's big mistake was waging two separate wars -- one in CPUs against Intel, and another in GPUs against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Both rivals had deeper pockets, enabling them to launch CPUs and GPUs which eventually outperformed AMD's. AMD stuck to the low-end CPU and GPU markets, merged CPUs and GPUs together in its APU chipsets, and diversified into embedded chips for gaming consoles, ARM-based processors for data centers, and other markets.
Intel dominated the PC and data center markets, but it gradually ran out of room to grow. Global demand for PCs started falling, due to longer upgrade cycles and the rise of smartphones and tablets. Intel paid billions in subsidies to convince smartphone makers to use its Atom chips, yet it didn't gain any ground against ARM-based leader Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Demand for Intel's data center chips also sputtered due to weaker enterprise spending and aggressive competition from rivals like IBM. Intel has diversified into new markets like the Internet of Things (IoT) and non-volatile memory, but these businesses remain small and competition remains fierce.
The past decade was disastrous for AMD, with its annual revenues dropping from $5.85 billion in 2005 to $3.99 billion in 2015. During that same period, Intel's annual revenue surged 43%. As a result, AMD stock tumbled nearly 70% over the past decade, while Intel stock has more than doubled. 
However, past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. Last quarter, AMD's revenue rose 9% annually to $1.03 billion, beating estimates by about $75 million and representing its first quarter of year-over-year growth in two full years. AMD expects revenue for the current quarter to rise 18% annually, and analysts believe that it can post 3% sales growth this year and 6% sales growth next year. 
Most of that growth will be driven by its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, Semi-Custom) business, which supplies APUs for the PS4 and Xbox One, as well as the GPU for the Wii U. Sony and Microsoft's PS4 Neo, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio hardware upgrades should continue supporting the unit's growth.

Image source: Company websites.
Intel's revenue rose just 2% annually to $13.5 billion last quarter, missing estimates by $40 million. Weak PC sales caused its Client Computing revenue to fall 3%, and data center revenue rose just 5% -- much lower than the 15% annual growth rate Intel previously targeted. Intel expects sales for the current quarter to rise another 3%, while analysts see its full-year revenue improving 4% for both fiscal 2016 and 2017. 
AMD posted a GAAP net profit of $69 million last quarter, which was a massive improvement from its loss of $181 million in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes gains from a Chinese joint venture, its net loss narrowed from $131 million to $40 million, or $0.05 per share -- exceeding expectations by three cents. Analysts expect AMD's non-GAAP earnings to rise 61% this year and grow at an average annual rate of 49% over the next five years. 
Intel's GAAP net income fell 51% to $1.3 billion last quarter due to some big acquisition-related charges. On a non-GAAP basis, net income slipped 6% to $2.9 billion, or $0.59 per share, but still beat estimates by six cents. However, much of that beat can be attributed to the $804 million Intel spent on stock buybacks during the quarter and thousands of job cuts. Analysts expect Intel's non-GAAP earnings to improve 7% this year and rise at an average rate of 5% over the next five years.
It's tough to do an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison between Intel and AMD's valuations, since the former has been consistently profitable while the latter has a negative P/E due to quarters of losses. However, AMD now trades at just 1.6 times sales, which is much lower than Intel's P/S ratio of 2.9 and the semiconductor industry average of 2.9.
AMD's better growth numbers and its lower P/S ratio indicate that it's a better buy than Intel at current prices. However, AMD can only keep growing if console sales keep rising, its GPUs can counter Nvidia's aggressively priced Pascal lineup, and the Zen CPUs dent Intel's PC market. If AMD misses those targets, it could quickly give up its gains, so it's still a much more speculative play than Intel -- which remains a decent income-generating stalwart for conservative investors.

            ","2016 has been a great comeback year for AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). The chipmaker posted 9% annual sales growth last quarter, representing its first quarter of growth in two years. It also believes sales will rise 18% for the current quarter, while analysts forecast 3% sales growth for the year. 
That growth was fueled by robust demand for its semi-custom SoCs for gaming consoles, and that momentum should continue as Sony and Microsoft roll out their PS4 Neo, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio updates. The upcoming launch of its Zen CPU for PCs could also finally enable AMD to regain some lost ground against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).

Image source: AMD.
Those positive catalysts all boosted AMD stock over 150% to a multi-year high this year, but investors shouldn't gloss over the company's missteps. Let's take a look back at AMD's biggest mistake this year -- the underwhelming launch of its RX 480 GPU -- and what the chipmaker should learn from that blunder.
To understand why the RX 480 was so disappointing, we should first discuss AMD's ongoing battle against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). After AMD bought GPU maker ATI in 2006, it claimed nearly half of the dedicated GPU market with its Radeon cards. But by the first quarter of 2016, AMD controlled just 23% of the market, according to research firm JPR, while Nvidia held the remaining 77%. 
AMD lost market share because it was fighting two tough wars -- one in x86 CPUs against Intel and another in GPUs against Nvidia. As a result, AMD lacked the R&D resources to keep pace with both rivals in chip architecture and power efficiency. To remain competitive, AMD targeted the low-end market in CPUs and GPUs, promising nearly comparable performance as Intel or Nvidia for a lower price tag. 
In GPUs, AMD boosted clock speeds instead of developing more power-efficient architectures -- which meant that AMD cards generally consumed more power and ran hotter than Nvidia ones. Those weren't attractive qualities for desktop PC gamers. But with the Polaris-based RX 460, 470, and 480 chips, AMD wanted to change that perception with a more efficient 14nm FinNET architecture. It also heavily promoted the 4GB version of the RX 480, which costs $200, as the cheapest GPU for ""VR ready"" PCs. 
The initial reviews for the RX 480 were extremely promising. Extremetech called the card the ""best $200 GPU you can buy today."" But during the RX 480's launch week, early buyers reported that the card was destroying motherboards by drawing too much power from PCIe slots. AMD quickly rectified the issue with an updated driver, but the public's first impression of the RX 480 was already tainted.
Shortly afterwards, Nvidia launched the GTX 1060, a competing ""VR ready"" card with 6GB for RAM, for $250. According to an average of several thousand benchmarks on UserBenchmark, the GTX 1060 is 11% faster than the RX 480, with 15% higher all-around performance. This puts a lot of pressure on AMD, since some gamers are probably willing to pay $50 more for 50% more RAM with 15% higher performance.
But Nvidia didn't stop there. It recently launched a 3GB variant of the GTX 1060 for $200, clearly aimed at knocking out the RX 480 as the ""best $200 GPU"" on the market. There aren't any benchmark comparisons between this new version and the RX 480 yet, but a Nvidia spokesman recently told PC World that the 3GB version of the GTX 1060 would be ""about 10% faster"" than the 8GB version of the RX 480, which costs $240. If that estimate is accurate, AMD could soon lose the low-end ""VR ready"" GPU market to Nvidia.
If Nvidia marginalizes AMD in the low-end GPU market, AMD's Computing and Graphics (CPU and GPU) revenue, which fell 15% annually last quarter, will continue declining. As a result, investors might need to wait until AMD launches its next-gen GPU Vega -- which is expected to arrive next year -- to retaliate against Nvidia. 
AMD's Polaris-based GPUs aren't bad, but they arguably can't compete effectively against Nvidia's Pascal-based GTX cards. Nvidia knows precisely how to strike AMD for maximum damage, and AMD's GPU sales might wither over the next few quarters as budget-minded gamers gravitate toward the GTX 1060.

We Fools believe that the stock market is largely rational and prices stocks appropriately the vast majority of the time, but that doesn't mean that it's always correct. Sometimes the markets may be overly bullish or bearish for any number of reasons, and if you can take an alternative stance and be proven correct, then you can be in a position to make a killing.
With that in mind, three Motley Fool contributors are sharing the one stock that they think the market is pricing incorrectly. Read on to see which stocks they picked and why they believe that the market's assessment is wrong.
Brian Feroldi: Short-sellers, or investors who bet against stocks, have placed a target on the back of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME). Currently more than 31% of the company's shares have been sold short, which indicates that many believe that this company's future is looking bleak.
At first glance it's easy to understand why so many have adopted that viewpoint. With the rise of smartphones and digital games, it's not hard to predict that the company's core business is going to be under a lot of pressure into the future.

I thought so, too, but once I started to look under the hood I realized there are plenty of reasons to believe that the market is wrong.
First, let's get the bad news out of the way. Yes, the company's physical game business is expected to continue to decline from here, but at a far slower rate than you might otherwise believe. Management is only forecasting a 6% annualized decline over the next few years. 
Before you smirk at that claim, it's worth pointing out that cutting-edge video games require a huge amount of storage capacity. The average PS4 or Xbox One video game takes up 40 gigabytes of storage space, which is a big reason why digital penetration in video games is only about 20% (versus 50% for music).  In addition, physical games can be resold in GameStop's stores, allowing the customer to recoup some cash. You can't do that with digital downloads, so those two factors should help to slow the overall decline.
But GameStop isn't simply sitting still, as it has numerous growth opportunities in place that will help to offset that decline. For one, the company is using the shift to digital games as a catalyst for growth. GameStop currently rings up more than $1 billion in sales for digital games, up a huge 263% from 2010. 
GameStop is also pushing into the collectible space by offering game-related apparel, gadgets, toys, and more at its stores. Sales are expected to be $500 million in 2015, and the company has aspirations to reach $1 billion in sales by 2020.
There's also the company's Spring Mobile and Simply Mac concepts, which sell products from AT&T and Apple. Sales from these stores are fast approaching a billion dollars, with more to come in the years ahead.
Add it all up, and management is projecting operating earnings growth of 3% to 5% annually from here. The numbers look even better on the bottom line when you consider the effects of share repurchases, as recent history has shown that the company has had success at taking down its share count.

Believe it or not, even analysts agree that this strategy is going to work. The company is projected to grow its EPS by more than 8% over the next five years. With shares trading for only 8 times trailing earnings and offering up a dividend yield of 4.7%, I can't help but think the shorts have bet against the wrong company.



Tim Green: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have surged a mesmerizing 320% over the past year, providing those betting on a turnaround with an incredible gain. The company has already launched the first of its Polaris graphics cards, meant to win back market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and it plans to release its upcoming Zen CPUs next year. Following years of share losses to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in both the PC CPU and server CPU markets, investors are banking on Zen to right the ship.
The first tangible signs of a turnaround surfaced when AMD reported its second-quarter results. The company managed to grow revenue year over year, and while AMD still posted a significant net loss, margins improved. The bull case that has been driving the stock higher over the past year is simple: Polaris and Zen will allow AMD to win back market share from NVIDIA and Intel, heralding in a new era of growth and profitability for the company.
The bear case is also simple, especially following the stock's massive gains over the past year: Both Polaris and Zen will face plenty of competition, and significant market share gains are far from guaranteed. NVIDIA has already launched the GTX 1060, a mainstream competitor to AMD's RX 480, and competitive lower-end cards from NVIDIA are likely later this year. And Intel, which has a near monopoly in the server CPU market, outspends AMD on R&D by a factor of 13. It's certainly not impossible for AMD to stage a triumphant comeback, but I think the market is getting way ahead of itself.
John Rosevear: Here are two charts for your consideration. The first shows General Motors' (NYSE:GM) operating profit margin, excluding special items, in every quarter since the beginning of 2014. (Yes, General Motors. Bear with me here, it's a good story.)

Second, here's how GM's stock price has performed over the same period.

GM data by YCharts.
Interesting, no?
Full disclosure: I did cheat somewhat by choosing a cherry-picked time period. GM's margin in the first half of 2014 were clobbered by the costs of its ignition-switch recall mess, so the slope of the increase looks particularly dramatic. But I only cheated a little: The trend overall has been upward since GM's first post-IPO quarter in 2012, when its margin was around 5.8%.
In fact, last quarter's 9.3% margin was a record. It's not a fluke, either: CEO Mary Barra is driving a series of long-term initiatives (learn more about them here) that are intended to put GM's margin into the 9% to 10% range sustainably by early next decade. There may well turn out to be a sizable increase in revenue (and therefore profits) along the way, too.

It's true that GM was the poster child of the bad old days of Detroit. But that GM is long gone: Over the last few years, GM's quality ratings have skyrocketed, it has emerged as a leader in electric cars and self-driving technology, and it has become much more shareholder-friendly.
What do I mean? Old GM talked about market share and its long-gone glory days as the world's largest-selling automaker, while ignoring the advances made by its rivals. Barra and her team talk about return on invested capital, about returning excess cash to shareholders, about out-disrupting Silicon Valley, and about becoming the world's most profitable automaker.
It's a great story that much of Wall Street seems to be overlooking. The upshot is that right now, GM is dirt cheap: It's trading at just 4 times trailing-12-month earnings, with a dividend yield of almost 4.7%. (Read why that dividend is probably sustainable through a recession.) 
Investors are worried about a near-term slowdown in the U.S. new-car market, but GM's longer-term prospects are very bright. For a patient investor, this one's worth a close look.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 33.5% in July 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Some of the boost came from a solid second-quarter report and all the analyst love that followed. The rest was fueled by buyout speculation and a rosy analysis of AMD's future chip designs.
So what: In the second quarter, AMD's revenue rose 9% year over year. The microchip designer reported a net loss of $0.05 per share, but analysts were expecting about twice as much red ink. Several analyst firms issued bullish reports based on this report, and share prices rose more than 14% the next day.
That gain took place on a Friday, near the end of July. Come Monday, AMD shares raced another 15% higher. One analyst firm speculated that the company could be the target of a buyout attempt. That angle was supported by a successful launch of the new Polaris graphics chip architecture, which looks capable of keeping AMD competitive in this generation of the graphics wars.

AMD data by YCharts.
Now what: AMD shares have now more than doubled in 2016 and tripled over the last 52 weeks. The company is not easy to pin down with simple price-to-earnings metrics, since the bottom line remains negative. The chip underdog has sported positive free cash flows over the last four quarters, but that $107.5 million windfall works out to an enterprise value-to-cash flow ratio of a sky-high 61. By contrast, archrivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) have EV/FCF ratios of 15.2 and 27.9, respectively.
In other words, AMD's valuation is riding high and the company is under tremendous pressure to deliver strong growth and improving profitability if it wants to defend these share prices. The expensive nature of this stock also makes it a less likely takeover target, assuming that the prospective buyers care about paying a fair price.
This stock has been downright exciting to watch in recent quarters, but I'm not convinced that AMD's rally has staying power. I'd suggest watching this one from the sidelines, at least until AMD can prove that it has a clear path to sustainable profits.

            ","Investors might think that it's tough to find tech stocks that can double within a year. But over the past year, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) all accomplished that feat, and could keep rallying. Let's see how these three companies delivered such big returns in such a short time.
Nvidia stock has soared more than 150% over the past 12 months for three reasons. First, it dominates the PC gaming market with its GeForce cards, and demand within that niche market is rising as more graphically intensive games hit the market. That market is also well insulated from the global slowdown in PC shipments. 

Image source: Nvidia.
Second, its GPUs are being installed in an increasing number of data centers for machine learning purposes, since they can process certain science applications at a faster rate than Intel's industry-standard Xeon processors. Lastly, Nvidia pivoted its Tegra mobile chips toward connected cars, which gave it a firm foothold in infotainment systems and onboard computers for autonomous vehicles. 
These strategies all boosted Nvidia's sales growth from single-digit to double-digit levels over the past few quarters as its non-GAAP gross margins expanded. Looking ahead, analysts expect Nvidia's growth to continue with 12% sales growth and 46% earnings growth this fiscal year. 
Shares of AMD have surged 210% over the past 12 months, which is surprising because its CPU and GPU businesses were marginalized by Intel and Nvidia, respectively. AMD sold cheaper chips than both rivals, but they usually lagged behind both in terms of chip architecture and power efficiency. 
But over the past few years, AMD made a comeback by investing heavily in EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) chips for non-PC platforms. The unit's semi-custom SoCs now power the PS4 and Xbox One, and its GPU powers the Wii U. The unit has also been expanding into data centers with ARM-based 64-bit chips.

Image source: Company websites.
That strategic shift paid off, and AMD posted 9% year-over-year sales growth during the second quarter of this year, marking its first quarter of annual sales growth since the second quarter of 2014. It also expects that growth to continue with 18% sales growth for the current quarter. While AMD still faces tough battles ahead in the GPU and CPU markets, that positive growth was enough to propel the stock to four-year highs.
Silicon Motion is a Taiwanese chipmaker that produces flash controller ICs (integrated circuits) for storage products and RF (radio frequency) ICs for mobile devices. In the storage market, its ICs are installed in solid state drives, flash memory cards, USB drives, embedded multimedia cards, and connected cars. In the mobile market, its ICs are used in smartphones, tablets, and PCs. 
Since Silicon Motion only provides the controller for the flash storage devices, it isn't exposed to the decline in memory prices which has hurt flash storage companies like Micron. Growth across that larger unit has offset declines at its smaller RF business.
Silicon Motion's revenue and non-GAAP earnings grew at their fastest rate in the company's history last quarter. Revenue rose 61% year-over-year, up from 40% growth in the previous quarter and 26% growth a year ago. Non-GAAP net earnings improved 26% sequentially and 69% annually. Analysts expect that impressive growth to continue with 45% sales growth and 55% earnings growth this year. Those explosive figures explain why the stock has rallied 120% over the past 12 months.
But before investors go chasing Nvidia, AMD, and Silicon Motion Technology, they should check their valuations to see if they're overpriced. 
Nvidia currently trades at 50 times earnings, which is notably lower than the average P/E of 75 for the specialized semiconductor industry. Its forward P/E of 36 is also lower than its projected earnings growth rate for the year. This means that if Nvidia beats analysts estimates over the next few quarters, its stock could still be undervalued at today's prices.
AMD isn't profitable, but its P/S ratio of 1.3 still looks low. Nvidia and Intel respectively trade at 1.7 and 2.9 times sales, so AMD could be undervalued if it keeps posting year-over-year sales growth. Silicon Motion trades at 24 times earnings, which is much higher than the industry average of 15 for diversified electronics companies. But its forward P/E of 14 is much lower than its projected earnings growth rate, so Silicon Motion could still have room to run.
Investors shouldn't avoid stocks just because they've doubled or tripled over the past year. But they should do their homework to see if the positive sentiment which fueled those rallies is sustainable, and if their valuations are still supported by their long-term growth potential.

            ","While hundreds of companies will report quarterly results in August, there are two that stand out. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), the leader in the graphics card market, will need to keep up its recent pace of growth in order to justify its increasingly lofty valuation. And brick-and-mortar retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), faced with a tectonic shift toward e-commerce, has its hands full returning to earnings growth while taking on the Amazon.com juggernaut. Here's what investors need to know about these two companies.

Image source: NVIDIA.
NVIDIA has consolidated its lead in the discrete graphics card market over the past two years, claiming a nearly 80% unit market share during the first quarter and leaving Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with the scraps. At the same time, NVIDIA's push into the data center, pitching its GPUs as ideal accelerators for artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks, has created a fast-growing business for the company.
NVIDIA will report its second-quarter results after the market close on Aug. 11. The stock has been on fire over the past year, up about 175%, as investors have increasingly bet that the company's profits will soar in the future. NVIDIA is at the center of a buzzword trifecta -- artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and self-driving cars -- and investors can't get enough of the company's stock.
With NVIDIA stock now trading for more than 50 times last year's earnings, the company will need to impress when it reports its second-quarter results. Sales of its high-end gaming GPUs have been consistently strong, and that's unlikely to change with AMD offering no real alternative at the moment. But further market share gains will be tough, especially with AMD going after the mainstream portion of the market aggressively. And NVIDIA's growth businesses, including data center and automotive, are still small relative to the core PC GPU business.
With the stock priced at an optimistic level, NVIDIA will need to show that it can produce the earnings growth that investors are expecting.

Image source: Wal-Mart.
Retail behemoth Wal-Mart expects its earnings to decline during the second quarter, results for which it will announce on Aug. 18. The company has been making major investments in higher wages for its employees, new training programs, and e-commerce, sacrificing profits in the short-term in an effort to drive growth and customer satisfaction in the long-term. Wal-Mart expects to produce between $0.95 and $1.08 in per-share earnings, compared to $1.08 during the second quarter of last year.
Already, some of these initiatives are bearing fruit. The U.S. business has reported positive comparable sales for seven quarters in a row, and customer service scores are improving. The e-commerce business is growing, albeit slowly, as Wal-Mart expands initiatives like its ShippingPass program and its online grocery pickup service.
Wal-Mart's $3 billion acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet demonstrates how much of a priority online sales have become for the company. Jet launched last year to substantial buzz, promising to undercut Amazon on price by offering discounts based on how many items shoppers buy. With the Jet acquisition, Wal-Mart is following the same strategy that it always has -- offering the lowest prices possible.
Investors shouldn't expect much improvement when it comes to profitability anytime soon, as Wal-Mart doesn't expect meaningful earnings growth to return until fiscal 2019. But the company needs to keep showing progress, particularly positive comparable sales growth in its U.S. business. A surprise drop in sales would likely undo some of the stock's gains this year.

            ","The past decade wasn't kind to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), which ceded the x86 CPU market to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and lost the GPU market to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). AMD's CPUs and GPUs were cheaper, but they always seemed to lag behind Intel and Nvidia in terms of architecture and power efficiency. 

Image source: AMD investor presentation.
Between 2005 and 2015, AMD's annual revenue dropped from $5.85 billion to $3.99 billion. During that same period, Intel's annual revenue rose 43% and Nvidia's revenue more than doubled. AMD lost nearly 70% of its market value over the past decade and went through three CEOs before Lisa Su took over in late 2014. 
But under Su, AMD recently scored a major victory during its second quarter by achieving its first period of annual sales growth since the second quarter of 2014. Sales rose 9% to $1.03 billion during the quarter, beating estimates by about $75 million. AMD expects that growth to continue with about 18% sales growth for the third quarter. That news lifted AMD stock to four-year highs. 
Over the past few years, AMD realized that attacking Intel and Nvidia head-on was futile, since both companies had superior cash flows and higher R&D and marketing budgets. Instead, AMD pivoted toward certain niche markets which its rivals had overlooked. 
In 2013, it scored design wins with Sony and Microsoft to respectively power the PS4 and Xbox One with its semi-custom APUs -- which combine the functions of a CPU and GPU on a single SoC (system on chip). It also supplied the GPU for Nintendo's Wii U, which effectively locked Nvidia out of the eighth generation of gaming consoles. 

All powered by AMD. Image source: Company websites.
Sales of semi-custom SoCs for consoles became a pillar of growth for AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which generated 58% of its sales last quarter. Revenue at the unit rose 5% annually and operating income more than tripled to $84 million. That growth offset an $81 million operating loss at its computing and graphics business. Looking ahead, the EESC business will likely get a boost from new updated consoles like Sony's PS4 Neo and Microsoft's Xbox One S and Scorpio.
AMD also sees niche growth potential in data centers, a market which Intel dominates with its Xeon processors. Instead of competing against Intel with x86 CPUs for high-end servers, AMD has started shipping ARM licensed chips for lower-end servers. To complement that move, AMD formed a joint venture with Chinese firm THATIC earlier this year to develop SoCs for the Chinese server market. It also formed another joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics to expand its ATMP (assembly, test, mark, and pack) capabilities in China.
Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that the fledgling virtual reality market could grow from practically nothing today to $30 billion by 2020. That growth could benefit AMD in two major ways.
When the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were launched earlier this year, consumers had to buy a $1,000 PC to use the headsets. Since the Rift costs $600 and the Vive costs $800, VR remained a hobby for rich tech enthusiasts instead of mainstream consumers. However, AMD recently lowered the price of VR-ready PCs considerably with its $200 RX 480, the cheapest VR-capable card on the market. Current PC builds using the RX 480 have reduced the price of a VR-ready PC to just $600. 
The Rift and Vive currently depend on the PC's GPU power, but companies will likely launch stand-alone headsets which aren't tethered to desktops in the near future. Like gaming consoles, these devices will run better on efficient semi-custom APUs instead of stand-alone CPUs and GPUs. AMD's market-dominating position in semi-custom APUs for consoles gives it a major advantage in this market.
Posting 9% sales growth might not seem like a huge victory, but it's certainly AMD's biggest win of the year so far. However, investors shouldn't ignore three upcoming challenges that could derail AMD's turnaround. 
First, Nvidia's new GTX cards offer a lot of power for just a little more cash. The new GTX 1060, for example, offers better performance than the RX 480 for just $50 more. Second, AMD must prove that its Zen x86 chips, which will arrive at the end of the year, can effectively compete against Intel's upcoming Kaby Lake and stop the bleeding at its CPU business. Lastly, Nintendo has reportedly selected Nvidia's Tegra to power its upcoming NX console, which will likely arrive next March. If the NX is a surprise hit like the original Wii, it could hurt sales of the PS4 and Xbox One and AMD's EESC sales. 
I think AMD's outlook is improving, but I'd be hesitant to call it a ""turnaround"" until it can overcome those challenges. But if AMD's revenues can continue growing year-over-year for the next few quarters, it could be the start of a major comeback for the beaten-down chipmaker.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) returned to revenue growth during the second quarter, showing signs of progress that have been absent for years. The company is still losing money, but new product launches this year and next have the potential to turn around AMD's fortunes. While much can be gleaned from AMD's financial results, management's commentary during the company's conference call provided some invaluable information for investors. Here are four quotes, taken from a transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.
AMD launched its first Polaris graphics card, the RX 480, in late June. With an MSRP of either $199 or $239 depending on the amount of memory, the RX 480 is aimed squarely at the high-volume mainstream portion of the market. So far, AMD CEO Lisa Su is happy with the launch:
We are pleased with the Polaris launch, initial channel sales, and OEM design wins. We expect this strong demand to continue and help drive revenue growth in the third quarter with the launch of the RX 470 and RX 460 desktop GPUs, and Polaris-based notebooks from our OEM customers.
The RX 480 and its lower-end companions will help drive AMD's graphics business during the second half of the year. AMD's unit share of the discrete graphics card market has tumbled over the past two years. During the first quarter of 2016, AMD shipped just 22.8% of discrete graphics cards, according to Jon Peddie Research, down from around 40% during the first quarter of 2014.
Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has lapped up the market share that AMD has lost, launched a mainstream graphics card of its own in July. The GTX 1060 is priced at $249, but according to NVIDIA it offers substantially better performance and efficiency than AMD's RX 480. AMD expects to grow its graphics business during the second half, but it remains to be seen how much market share it will be able to wrestle back from NVIDIA.
The semi-custom business has been a major success for AMD. The company's SoCs (system on a chip) power both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, providing a reliable source of revenue. As game console inventory is built up for the holiday season, Su expects the third quarter to be strongest for the segment:
As in the previous two years, we expect semi-custom shipments to peak for the year in the third quarter, as both Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holidays. Based on strong demand, we believe semi-custom unit shipments and revenue will grow on an annual basis.
In addition to the game console business, AMD will begin to recognize revenue from two additional semi-custom design wins during the second half of the year. AMD expects each deal to generate roughly $500 million of revenue spread across three to four years, enough for the semi-custom segment to grow in 2016. Another semi-custom design win, Microsoft's Project Scorpio console, will begin generating revenue for AMD in 2017.
AMD's upcoming Zen CPUs are expected to improve the company's competitive position relative to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The first PC variants should start shipping toward the end of this year, with significant volume in 2017. The server market may represent an even larger opportunity for AMD, given that Intel currently enjoys a near-monopoly. Su gave a progress update:
We are pleased with the performance we are seeing with Zen hardware, which is helping to expand our customer engagements and accelerating design win momentum across multiple OEMs and ODMs. We remain on track for volume shipments of our Zen server CPU in the first half of 2017.
Intel's corporate strategy now revolves around the cloud and the data center, with PCs remaining an important but shrinking focus. The company's data center segment has been the company's growth engine as the PC market has sputtered, and AMD will undoubtedly face major challenges getting its server chips into cloud data centers currently dominated by Intel.
The good news for AMD is that Intel's pace of moving to smaller process nodes has slowed, with the company abandoning its ""tick-tock"" strategy for an elongated three-step approach. AMD's manufacturing disadvantage will be narrowed with the launch of Zen, and that should help the company make some headway in the server chip market.
Despite the progress AMD has made, the company is still posting significant losses. The company reported a free cash flow loss of $322 million during 2015, a pace that threatened to deplete AMD's cash reserves in just a couple of years.
AMD has taken some steps to shore up its balance sheet, and the result is a larger cushion that gives the company more time to turn itself around. CFO Devinder Kumar explained:
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $957 million at the end of the quarter, up $241 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to net cash proceeds from the ATMP JV transaction, offset by working capital needs in the quarter.
AMD announced a deal to sell its assembly and test facilities to a newly created joint venture last year, which brought in a total of $371 million in cash. Inventory buildup for the second half offset some of these gains, but the net result has been an influx of cash that gives AMD some much needed breathing room. The company is no longer at risk of running low on cash anytime soon.
It now appears that AMD's financial performance has bottomed out. Revenue is growing again, and losses are beginning to shrink. A return to GAAP profitability may still be distant, but the company's balance sheet is in a better position to handle the second phase of AMD's turnaround.

Virtual reality is one of the more exciting trends in technology. The industry remains in its infancy, but several companies are positioning themselves to take advantage of the growing demand for VR headsets and content. Facebook and NVIDIA are popular picks, and for good reason: Both companies could play major roles in the VR economy.
But unfortunately, both stocks are expensive, Facebook perhaps exceptionally so. Investors looking for a bargain might consider AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) or Sony (NYSE:SNE) instead.
If you want to use a high-end virtual reality headset, such as Facebook's Oculus Rift or HTC's Vive, you'll need a PC equipped with a powerful graphics card. Right now, there are only two companies offering such a card, and AMD is one of them. That gives it an opportunity to grow its graphics business substantially in the months and years ahead.
AMD's share of the graphics card market lags behind that of market leader NVIDIA by a sizable percentage. In the first quarter of the year, AMD captured just 22.8% of the market compared to NVIDIA's 77.2%, according to Jon Peddie Research. But AMD has an opportunity to claw back market share by capturing the low-end segment.
AMD's Radeon RX 480 has received fairly strong reviews since it went on sale late last month. The graphics card is capable of powering today's virtual reality headsets, while retailing for just $199. That makes it the most affordable virtual reality-capable graphics card on the market, as NVIDIA's competing GTX 1060 is 25% more expensive.
AMD could also benefit from Sony's forthcoming PlayStation VR. The Japanese gaming giant's VR headset plugs into its PlayStation 4 video game console rather than a PC. Gamers who wish to use Sony's headset won't need to buy powerful graphics cards; instead, they just need consoles. AMD's chips power the PlayStation 4, and increased demand for the console could translate into additional revenue.
From a valuation perspective, AMD is inexpensive. Admittedly, it isn't profitable, and after rallying upwards of 45% in the last four weeks, it isn't as cheap as it was when I recommended it last month. Still, its enterprise value to trailing revenue hovers near 1.7, considerably lower than Facebook's and NVIDIA's. Its trailing price-to-sales ratio, at just 1.4, is similarly modest.
Increased demand for the PlayStation 4 could benefit AMD, but as the maker of the console, Sony could capitalize to an even greater extent. To date, the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 40 million units, and that's helped Sony reward shareholders. Year-to-date, Sony shares have risen more than 23%, outperforming the broader market.
In its fiscal year ended March 31, Sony's video game business generated less than 19% of its revenue, but brought in almost one-third of its operating income. If Sony's guidance proves accurate, it will bring in 45% of its operating income this fiscal year.
PlayStation VR will make its retail debut on Oct. 13. It will work with existing PlayStation 4 consoles, but could also entice some gamers to upgrade. Although Sony has yet to formally unveil it, it has confirmed that it plans to release an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 at some point in the near future. That extra horsepower could dramatically improve the VR experience.
At $399, the PlayStation VR is expensive, but is cheaper than other competing solutions (Facebook's Oculus Rift retails for $599). By itself, the PlayStation 4 is less expensive than a high-powered PC with a capable graphics card, and is easier for the average consumer to setup and use. Moreover, Sony has video game studios and partnerships it can leverage to create quality content for its headset.
Trading with a price-to-earnings ratio near 32, Sony may not look like a bargain, but it's cheaper than other names in the space. And on the basis of other valuation metrics, including enterprise value-to-trailing revenues and price-to-sales, Sony is cheaper than AMD.
Of course, Sony is a complex business with many other segments, but with gaming accounting for an increasing share of Sony's earnings, VR could emerge as a key driver for the stock in the years ahead.

            ","Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) upcoming NX console could be a portable device with detachable controllers, according to Eurogamer. If the report is accurate, the NX's core device would resemble the Wii U GamePad, but function as a stand-alone handheld on the go. However, it will be possible to remove the controllers on the sides from the screen, and plug the base unit into a TV for big-screen gaming.

The NX looks like an extension of the Wii U concept, but addresses the fact that the Wii U GamePad couldn't work as a stand-alone handheld if it wasn't in range of the console. The NX will also reportedly use game cartridges with flash memory instead of optical discs. This makes sense, since loading times are faster and the price of flash memory has declined dramatically, but the 32GB cartridges which Nintendo is recommending could be too small for many modern games.
Those revelations surprised many gamers, who had expected Nintendo to launch a beefier console to challenge Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One. However, the reports about the NX included a pleasant surprise for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) investors -- the device could be powered by its Tegra processors instead of AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD).
Nvidia's Tegra processors were originally designed to challenge Qualcomm in the mobile market. But when it realized that most OEMs wouldn't use Tegra chips, Nvidia pivoted the Tegra line toward Android gaming devices, set-top boxes, and infotainment and telematics systems for cars. 
In recent quarters, demand from the automotive industry has been the core driver of Tegra sales, which rose 10% annually to $160 million (12% of Nvidia's top line) last quarter. Within that total, automotive chip sales rose 47% to $113 million. That growth convinced many investors that connected cars were much more important than Android consoles or set-top boxes to Tegra's future.
The last time Nvidia had a stake in the console market was with the PS3, which was powered by a proprietary GPU it co-developed with Sony. But when the eighth generation of consoles (PS4, Xbox One, Wii U) arrived, all three console makers installed AMD's hardware instead of Nvidia's. 
Sony and Microsoft installed AMD APUs -- which merged CPUs and GPUs together in semi-custom system on chips (SoCs) -- in the PS4 and Xbox One. Nintendo paired an IBM PowerPC processor with an AMD GPU in the Wii U. AMD saw the shutout as a major victory for its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which offset its slower sales of CPUs and GPUs for PCs. 
Nvidia claimed that it ""let"" AMD conquer the console market because the margins were too thin. AMD called Nvidia's declaration a case of ""sour grapes"". Since then, Nvidia's presence in gaming has been an uneven one -- early Tegra-powered Android consoles like the Ouya flopped, while its Shield handheld, tablet, and set-top boxes remain niche devices.

The upgraded PS4 (PS4 Neo) and Xbox One (Scorpio) -- which will be launched with 4K and VR games in mind -- will likely run on upgraded versions of AMD's custom APUs. This means that Nvidia's only way back into the console market is through Nintendo.
Unfortunately, Nintendo has been a laggard in the home console wars. According to industry tracking site Vgchartz, Sony has sold 42.5 million PS4s worldwide, compared to 21.8 million Xbox Ones and 13.2 million Wii Us. But if we include Nintendo's 3DS handheld in the ""eighth generation"", it's actually the best-selling console with 58.7 million units sold. 
Nintendo is trying to leverage its strength in handhelds to straddle the handheld and home console markets with the hybrid NX. Since Nvidia basically tried the same thing with its Tegra-powered Shield tablet -- which converts into an Android ""console"" when hooked up to a TV and a wireless controller -- its CPU (which includes an integrated GPU) is a natural fit for the NX. Using a more power-efficient mobile processor like the Tegra is also necessary to boost the NX's battery life when used as a handheld.
However, Nintendo will likely sacrifice graphical horsepower by using a Tegra instead of an AMD APU. This indicates that Nintendo is more interested in creating a ""unique"" device instead of competing against the PS4, Xbox One, and PC. This means that third-party developers could shun the device, as they did with the Wii U, and force Nintendo to rely mainly on first-party titles. But if the NX is a surprise hit like the original Wii, third-party developers should flock back.
Nintendo's NX might boost sales of Tegra chips when it arrives next year, but it probably won't overtake the importance of connected cars to overall Tegra sales. It probably also won't be a stepping stone back into Sony or Microsoft consoles, since AMD has the market locked down pretty tight with its high-performance APUs.

Growth returned to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) during the second quarter, with the company reporting far higher revenue than analysts were expecting. AMD still posted a loss after backing out a one-time gain from the formation of its assembly and testing joint venture, but that loss was smaller compared to the prior-year period.
The stock surged on the news, with investors betting that AMD's second-quarter results foretell a turnaround during the second half of the year. While AMD showed progress, there are still a few items that need to fall into place before AMD will be able to produce sustained growth and return to profitability. Here's what investors need to know about AMD's second quarter.
AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $1.03 billion, up 9% year over year and $69 million higher than analysts were expecting. The computing and graphics segment, which includes the company's PC CPUs and GPUs, generated $435 million of revenue, up 15% year over year. AMD attributed the increase in sales to higher demand for its notebook processors and GPUs.
The semi-custom segment, which includes game console SoCs as well as embedded and enterprise products, produced $592 million of revenue during the quarter, up 5% year over year. As AMD's share of a shrinking PC market has declined in recent years, its semi-custom business has been a bright spot for the company. The second quarter was no exception.
AMD produced a non-GAAP loss of $40 million, or $0.05 per share, down from a loss of $131 million, or $0.17 per share, during the prior-year period. The average analyst estimate called for a loss of $0.08 per share. Non-GAAP operating profit was positive at $3 million, a milestone that AMD heralded in its earnings press release. The company had previously projected that it would return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second half of the year.
On a GAAP basis, AMD produced an operating loss of $8 million and a net profit of $69 million, or $0.08 per share. A one-time gain of $150 million related to the company's assembly and test joint venture boosted GAAP earnings. Excluding this gain and the related taxes, GAAP net income would have been a loss of about $54 million.
Improvements in profitability came from both segments. The computing and graphics segment produced an operating loss of $81 million, down from a loss of $147 million during the prior-year period. The semi-custom segment offset that loss with an $84 million operating profit, up from just $27 million, with $11 million of operating costs not attributed to either segment. Higher revenue and gross margin, as well as a $26 million licensing gain, drove the improvements compared to the same period last year.
AMD expects its revenue to grow sequentially by 18% during the third quarter, to roughly $1.21 billion. That would represent year-over-year revenue growth of about 14% if AMD hits its guidance. The third quarter is always the strongest for the semi-custom business, with game console inventory being built up for the holiday season, but AMD expects to report year-over-year growth in that segment as well.
AMD reiterated its guidance for revenue growth in 2016 and non-GAAP operating profitability during the second half of the year. Strong semi-custom sales along with the launch of AMD's Polaris graphics cards are expected to drive the company's results. The RX 480, a mainstream card, was launched at the end of June, and AMD will be filling out its lineup of Polaris graphics cards throughout the rest of the year.
While a return to revenue growth and non-GAAP profitability are two important steps in AMD's turnaround, producing GAAP profits excluding one-time gains will require the company to increase its revenue further. Polaris may help AMD win some market share back from NVIDIA, which has built a commanding lead over the past couple of years in the graphics card market. And Zen, AMD's upcoming line of CPUs, is expected to make the company more competitive against Intel.
The success of Polaris and Zen will ultimately determine whether AMD's turnaround gains traction. If either fails to live up to expectations, the signs of progress AMD reported during the second quarter may not mean much in the long run. For now, though, AMD investors are rightfully celebrating the first genuinely positive results from AMD in quite some time.

What: Shares of semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose sharply for the second trading day in a row on Monday, climbing as much as 19%. The stock closed the trading day up 14.7%, or up a total of 28.4% in the past two trading days. The move follows the company's better-than-expected second-quarter results reported after the market closed on Thursday.
So what: AMD stock's move on Monday could be related to continued optimism about the company's second-quarter earnings report, which featured a narrower-than-expected loss per share and higher-than-expected revenue. Further, AMD returned to non-GAAP operating profits one quarter earlier than management had indicated it would.
But other speculation is floating around on Monday, which may have driven some of the optimism surrounding the stock. In particular, Forbes contributor Patrick Moorhead reported AMD sent him a note when he inquired about the company's 14nm chip plans, which he asserts makes him more confident in the company's chip plans. The article can be read in full here.
Now what: Investors should refrain from jumping to any new conclusions about the company based on an analyst note. Investors who are interested in Moorhead's conclusions should reach out directly to the company to verify these facts, or wait for management to confirm what Moorhead is reporting.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has been fighting a losing war against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in high-end GPUs over the past decade. AMD controlled nearly half the dedicated GPU market back in 2006. But by the first quarter of 2016, AMD controlled just 23% of the market, according to research firm JPR, while Nvidia controlled the remaining 77%.
The bears believe that AMD will fall behind Nvidia in GPUs and Intel in CPUs, and end up pigeonholed in niche markets like embedded processors. But there's also a more bullish narrative anchored in virtual reality.

In that thesis, console and headset makers will use AMD's APUs (which combine CPUs and GPUs), because they're generally more cost effective than stand-alone CPUs and GPUs. AMD's new ""VR-ready"" add-in graphics boards could also enable consumers to build cheaper PCs which can run apps for high-end headsets like Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift or HTC and Valve's Vive. Let's discuss that second theory, and see if AMD can challenge Nvidia in the low-end VR-ready GPU market.
AMD's cheapest VR-ready GPU is the RX 480, which has a base clock speed of 1.3 Ghz, 4GB of VRAM, and costs $200. Nvidia's competing device is the GTX 1060, which has a base clock speed of 1.5 Ghz, 6GB of memory, and costs $250.
Early benchmarks on the two devices at PCEVA indicate that the 1060 offers 6%-7% better graphics performance on the latest version of 3DMark's Time Spy DirectX 12 benchmark. Those results are encouraging for AMD, since some customers might question the value of paying 25% more for a 7% performance boost.
They're also better than the ""leaked"" 3DMark Firestrike benchmarks from XFastest in early July, which indicated that the 1060 could outperform the RX 480 by 15%. However, future benchmarks which fully utilize the GTX 1060's higher VRAM could reveal a bigger performance gap between the two cards.

AMD investors should also be wary of two headwinds. First, Nvidia's growth over the past decade has been fueled by robust brand loyalty for its GeForce cards. This arguably enables it to charge a premium on its devices without losing market share to AMD. 
Second, Nvidia has a strong track record of launching more advanced and power efficient chip architectures before AMD. AMD has generally tried to keep pace by boosting clock speeds instead of developing new architectures, which occasionally leads to overheating problems. AMD addressed this perception with a more power efficient 14nm FinNET architecture in its latest GPUs, but the initial launch of the RX 480 was marred by power draw issues -- which were subsequently resolved with a new driver.
Facebook, HTC, Valve, and other PC-based VR headset makers need the price of GPUs to decline to make VR-ready PCs more affordable. Prior to the launch of the RX 480 and GTX 1060, the average price of a VR-ready PC was roughly $1,000. Adding the $600 Oculus Rift or the $800 Vive to that rig made the entire setup a toy for rich gadget enthusiasts instead of mainstream consumers.
New gaming PC builds using the RX 480 or GTX 1060, however, have already reduced the average price to around $700. While that still keeps the price tag of the VR experience well above $1,000, it might attract more mainstream consumers who were looking to upgrade their aging PCs. The prices of Nvidia and AMD's VR-ready cards will likely decline over the next two years, which will make VR-compatible a standard feature on most PCs. 
If that happens, the VR market could grow from nearly nothing today to $30 billion by 2020, as tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital predicts. Headset sales could soar to half a billion units by 2025, according to Piper Jaffray's estimates. 
Nvidia has two distinct advantages over AMD. First, it's allocating most of its R&D and sales/marketing expenses on its GPU business. AMD, however, must allocate those expenses to three fronts -- its GPU battle with Nvidia, its CPU battle with Intel, and its expansion in enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) processors. Nvidia's GAAP operating expenses were nearly 50% higher than AMD's last quarter -- indicating that it has much more cash for big marketing blitzes. 
Second, Nvidia had a GAAP gross margin of 57.5% last quarter, compared to AMD's gross margin of 32%. This means that if AMD gains market share against Nvidia, Nvidia can dramatically lower its prices to regain lost ground. This would be bad for both chipmakers' margins, but gamers and VR headsets would benefit from the arrival of cheaper VR-ready GPUs.
Nvidia has clear advantages in the VR-ready GPU battle, but AMD will likely hold its ground with considerably cheaper GPUs with just slightly lower specs. Therefore, it's unlikely that Nvidia will flush AMD out of the market, but it's equally unlikely that AMD will steal much market share away from Nvidia without triggering a major price war.

            ","What: After Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported better-than-expected second-quarter results on Thursday following the market close, shares of the semiconductor company jumped as much as 14.4% on Friday, and are up 12% at the time of this writing. This extends the stock's incredible performance recently; shares are up about 190% in the past six months.

So what: Investors are likely upbeat about AMD because the company's loss per share was narrower than expected, and its revenue was higher than expected. Adjusted to exclude one-time items, AMD reported a loss of $0.05 per share, better than analysts' consensus estimate for an $0.08 loss. Revenue increased 9% to $1.027 billion -- above analysts' consensus estimate for revenue of $951.3 million. Further, the company returned to non-GAAP operating profitability one quarter ahead of schedule, reporting non-GAAP operating income of $3 million.
""In the second quarter we accomplished a significant milestone as we returned to non-GAAP operating profitability based on solid execution and strong demand for our semi-custom and graphics products,"" said CEO Lisa Su.
Now what: Going forward, Su is optimistic, expecting strength in the company's semi-custom products and its latest Radeon RX and 7th Generation A-Series APUs ""to drive growth and market share gains in the second half of the year.""

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) launched the first of its long-awaited Polaris graphics cards in June, raising hopes that a turnaround was right around the corner. That turnaround won't be evident in the company's second-quarter results, though, as the RX 480 came at the very beginning of the third quarter. AMD is set to report its second-quarter numbers after the market close on Thursday, July 21. Here's what investors need to know.
AMD managed to beat analyst estimates on all fronts in April when it reported its first-quarter results. Revenue came in at $832 million, down 19% year over year but about $13 million higher than the average analyst estimate. On a non-GAAP basis, AMD posted a loss of $0.12 per share. That number was worse than the $0.09-per-share loss in the prior-year period, but it was a penny better than analysts were expecting.
Along with beating first-quarter expectations, AMD provided guidance for the second quarter that was above what analysts predicted. AMD anticipates growing revenue on a sequential basis by 15%, well above the 7% growth that the average analyst estimate called for.
The biggest news had nothing to do with AMD's results. The company announced that it had licensed its processor and SoC intellectual property to a newly created joint venture targeting the Chinese server market. AMD will receive $293 million in licensing fees, contingent on the JV achieving certain milestones, in addition to royalty payments from future sales.
AMD will be launching new server chips next year based on its upcoming Zen microarchitecture, and the JV offers a second path for AMD to claw back market share. In the near term, the deal bolsters AMD's balance sheet and gives the company more time to turn itself around. In the long term, it improves AMD's chances of reasserting itself in the server chip market.
After a rough few years, analysts forecast that AMD will post growth during the second quarter. The average estimate calls for a 1% year-over-year increase in revenue to $951.6 million, up from $942 million during the prior-year period and in-line with the company's guidance.
AMD is still expected to post a loss, although analysts expect an improvement in that area as well. The average estimate calls for a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, substantially better than the $0.17-per-share loss AMD reported during the same period last year.
Analysts are expecting AMD's results to improve later this year and next year, driven by both Polaris and Zen. The average estimate calls for 0.9% revenue growth in 2016, followed by 5.4% revenue growth in 2017.
AMD's Polaris graphics cards, which target the mainstream portion of the market, won't have an impact on AMD's results until the third quarter. But investors should look for management to give an update on the launch during the company's conference call. The RX 480 garnered positive reviews, and for a brief period, rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) won't have a competitor at the price point AMD is targeting.
But the announcement of NVIDIA's GTX 1060, a $249 card that promises to best the RX 480 in terms of both performance and efficiency, could pose a problem for AMD. The competing card is set to launch on July 19, cutting short the period during which the RX 480 faces no current-generation competition. NVIDIA shipped about 77% of discrete graphics cards during the first quarter, and the GTX 1060 will act as a major obstacle to AMD's plan to win back market share.
The PC version of AMD's Zen CPU is still expected to launch toward the end of this year, although the chips are unlikely to have much of an effect on AMD's results until 2017. Polaris and Zen are the linchpins of AMD's turnaround, and the company will need both to be successful in order to pull itself out of the red.
Shares of AMD have soared so far this year on the hope that the company's turnaround is finally taking shape. The stock is up nearly 90% year to date, a sign that confidence in the company has vastly increased. The second half of 2016 will be the real test of whether AMD's strategy will ultimately pay off. If Polaris or Zen fall short of expectations, AMD investors could be in for a rough ride.

This contest isn't even close. Image source: Getty Images.
Let me cut to the chase. These two stocks have almost nothing in common.
NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is a solid business with a bright future. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a risky turnaround bet with a lot to prove. Apart from working in the same semiconductor industry, AMD and NXP couldn't be more different if they tried.
That's the view from 30,000 feet. Here's a more detailed version of the same argument.

Breaking down the financial data above, you'll find that NXP is firmly profitable and modestly priced. The stock trades at 2.4 times NXP's book value, which is on the lower end of price-to-book valuations among chip stocks with similar business models.
AMD, on the other hand, shows negative earnings and is burning cash. Sales have fallen 18% over the last four quarterly reports, and the company carries a negative book value. In other words, AMD's financial papers suggest that, if the company were to liquidate its assets, pay off its debts, and return the remainder to shareholders, investors would end up owing money to the debt holders.
Yet, AMD shares have nearly tripled over the last 52 weeks, while NXP shares lost 13%. The long-term picture works out the other way around, with NXP creating shareholder value, and AMD destroying it.
To AMD's credit, the company recently introduced a long-awaited graphics processor platform. The so-called Polaris architecture is locking horns with the equally fresh Pascal technology from arch-rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). That's a refreshing change from recent years, where AMD has been lagging far behind NVIDIA's graphics products in terms of both performance and bang for your buck.
But AMD is priced for perfection, and the company has a long history of making product promises it can't keep. Investors can only hope that AMD's Polaris and the upcoming Zen processors will make the company relevant again. That's a big leap of faith, not a calculated risk. And if the company fails to deliver, share prices would tumble down again. There's not much substance to this business.
The Dutch chipmaker is also betting the farm on a new market, but from a much stronger position than AMD. After merging with sector rival Freescale Semiconductor, the company has become the name to beat in automotive computing. That was a thriving sector when it was just based on a proliferation of semiconductors in modern infotainment and engine control systems. Now, the industry is taking its first trembling steps into self-driving cars.
It seems obvious that true autopilot systems for cars eventually will become commonplace. When that happens, you'll see a radical spike in car-mounted processing muscle. And NXP has built the perfect beast to capture this hockey-stick moment in time.
On top of all that, NXP's broad portfolio of data security and communications solutions would keep the company afloat in case the automotive computing boom rolls off the rails somehow. AMD doesn't have the luxury of a solid Plan B, and absolutely needs its handful of significant innovations to succeed. There is no safety net there.
So there you have it. NXP is already successful, and ready to launch into an even higher orbit as an automotive computing leader. In the opposite corner, AMD investors are betting that the company will ignite a turnaround rocket ride for the ages with the Zen and Polaris chips.
I would much rather invest in NXP's combination of promise and stability than in AMD's unproven hopes and dreams. How about you?

            ","When it comes to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), all eyes are on the company's efforts to reassert itself in the CPU and GPU markets. Ryzen, AMD's new line of PC CPUs, has already debuted, and Naples, the company's upcoming server chip, will arrive in the second quarter. Also coming soon is Vega, AMD's latest effort to wrest the high-end GPU market away from NVIDIA.
These new products are the reason AMD stock has exploded over the past year, up more than 400%. But AMD's most important business right now, and what has kept it afloat over the past few years as it plotted its comeback, is the semi-custom segment. Not only has this segment produced more revenue than the core business in each of the past two years, but its profitability has also partially subsidized AMD's flailing CPU and GPU businesses.
This situation may reverse if AMD's new products pick up some market share, but at the moment the semi-custom business is where AMD makes most of its money.
Sony's PlayStation 4, AMD's first semi-custom design win. Image source: Sony.
AMD's semi-custom business was born along with Sony's PlayStation 4, which launched in 2013. The eight-core semi-custom system on chip (SoC) AMD designed for the console was its first foray into the world of designing a custom chip for a specific customer. Microsoft also turned to AMD for a similar design for the Xbox One, putting the company in a position to benefit from a strong game console cycle.
According to VGChartz, 86.4 million PS4 and Xbox One consoles have been sold worldwide since launch, with each sale bringing in some revenue for AMD. Higher-end versions of both consoles -- the PlayStation 4 Pro and the Xbox One S -- launched last year using updated versions of AMD's SoCs. This provided a midcycle boost for AMD.
The semi-custom segment, which also includes server and embedded processors, generated $2.31 billion of revenue in 2016, up from $2.19 billion in 2015. With AMD's server chip market share essentially zero prior to the launch of Naples, the semi-custom business is responsible for the vast majority of this revenue. AMD's core business, the computing and graphics segment, which includes both PC CPUs and GPUs, managed revenue of just $1.97 billion last year.
The semi-custom segment is also AMD's most profitable segment, aided by the fact that its semi-custom chips are built with technology that was already developed for the core business. Semi-custom segment operating income was $283 million in 2016, up from $215 million in 2015. Meanwhile, the computing and graphics segment posted an operating loss of $238 million in 2016, an improvement from an abysmal $502 million loss in 2015.
As the current console generation matures, a decline in revenue derived from game consoles is inevitable. AMD does have another design win up its sleeve: Microsoft's Project Scorpio game console set to launch this year. But AMD will need some major non-game console deals to fully offset the eventual decline. AMD has previously disclosed that it had secured one non-gaming semi-custom design win, but details have been scarce.
AMD's new CPU and GPU products come at the perfect time, able to offset any revenue declines in the semi-custom business. The high-end variants of Ryzen have already launched, and while reviews were mixed, it's clear that AMD is now in a much-improved competitive position. Naples and Vega still have a lot of unknowns, but even modest market share gains in the server CPU and GPU markets can produce meaningful revenue growth for AMD.
The game consoles will continue to account for a significant amount of AMD's revenue for the next few years. There's no guarantee that the next generation of game consoles includes AMD chips, though, creating a risk that a big chunk of revenue disappears at some point down the line. The recently launched Nintendo Switch is powered by a custom Tegra SoC from NVIDIA, and Sony and Microsoft will have more options the next time around than they did when the PS4 and Xbox One launched.
A year or two from now, AMD's core business will likely be the star of the show, assuming its product launches find some success. But for now, the semi-custom business is the most important part of AMD.

            ","The stock market gained ground on Thursday, but the rise in major market benchmarks was modest at best. The Dow finished up just 15 points after having been higher by as much as 100 points earlier in the session, as investors appeared to grow more cautious despite ongoing signs of economic strength domestically. Many market participants looked at the critical meeting between political leaders of the U.S. and China in Florida as an indicator of future trade relations and potential geopolitical conflict going forward.
Yet even though the market was relatively comfortable with the day's events, some stocks weren't as lucky. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Banco Santander Brasil (NYSE:BSBR) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices dropped 6% after getting a poor rating from analysts at Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street behemoth initiated coverage of the chipmaker with a sell rating, setting a price target of $11 per share, which remains more than 15% below current levels even after today's drop. Analysts argued that AMD's success is unlikely to last because of potential competitive threats from other major players in the space, and Goldman believes that the current share price assumes that AMD will be particularly effective in claiming key wins in the years to come. Anything short of that rosy scenario could hurt the stock, and investors seemed inclined to agree, based on today's trading. That said, even with the drop today, AMD stock is up by more than 400% from its worst levels over the past year, giving longtime investors plenty of gains despite the pullback.

Plug Power stock fell 5%, retreating only very slightly from the better-than-70% gains that the fuel cell specialist enjoyed in Wednesday's session. Those gains stemmed from an agreement that Plug Power made with online retail giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to use fuel-cell and hydrogen-powered equipment and technology in its fulfillment network. In particular, Plug expects to sell its GenKey charging systems to make Amazon's operations more energy-efficient and cut related costs. Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh termed the deal ""a tremendous opportunity for Plug Power to further innovate and grow while helping to support the work Amazon does to pick, pack, and ship customer orders,"" and even those investors who made a lot of money in the stock's run-up on Wednesday chose not to take too much of their profits, anticipating even bigger future gains.
Finally, shares of Banco Santander Brasil fell 6%. The Brazilian unit of the financial giant is having to endure the sale of a portion of a major shareholder's stake in the company, with Qatar Investment Authority's sale of 80 million units of the bank expected to fetch prices that were below what most of those following the stock had hoped to see. Some believe that the hesitation among buyers in the offering stems from the impressive gains that the Brazilian financial institution's shares have seen over the past year and half, which have amounted to a doubling of the stock price. Predictably, the stock has lost ground since the Qatari sovereign wealth fund announced the offering, but once it's complete, some expect Banco Santander Brasil to return to solid performance as long as the Brazilian economy remains on a recovery track.

            ","There are stocks that outperform the market, and then there are some that absolutely crush it, catching investors off guard. It gets even more interesting when stocks that didn't appear too promising end up with market-thumping returns, somewhat like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and United Rentals (NYSE:URI), as our contributors explain below. 
Tim Green (Advanced Micro Devices): I suggested last April that shares of AMD, then trading for less than $3 per share, could soar if investor sentiment toward the stock improved. That's exactly what happened, to a surprising degree. AMD stock is now up more than 400% from the date of that article.

AMD has yet to produce results that justify all of the optimism now surrounding the stock. Its mainstream Polaris graphics cards were launched last year, but the company still produced an adjusted net loss of $117 million. Investors are betting that AMD's 2017 product launches, which include Ryzen PC CPUs, Naples server CPUs, and Vega high-end GPUs, will finally return it to the black. They very well may, but with a market capitalization of nearly $14 billion and sales of just $4.3 billion, anything short of significant market share gains will prove disappointing.
The company has only launched the highest-end Ryzen CPUs so far this year, with lower-end versions, Naples, and Vega still to come. Whether AMD remains a winning stock in 2017 depends on how these products fare. The high-end Ryzen 7 series received mixed reviews, praised for its multicore performance but criticized for its gaming performance. If all of AMD's launches this year are mixed bags, the euphoria surrounding the stock could fade away.
Neha Chamaria (United Rentals): Who'd think a company that's into a business as boring as renting equipment out to the construction industry could see its stock double in one year? That's the story of United Rentals, one of the top three S&P 500 performers in the past year. As of this writing, United Rentals is up a staggering 113% in one year.
You can credit the presidential elections as the event that triggered the huge run-up in the rental company's stock. Or more specifically, President Donald Trump's campaign promises of rebuilding America's infrastructure, which, if acted on, should mean brisk business for United Rentals.
The fact that United Rentals crushed analysts' estimates of adjusted profits per share and credited ""broad-based demand"" for it when it reported its fourth-quarter numbers in January further fueled investors' optimism. CEO Michael Kneeland even went on to say that 2017 should be ""a year of notable growth"" for several reasons, including its acquisition of NES Rentals, improving consumer sentiment, and the ongoing strength in key leading indicators for the industry. At the same time, Kneeland didn't hesitate saying ""it's too early to call"" when referring to the optimism around a possible government infrastructure stimulus package.
So in a way, United Rentals' crazy run-up is surprising. The stock is highly susceptible to macro factors, and no one really knows how policies under Trump's administration will pan out. The company's net profits have hardly budged in the past couple of years, though it generated strong free cash flows last year. I wouldn't call United Rentals too pricey at 19 times trailing earnings, especially given its forward P/E estimate of only 14. United Rentals may not grow gangbusters, but it is clearly already on the growth track. That should keep the stock moving higher, just maybe not as much as in the past year.
Jordan Wathen (Facebook): When Facebook went public, I thought the only path to growth was squeezing more revenue from every user. The only way to do it, as far as I saw it, was to push more ads into every bit of content, killing the user experience. In short, I thought it would be impossible for Facebook to grow into its valuation -- there just weren't many levers left to pull.
I couldn't have been more wrong. Facebook's advertising revenue per user grew from $9.51 per user in the U.S. and Canada in the full year of 2011 to $19.28 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016. All in all, Facebook is generating about six times more revenue from its average U.S. and Canada user last year than it did prior to its IPO. The majority of the incremental revenue flows straight to the bottom line, resulting in rapidly growing profits.
Realistically, I missed a few things when I looked at Facebook. I missed how important mobile would be to getting its users more engaged, generating more ad impressions, and protecting Facebook from ad-blocker losses. I also missed just how much more room Facebook had to grow in terms of users, both acquired (Instagram and WhatsApp) and from organic growth. I comfort myself knowing that I only missed out on five-year returns of about 270% at the worst and more than 600% in the best case.

            ","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...
Shares of semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are in free fall this morning, knocked for a loop by a giant sell rating from Wall Street's Goldman Sachs. After closing at $14.17 on Wednesday, the stock fell as far as $12.83 in early Thursday trading -- so the ""good"" news here is that it's now down only 7%.
Here are three things you need to know about why.
Goldman Sachs' sell rating shocked AMD investors this morning. Image source: Getty Images.
Completely out of the blue, Goldman Sachs initiated AMD stock with a sell rating and an $11-per-share price target this morning. If the analyst is right about that, it means AMD investors stand to lose 22% in market capitalization on their AMD shares over the course of the next year.
Already, the stock is down 7% in response to Goldman's rating, suggesting worried investors are taking the analyst's warning to heart -- and don't want to stick around for more losses. But are those fears justified? Isn't Goldman's sell rating just one opinion in a sea of opinions about AMD?
At its heart, Goldman Sachs' sell rating is a valuation argument. Investors are betting on a big improvement in AMD's business as consumers warm to its line of Ryzen microprocessors, and they like its growing prospects in PC gaming, artificial intelligence, and computer deep learning. Many analysts who follow the stock believe that AMD will enjoy rapidly rising revenue (and profits) over the coming years.
On average, analysts quoted on S&P Global Market Intelligence are calling for AMD's revenue to grow nearly 50% over the next four years -- and for operating profits to grow 16-fold. But as explained in a write-up on TheFly.com this morning, Goldman believes the potential improvement in fundamentals has already been priced into the shares. As a result, while some appreciation in stock price may have been justified, now that the stock is up nearly five times in two years, the current risk-return profile is unfavorable.
Priced today at nearly 44 times next year's profits (i.e., profits AMD is not even guaranteed to earn), Goldman sees AMD's current stock price as ""difficult to justify.""
Most analysts on Wall Street expect to see AMD turn profitable as soon as next year (earning a GAAP $0.11 per share, and $0.25 pro forma). Goldman, however, warns that that's a ""very bullish"" view -- and likely not to be correct given pricing pressure from even larger semiconductor powerhouses Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Goldman's best guess? NVIDIA will earn only $0.14 per share pro forma next year, which implies an actual, GAAP profit of zero dollars, zero cents.
And Goldman Sachs' argument makes sense. As the analyst explains it, there's certainly a possibility that AMD will succeed in winning market share this year with its powerful Ryzen chips. But even if it does succeed, then Intel and NVIDIA would probably try to lead customers back to the fold by offering price concessions on their own chips.
The result would be short-term revenue gains for AMD, followed by margin compression on that revenue later in 2017 and heading into 2018 as the company is forced to cut its own prices to fend off competition from Intel and NVIDIA. So what would that portend for AMD investors?
According to S&P Global data, AMD hasn't succeeded in posting a full-year profit since 2011, a year in which its operating profit margin surpassed 7%. Currently, that margin is coming in just shy of negative 9%. So while it's possible it will improve for a quarter or two, the end result of the moves AMD's rivals would make to counteract its gains in market share would likely plunge AMD's profit margin right back into a bath of red ink -- and deny the company the ability to report a profit in 2018.
Investors betting on a return to GAAP profitability at AMD may have to wait a bit longer to see it.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trying to take the game to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in server chips with its Naples platform. However, this is easier said than done as Intel owns the server-chip market hands down with a market share of over 90%. In fact, its dominance in this market is so absolute that the chip giant's products accounted for 99.3% of server chip shipments in the third quarter of 2016.
AMD, therefore, needed to come up with a game-changing product before even thinking of shaking Intel's vice-like grip over this market. But it believes that its Naples high-performance server processor is capable enough to unsettle the market leader.
AMD previewed its Naples server processor in the first week of March. It showed a product packed with high-end specs to gain a performance advantage over Intel. The company claims that the Naples architecture has 45% more cores and 122% more bandwidth memory than its competitor.
Image source: AMD. 
This competitor is none other than Intel, and AMD made that clear by demonstrating the capabilities of its platform against Intel's fastest server offering, a 2-socket Xeon chip, in a number of scenarios involving seismic analysis that's used to locate natural-resource deposits. Not surprisingly, AMD Naples was the faster chip in all the scenarios.
As it turns out, AMD Naples can process a workload two times faster than the Intel Xeon when both are running the same number of cores and identical memory bandwidth. The performance gain jumps to 2.5 times when Naples runs more cores and a higher memory bandwidth.
AMD's strategy of bringing a more powerful chip indicates that it could do better on the performance front, though we would have to wait for the actual results as Naples will be launched in the second quarter. This is why investors should take the faster benchmark performance with a grain of salt until and unless independent tests establish Naples' supremacy over Intel's product.
AMD has a pretty solid reason for going against Intel to tap the server-chip market with a solution that has superior specs. The global market for data-center servers could grow at an annual pace of 4.89% until 2021, according to Technavio's Data Center Server Market report. This should create a stronger demand for server chips as they play a mission-critical role of enabling fast data transfer over the network in data centers.
Now, an explosion of data will drive data-center workloads higher. The Cisco Global Cloud Index projects that traffic related to cloud data centers will jump a whopping 262% in 2020 from 2015 levels, with 92% of the workload being processed in the cloud. This is where AMD's Naples will come into play, as it seems capable of handling more workload due to higher specifications if the benchmarks are taken at face value.
What's more, modular data centers can also use AMD's server chips to tackle the growing workload as they provide incremental capacity to the existing infrastructure, apart from being used in remote areas. This could be a big deal for AMD as Markets and Markets expects the modular data-center infrastructure market to grow threefold by the end of the decade.
AMD, however, is not going to have a free run given Intel's near-monopoly in this space, as the latter won't wait for its rivals to eat into its market share. Additionally, Intel's response to AMD's potential threat is yet to come, which could make the game interesting if the company comes out with a more powerful offering.
But Intel needs to be on its toes because the high-performance Naples platform could help AMD carve out a small piece of the server-chip market for itself as it solves the problem of greater workloads in data centers.

            ","If it weren't already obvious that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is moving deeper into the data center, now we have it in black and white. The rickety PC market is not a strategic focus anymore, but heavy-duty number crunching is.
The strategic shift was stated in plain English this week, baked into an announcement that longtime vice president Aicha Evans will be shouldering the newly created title of Intel's chief strategy officer.
Image source: Intel.
From the announcement, with the key portion highlighted in italics:
""She will be responsible for driving Intel's long-term strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, as well as leading rapid decision making and companywide execution of the strategy.""
Intel's chief strategy officer, Aicha Evans. Image source: Intel.
There you have it. Evans is tasked with moving Intel away from the floundering PC market and into the vibrant data analysis sector. The shift is companywide and needs to be done quickly.
The plainspoken statement comes just weeks after Intel started launching its $15.3 billion acquisition of automotive computing specialist Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). In August of 2016, the company picked up data processing specialist Nervana, which designs hyper-specialized chips for artificial intelligence, data analysis, and deep-learning systems. Those are just two of the most high-profile moves Intel has made toward the data center market lately. The full list is much longer.
Intel rivals NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are exploring the same strategic direction from their own unique angles, unlocking a ton of shareholder value in the process. NVIDIA shares have tripled over the last year as the company's latest generation of graphics processors was embraced by big-iron system builders and moved into the data center. AMD's equally fresh graphics platform is taking the same tack, yielding a nearly 400% shareholder return in 52 weeks.
The data center is at the heart of Intel's traditional hunting grounds, and the company won't stand for smaller rivals stepping in to steal all of the thunder. The Nervana buyout is a direct attack on NVIDIA and AMD, and Aicha Evans will make sure to drive that point home.
We Intel shareholders can't expect the stock to double or triple overnight, of course. It's an industry giant, poised to strike at much smaller challengers. It takes more work to move Intel's larger business needle.
But the writing is on the wall: Intel is going there with a focused purpose and high speed.
AMD and NVIDIA must have seen this coming from miles away, but their investors should still be shaking in their boots.

            ","Many semiconductor stocks surged in 2016, thanks to rising demand for chips across multiple industries. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks many of the top names in the sector, rallied almost 50% over the past 12 months. 
But despite that robust performance, some semiconductor stocks could rise even further this year. Let's take a look at three chip plays that still have room to run: Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).
Image source: Getty Images.
Xilinx is the largest maker of FPGA (field programmable gate array) chips in the world. These chips can be reprogrammed after being installed, making them well suited for a wide variety of machines -- including servers, connected cars, smart appliances, and airplanes. FPGAs are usually paired with traditional CPUs to handle industry-specific tasks. That's why Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) acquired Xilinx's only meaningful rival, Altera, in late 2015.
That acquisition made Xilinx -- which launched 16nm chips a year before Intel caught up with 14nm ones -- a rumored takeover target for larger chipmakers like Qualcomm. The Altera acquisition also convinced Intel's chipmaking rivals, like Qualcomm and IBM, to pair their CPUs with Xilinx's FPGAs to match Intel's new programmable capabilities.
Wall Street expects Xilinx's revenue and earnings to respectively grow 6% and 11% this year. It pays a forward dividend yield of 2.3%, and it's raised that payout annually for six straight years. Xilinx's P/E of 25 is a bit higher than its industry average of 22, but its growing network of partnerships and attractiveness as a takeover target shouldn't be ignored.
Micron is often more volatile than other semiconductor stocks because demand for its DRAM and NAND memory chips is cyclical. Demand for those chips was sluggish throughout most of 2016, due to a slowdown in PC sales, the commoditization of the mobile device market, and a glut of memory chips crushing market prices. 
Image source: Micron.
However, those trends reversed in late 2016, as many device makers reported shortages of memory chips and rising prices. That's why Micron posted double-digit sales growth over the past two quarters, which ended six straight quarters of annual declines. Analysts expect Micron's revenue to rise 57% this year and for its non-GAAP earnings to surge from $0.06 to $2.42. 
Micron rallied more than 170% over the past 12 months, but it trades at just six times forward earnings -- indicating that the market remains pretty bearish on its chances (I'd argue that it's overly bearish). However, investors should beware of two major headwinds. First, competition from larger players like Samsung and Western Digital's SanDisk could still put pressure on Micron's margins. Second, Micron warned that Chinese chipmakers could flood the memory market with cheap chips in the near future, which could push Micron into a downward cycle again.
AMD's upside potential might seem limited after rising nearly 400% over the past 12 months. Yet investors shouldn't ignore the chipmaker's compelling comeback story. After years of being squeezed in x86 CPUs by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and high-end GPUs by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD carved out a growing niche in EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) chipsets for gaming consoles and other devices.
Image source: AMD.
That move enabled AMD to post three straight quarters of positive year-over-year sales growth -- which broke a two-year streak of top-line declines. Analysts expect AMD's revenue to rise 11% this year and for it to achieve non-GAAP profitability again following multiple years of net losses. 
As for AMD's valuation, its EV/sales ratio of 3.1 remains comparable to Intel's ratio of three and much lower than NVIDIA's ratio of 8.6.
Besides gaming consoles, AMD plans to turn up the heat on NVIDIA with more low-end VR-ready GPUs and its next-gen Vega GPUs. It also plans to strike back at Intel with its new Ryzen chips, which offer comparable performance as Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake chips at lower price points. Those efforts could lift AMD to new highs, but the stock could also plunge if demand for these chips falls short of expectations.
Xilinx, Micron, and AMD could all climb higher this year, but each of these companies face clear risks -- Xilinx faces upcoming FPGA battles with Intel, Micron faces challenges from bigger chipmakers, and AMD must land some meaningful blows against Intel and NVIDIA to maintain is momentum. Therefore, investors should carefully weigh these pros and cons before buying any of these semiconductor stocks.

            ","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has enjoyed a near-monopoly in the server chip market in recent years, with a market share of roughly 99%. Its x86 chips are the standard, and without any real competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), the only other x86 chip maker, Intel has been free to enjoy its dominance.
Operating margin in Intel's data center segment has routinely topped 50%, and the growth of cloud computing has driven both revenue and profits higher. During 2016, the data center segment generated $17.2 billion of revenue and a whopping $7.5 billion of operating income.
Image source: Intel.
The company is now warning that data center growth will slow and margins will contract, reflecting a return of competition to the server chip market and its plan to bring server chips to new process nodes before PC chips. Intel expects sales of its server CPUs to grow by just 6% annually through 2021, and for its data center operating margin to drop to the low- to mid- 40% range.
These lower estimates may not be pessimistic enough. Intel faces three distinct threats in the data center, all of which could eat away at its market share and its margins.
AMD's server chip business has been insignificant for quite some time. The company was once a major force, with a roughly 26% unit share of the x86 server chip market in 2006. But it has been outclassed by Intel ever since, driving its market share down near zero.
AMD will make its return to the server chip market later this year when it launches Naples, server chips built on its Zen architecture. AMD has already launched Ryzen, the PC version of Zen, and while reviews have been mixed, AMD has significantly closed its performance gap with Intel. AMD still can't compete when it comes to single-threaded performance, but Ryzen's copious cores and competitive pricing make the chips a clear winner for certain workloads.
Naples will come with up to 32 cores, and AMD is touting memory bandwidth and input/output capacity as the key selling points. Compared to a comparable Intel Xeon chip, AMD claims that Naples will have 45% more cores, 60% more I/O capacity, and 122% more memory bandwidth. If Ryzen is any indication, Naples will certainly be superior for some workloads, but it's unlikely to best Intel in general.
Still, Naples should make AMD a player in the server chip market once again, forcing Intel to compete for the first time in years. Exactly how much market share AMD will be able to win is anyone's guess, but it's all downside for Intel.
Beyond AMD and x86 chips, there are two other threats to Intel's server chip monopoly. ARM chips are finally making their way to the data center, with Microsoft recently announcing that its Project Olympus server design now supports both x86 and ARM chips. The company is already testing ARM chips from Qualcomm and Cavium for search, storage, and machine learning, and it has created a version of Windows Server for ARM processors.
Microsoft isn't the only cloud computing company looking to lower its dependence on Intel. Alphabet's Google announced last year that it was developing an open server architecture that supports the upcoming POWER9 processor from IBM. Google's toolchain fully supported POWER at the time of the announcement, allowing the company to use POWER processors in conjunction with chips from Intel.
The push from the major cloud infrastructure providers to support different architectures isn't surprising. Shifting from a world where Intel is the only option to a world where there are a multitude of options will surely bring server chip prices down, allowing cloud computing to get cheaper and further eat into the traditional server market.
The glory days of Intel's server chip empire are coming to an end. The data center segment will continue to throw off plenty of cash for Intel, but market share and margins are going to take a hit. It's impossible to predict exactly how much share Intel will lose, or how far its margins will fall. But it's safe to say that Intel's server chip monopoly isn't long for this world.

            ","After a strong showing late last week as the Federal Reserve opted to increase interest rates, the stock market was mostly flat on Monday, with major indexes fluctuating between positive and negative territory. But amid a flurry of encouraging analyst notes, there were a few individual companies that managed to buck the trend, and shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among those stocks that delivered outsized gains today. Let's take a closer look at what drove these unusual moves.
Shares of AMD climbed more than 7% as two optimistic analysts chimed in regarding the prospects of the company's new Ryzen 7 chips. First, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated his buy rating on AMD stock, but also increased his per-share price target to $16 from $13. To justify his bullishness, Lipacis noted AMD's Ryzen 7 (which was launched on March 2, 2017) and Ryzen 5 (which will be available on April 11, 2017) processors should help the company take significant market share considering they offer comparable performance and more attractive pricing than similar chips from Intel. Lipacis further cited the potential for further share gains and revenue growth to come from the launch of AMD's more affordable Ryzen 3 processors later this year, noting they believe the company is still ""in the early innings of its multi-year turnaround story.""
And AMD received more love in a separate note today from Susquehenna's Christopher Rolland, who maintained his own neutral rating on the stock but similarly increased his per-share price target to $12 from $9. Rolland outlined his belief that AMD is likely to exceed Wall Street's consensus revenue expectations in the coming quarter thanks to the Ryzen line's ongoing rollout, especially as sales to larger PC original equipment manufacturers like HP and Dell should commence as early as next month.

Meanwhile, after falling 27% over the past two weeks, shares of Snapchat parent Snap Inc. climbed as much as 4.7% -- but settled to gains of 2% at market close -- after the stock received its first buy rating, courtesy of Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak. 
More specifically, Cakmak initiated coverage on Snap stock with a buy rating and price target of $25 per share, a healthy premium over Snap's current price just shy of $20 per share. But while Cakmak believes Snap should continue to outgrow its competition, he appeared to temper his enthusiasm by stating, ""We recognize we are potentially giving too much credit for unproven skills in building a business, rather than just a product, but we see more to Snap than many suggest.""
With Snap shares having given up much of their initial gains following the company's IPO earlier this month, it's not terribly surprising to see Wall Street taking notice.
Finally, shares of NVIDIA jumped more than 3% on the day as Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated the graphics chip specialist's status on his firm's ""Conviction Buy"" list with a $130-per-share price target. Tari technically didn't boost his already positive opinion of NVIDIA, but he did express admiration for the importance of NVIDIA's off-the-shelf machine learning models and customer support after attending NVIDIA's Deep Learning Connect event in London last week.
Moreover, Hari believes NVIDIA's planned strategic investments in the automotive, data center, and enterprise markets should be able to drive results similar to its successful core gaming segment. So even with shares having more than tripled over the past year, the analyst believes NVIDIA shares should have plenty more room to run.

            ","The first batch of Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) Ryzen PC CPUs launched on March 2 to mixed reviews. The Ryzen 7 series, all high-end chips aimed at competing with Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) best, offers impressive performance in applications capable of utilizing all eight cores. For the price, especially considering that Intel's 6-10 core Broadwell-E chips are extremely expensive, Ryzen 7 looks like a great choice for workstation and professional applications.
But Ryzen 7 fell short in applications where single-threaded performance mattered. While AMD's new chips offer a massive leap in performance over the previous generation, they're still no match for Intel in situations where more cores provide little to no benefit. Gaming is the most prominent example, with third-party reviews putting Intel's cheaper four-core i7-7700k ahead of even the most expensive Ryzen chip in nearly every gaming benchmark.
AMD will have another shot to impress gamers in April. The company plans to launch four mainstream Ryzen 5 CPUs on April 11, priced to compete with Intel's own mainstream offerings. While Ryzen 7 was meant to turn heads with its impressive multicore performance, Ryzen 5 may end up being more disruptive.
Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
AMD's Ryzen 5 chips will be priced between $169 and $249, comprised of two hex-core and two quad-core options. The $249 hex-core 1600X, essentially a Ryzen 7 1800X with two cores disabled, will be the most expensive, roughly the same price as Intel's i5-7600K. The $219 1600 will also feature six cores, but a lower clock speed will slow it down. The $189 1500X and $169 1400 will both come with four cores, going after Intel's lower-end offerings.
Independent third-party reviews are still weeks away, but it's safe to say that Ryzen 5 will wipe the floor with comparably priced Intel chips in scenarios that benefit from more cores. AMD claims that the 1600X beats Intel's 7600K by 69% in a cherrypicked multicore benchmark, not a surprise given that it has 50% more cores and triple the threads.
Single-threaded performance will still be an issue, just as it was with Ryzen 7. But the 1600X could end up far more attractive for PC gamers due to the lower price. While multithreaded performance will be worse than its high-end eight-core siblings, gaming performance shouldn't be too far off from the 1800X in many games. The gaming performance that the 1800X delivers isn't worth its $499 price tag. But a $249 price tag is a different story.
We'll have to wait and see how these new chips perform against Intel's products. If the 1600X provides similar gaming performance as the highest-end Ryzen chip, it will certainly shake up the mainstream PC CPU market. It will be no match in terms of raw single-threaded performance for Intel's more expensive i7-7700K, but the price-to-performance ratio could make the 1600X a popular chip.
AMD will further fill out its CPU lineup during the second half of the year with its Ryzen 3 line of low-end products. With prices topping out below $169 and likely featuring only quad-core chips, perhaps even dual-core chips, Ryzen 3 will be aimed at Intel's budget offerings.
Ryzen so far has been a mixed bag. There's no question that AMD has accomplished a lot, greatly improving performance over its previous line of chips. AMD claims that Ryzen achieves 52% higher instructions-per-clock, a measure of single-threaded performance, an impressive feat. But that gain also reflects how abysmal single-threaded performance has been on AMD chips in recent years.
Intel likely won't sit still if AMD begins to win considerable market share, so there's no guarantee that Ryzen will lead to the kind of profits that investors are expecting. AMD stock is up about 375% over the past year, reflecting a fervent optimism that may end up being a bit too intense. Ryzen is a big step forward for AMD, but whether it will be enough to justify those gains remains to be seen.

            ","Warren Buffet famously said that the best time to sell a stock is never. While not even the Oracle of Omaha strictly adheres to that rule, investors still should have an appropriately long time horizon for the companies they put their money into. At least three to five years is a minimum; a decade is better, and decades is best.
Still, when companies make huge moves in a short period of time, it's worthwhile to see what the catalysts were that caused them to explode in value. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Chemours (NYSE:CC), and KEMET (NYSE:KEM) are three stocks that soared in value over the past year so that had you invested $3,000 in any one of them, you'd be looking at a $15,000 gain -- or better! Let's see why they made the moves they did.
Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
It was a long time coming, but Advanced Micro Devices posted its first adjusted profits in 2016. The last time the chipmaker was in the black, at least on a non-GAAP basis, was 2011, and after wandering in the wilderness for so long, it was a welcome homecoming.
The basis for the gains was its ability to carve out a niche supplying chips for the gaming industry as the PC business declined. Early on in 2016, it signed a deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment to license server chip designs for new processors for gaming consoles from Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, and it has recognized $88 million from the deal so far.
A lot of the sentiment in favor of AMD has depended on the ability of its Polaris, Vega, and Ryzen (aka Zen) architectures to gain share in the GPU and CPU markets, as well as sign more IP licensing deals with customers. By doing so, it has once again emerged as a competitive second source to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which it's planning to challenge with its new Ryzen processors and Naples server chips.  
However, the company is also reportedly willing to partner with its rival in a bid to take on NVIDIA. It will reportedly feature Intel's CPUs alongside its own GPUs in what can only be described as a case of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend.""
There's still a lot of ground for Advanced Micro Devices to make up, but that seems to bode well for further gains in its stock, which has risen from well under $3 a share in March 2016 to over $14 a stub today. The 436% gain would have turned $3,000 into more than $16,000 in just one year.
Image source: Chemours. 
Spun off from DuPont (NYSE:DD) in 2015, performance chemicals specialist Chemours was seen as set up for failure from the beginning, with lots of debt and toxic assets its former parent wanted to shield itself from. The titanium dioxide market that had bolstered the balance sheets of DuPont, Dow Chemical, Kronos Worldwide, and Huntsman, the world's four largest producers of the white pigment, also imploded.
However, though it initially lost 85% of its value in its first seven months as a separate company, Chemours has gone on to be a star performer. It did so by cutting expenses and its workforce, and by shedding or shutting non-core assets. In 2016, Chemours reduced costs by $200 million, improved operating cash flows by $412 million, and retired $385 million in long-term debt. While the TiO2 business it inherited from DuPont is still weak, the performance chemicals leader was still able to raise prices last year, showing it still possesses substantial power in the industry and allowing it to more than double its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margins to $157 million.
Shares of Chemours have gone from less than $7 each to over $33, a better than 400% gain that would have transformed $3,000 into more than $15,000. It still has some substantial risks ascribed to it, but it's a much better business than it was when it first hit the public markets.
Image source: KEMET.
The world's largest manufacturer of solid tantalum capacitors and one of the biggest makers of multilayer ceramic capacitors used across automotive, communications, and military and aerospace industries, KEMET has been on the rise since the November elections, perhaps on the promise by President Trump of increased infrastructure spending that would dwarf the stimulus spending package of his predecessor.
However, last month, KEMET's stock surged nearly 23% in one day after announcing it was acquiring NEC TOKIN, a Japanese manufacturer of tantalum capacitors, in which it had already owned a substantial stake. While the purchase brings new capabilities under KEMET's purview and enhances existing lines, there seems to be little reason for the outsized gains the deal generated.
When KEMET originally took a stake in TOKIN, regulators had no problem signing off on the deal because there were no competitive concerns raised, and it would only increase KEMET's market share incrementally. Of course, that was a few years ago, and now KEMET will own the entire company, but the playing field does appear to have been significantly altered to warrant the outsized gain.
Even so, KEMET's stock is up 440% over the past year, most of it since November, when it went from trading around $3.60 per share to today, where it stands north of $11 a share. That would mean it would have turned $3,000 into more than $16,000. Considering it had been trading sideways for much of 2016, those gains have largely occurred in about just four months' time, making its compounded growth rate really much larger.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a fantastic water cooler stock these days. The ticker sports enormous trading volumes and equally impressive amounts of investor chatter, and all for good reason: AMD shares have gained an outrageous 440% over the last 52 weeks, producing huge returns for investors.
But maybe it's time to redirect some of those AMD profits into a different stock. If you love AMD's stock and business plan, you should probably take a closer look at Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) right now.
Image source: Getty Images.
Broadcom is one of the largest semiconductor businesses in the world. Since the $37 billion merger with Avago in 2016, the company has been an undisputed leader in important sectors such as wired and wireless network tools, data storage controllers, and automotive computing.
The company is both diverse and strictly focused, picking its target markets with meticulous precision and selling off unwanted operations. For example, Broadcom sold its wireless Internet of Things (IoT) product portfolio last summer to smaller rival Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY), collecting a $550 million check while sharpening its business focus. IoT networking is a promising growth market, but could also serve as a distraction from Broadcom's core business operations -- so off to Cypress went the division.
It's a growth story in progress, with strong narratives for the top and bottom lines -- as well as shareholder returns. Broadcom was actually smaller than AMD in many ways just a few years ago, but has worked its way up:

AVGO Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
Past performance is not the same as future returns, of course. No one can guarantee that Broadcom's positive long-term trends will continue forever. On the other hand, the same dictum also applies to AMD's recent surge.
Let's be clear about this: AMD is a turnaround story, searching for traction in highly competitive markets. Recent technology updates led to strong sales in both the graphics processor and desktop/notebook markets, giving the company and its investors a welcome break from a long string of failures and disappointments.
That huge one-year price surge started from the bottom of a deep trough. Share prices had been sliced in half over the previous two years, diving 30% lower in 52 weeks. Even now, after that huge bounce, AMD's five-year returns and results pale in comparison to Broadcom's steady improvements:

AVGO data by YCharts.
Buying AMD now is a gamble. You're betting that the company's turnaround efforts will continue to pay off in the face of high-quality competition and a poor track record. Current share prices are built on hopes and dreams and flimsy financials.
Broadcom offers a large and stable financial platform, from which the company launches forays into highly targeted markets. This company is an established leader with a top-notch management team, producing annual cash flows roughly the size of AMD's total revenue.

            ","NVIDIA claims the GTX 1080 Ti is 35% faster than the TITAN X Pascal-based GPU, which is used for deep learning and artificial intelligence. It's priced at $699 -- about half the cost of the TITAN X's $1,200 price tag.
NVIDIA holds a commanding lead in the gaming GPU market. Image source: NVIDIA. 
One way NVIDIA is able to design its latest gaming GPUs to run faster than TITAN X is through advanced cooling solutions, which allows the GTX 1080 Ti, for example, to run at higher clock speeds while dissipating heat more efficiently.
The GTX 1080 Ti packs plenty of horsepower to run the latest games smoothly on 4K and 5K resolution displays. The new graphics card was also designed to power virtual reality (VR) games. It is important for NVIDIA to hold its lead in being the card of choice for gamers, because gaming is NVIDIA's largest revenue category. 
NVIDIA's gaming revenue grew 44% in fiscal 2017 to $4.06 billion, fueled by gamer adoption of new GPUs that feature the latest Pascal card design. Strong demand should continue, as the majority of PC gamers have not upgraded to a Pascal GPU yet. According to CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA has an installed GeForce user base of ""a couple of 100 million."" As to how far along in the upgrade cycle those users are, he said:
We've upgraded about two quarters of them, as in two operating quarters out of four years. It takes about three to four years to upgrade the entire installed base. And we started ramping Pascal, as you know, a few quarters ago. And our data would suggest that the upgrade cycle is going well, and we have plenty to go.
Gamers are enthusiastic to get their hands on the $700 GTX 1080 Ti; it sold out quickly on NVIDIA's website. Valve Corporation's recent Steam Hardware Survey updated for February shows gamers rapidly adopting Pascal-based GPUs such as the GTX 1070 and GTX 1060. Steam is one of the most popular PC gaming distribution platforms. Here's the percentage of Steam users who use either the GTX 1060 or GTX 1070 model for each month going back to October:
Data source: February Steam hardware survey. 
The launch of the new GTX 1080 Ti at the $699 price point allowed the company to lower the price of the GTX 1080 by $100, which should assist the upgrade cycle and could help the company hold its top market share position. 
The launch of the new GPU is significant for NVIDIA as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gets set to debut its new Vega GPU in the second quarter of 2017. The new Vega GPUs will target gaming enthusiasts as well as data centers, competing head-to-head with NVIDIA's GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti. Early reports suggest AMD's upcoming Vega GPU is 10% faster than NVIDIA's GTX 1080.
AMD has lost considerable market share to NVIDIA in the last few years, making 2017 a pivotal year in the high-end GPU market. The latest data from Jon Peddie Research shows NVIDIA holding 70.5% share of the discrete GPU market. This is way ahead of AMD's 29.5% share. With the pre-emptive announcement of the GTX 1080 Ti, NVIDIA is not resting on its laurels.
As of now, NVIDIA is the card of choice for gamers. The company has successfully won the top market share spot by outmaneuvering the competition on performance and price. Under the leadership of CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA also positioned its GPU business to benefit from applications outside of gaming like deep learning and autonomous vehicles, leaving AMD in the dust in these areas.
On the flip side, AMD has kept itself afloat by supplying GPUs for Apple's 27-inch Retina iMac and MacBook Pro computers in order to ride the tide of the iPhone maker's strength in the PC market. AMD's mobile GPU shipments have been strong of late due to the launch of the Radeon Pro 400 GPU and demand for Apple's MacBook Pro notebooks.
NVIDIA's stock is priced for perfection, so any signs of competition creeping up on the company could send the stock tumbling. Therefore, the reaction from the gaming community to AMD's second-quarter launch of its new Vega GPU will be important for investors to watch.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) stock jumped 19.9% in February, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, mainly on the company's strong fourth-quarter 2016 earnings and full-year 2016 report.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD said its revenue hit $1.11 billion for the quarter, up 15% year over year, due to strong sales of the company's GPUs. Investors were also likely pleased to see the AMD's gross margin improve to 32%, a year-over-year increase of 2 percentage points.
Adding to the excitement was AMD's full-year revenue of $4.27 billion, up 7% from 2015. Net losses for the year subsided from $419 million in 2015 to just $117 million for the full-year 2016.
AMD managed to increase sales across all of its major segments in the fourth quarter, bumping up its revenue from its computing and graphics segment by 28% and improving enterprise, embedded and semi-custom revenue by 4%, both on a year-over-year basis.
On the company's earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su said, ""As we look back on 2016, we successfully accomplished our key priorities, including growing discrete graphic share led by Polaris GPU adoption [and] regaining client compute share led by our seventh generation APUs,"" and added that the company also reduced debt and increased its cash.
Su went on to say that as the company heads into 2017 it's seeing ""strong revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities"" from its Zen-based CPUs and Vega GPUs.""
AMD's stock has been riding very high as of late -- it's up 490% over the past 12 months -- and investors are still looking for more. Whether they'll get it or not remains to be seen. AMD's management said that for the first quarter of 2017, the company expects revenue to decrease by roughly 11% sequentially, though it would be an 18% year-over-year increase at the midpoint.
But AMD's full-year outlook still remains strong. Su said on the call, ""[B]ased on our current market expectations and the strength of our upcoming products, we are confident we can grow annual revenue, expand gross margin, and deliver non-GAAP net income in 2017.""

            ","Some of the best investments can be the most popular. On the other hand, getting caught up in the herd -- while ignoring what's actually happening with the business itself -- can be a surefire way to leave yourself with a smaller investment than you started with. 
Three of our top contributors have identified three stocks that are popular with investors right now but could also be poisonous to own. This includes computer-chip designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), small-in-size (but big-in-risk) biotech Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX), and mortgage REIT giant Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NYSE:NLY). 
Our contributors explain why these stocks are worth avoiding. Image source: Getty Images.
If you've been considering one of these stocks for your portfolio, make sure you've studied them closely. They may be popular, but they might also be toxic. 
Anders Bylund (Advanced Micro Devices): AMD sure fits the bill if you're looking for a popular stock. The chip designer inspires impressive volumes of online forum discussions, and daily trading volumes are downright crazy for a moderately sized midcap stock. This would be great if AMD were a fresh-faced upstart or a solid turnaround story in the making, and investors just couldn't help to share a near-certain ticket to big gains before the rally runs out of gas.
Unfortunately, that's not what AMD is offering here.
AMD's rocket-like run could end badly for investors. Image source: Getty Images.
Share prices have risen more than fivefold over the last year. AMD is trading at price-to-sales ratios comparable to larger rival Intel, and a much richer price-to-book ratio. Again, this could make sense if AMD sported profit margins in Intel's class, or superior growth trends. But Intel remains a stoutly profitable pillar of the semiconductor industry while AMD's profit margins have been negative for years.
Yes, AMD is doing many things right for the first time since dropping former CEO Dirk Meyer like a bad habit. Current leader, Lisa Su, has righted the sinking ship to some degree and AMD is turning out competitive chips these days. One of these days, the company might even turn a profit.
But that's still more of a gamble than an investment thesis. And either way, share prices have shot up into nosebleed territory with little support from actual business results.
Priced for absolute perfection, AMD must now deliver on every bit of the promises its new Ryzen and Polaris chip architectures have been making. All it takes is one manufacturing misstep, one equally fantastic product launch from a major rival, or one mistake at the negotiating table with PC builders -- and then the gains of 2016 could evaporate in a hurry.
Cory Renauer (Novavax, Inc.): Although small-cap biotech stocks can inflate your portfolio overnight, they also have a tendency to let the air out. Sticking to companies taking multiple shots on goal is a great way to protect yourself. Unfortunately, Novavax's safety net is practically nonexistent. It isn't isn't running any clinical trials with new drug candidates other than a once-failed experimental respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.
For decades efforts to develop a vaccine to prevent RSV have come up short, and it remains a leading cause of hospitalizations for infants and older adults. The first effective vaccine could generate billions in annual revenue and send Novavax's stock soaring.
Image source: Getty Images.
Unfortunately, Novavax's RSV candidate already stumbled once. The market hammered the stock last year after the company announced miserable late-stage trial results. In a trial with thousands of older adults, it failed to reduce the rate of infection versus a placebo.
The company had already started another large trial with pregnant women to see if it will lower infection rates of newborn infants through their first year. Positive results could lift the stock, but in the meantime, the company is quickly depleting its cash reserves. It ended 2016 with $235.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, after burning through $255.5 million last year.
Raising more equity to pay the bills would dilute shareholder value in the near term. Further out, another failure in the maternal immunization could be devastating. As much as I'd love to see the company succeed, it seems letting this stock into your portfolio could prove highly toxic.
Jason Hall (Annaly Capital Management, Inc.): Annaly Capital is as well-run a company as you'll find, and its 12-month dividend yield of nearly 11% at recent stock prices makes it incredibly appealing, and popular for investors chasing income. 
However, because of the way the company makes a living, investors should think twice before making a big bet that the dividend will be dependable going forward. Annaly Capital makes money on the spread between what it pays for capital when it takes on debt and what it can collect in interest on the assets -- largely residential and commercial real estate debt it buys with the capital. And it's looking more and more as if we're moving from a decades-long period of falling interest rates, which had been great for Annaly's ability to grow earnings (and its dividend), to a cycle of flat-to-rising rates. 
Annaly could turn into a yield trap soon. Image source: Getty Images.
And where this could be a problem for Annaly and other REITs that focus on owning debt is that its cost of capital could increase more quickly than the rates it will be able to collect, narrowing the ""spread"" it gets and cutting profits. Frankly, that's a big reason its stock is yielding so much today -- the market seems to expect this will catch up to Annaly sooner or later, and the dividend will get cut. 
If that happens, many of those income-chasing investors will quickly flee the stock and send it falling, adding the injury of capital losses to the insult of a slashed dividend. So before you rush into this potential dividend opportunity, don't discount the risk that it really is too good to be true.

            ","After a long wait, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has finally launched the first batch of its Ryzen CPUs. AMD is starting at the high end, launching three Ryzen 7 products aimed at ending Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) dominance in an area where AMD has been largely absent for years. The Ryzen 7 1700, 1700X, and 1800X, priced between $329 and $499, represent a major achievement for the company.
Ryzen has exceeded my expectations, which were not particularly high due to AMD's long history of coming up short of its own promises. The company has largely delivered with Ryzen, and this moment truly represents a turning point. However, those hoping for huge market share gains may need to temper their expectations. While Ryzen is the clear winner in applications that can make full use of its eight cores, gaming is another story.
Image source: AMD.
All three Ryzen 7 processors feature eight cores, double the typical number for desktop processors. Intel does sell some desktop chips with more than four cores, but those are priced at almost comical levels given Ryzen's pricing. Intel was able to price these chips so high because it faced absolutely no competition. That ends with Ryzen.
The consensus from the independent third-party reviews of Ryzen is clear. In applications that scale well with the number of cores, AMD's new chips are a home run. Intel's expensive Broadwell-E chips also do well, but Ryzen offers far higher performance per dollar.
There are some workstation use cases where Ryzen performs badly despite the extra cores. Tom's Hardware ran a litany of tests where Intel's i7-7700k, a quad-core chip priced at $349, handily beats out the most expensive Ryzen chip. The site points out that many of the applications are specifically optimized and compiled for Intel CPUs, giving Intel a major edge. This will presumably change once developers optimize for Ryzen, but it may put a damper on demand in the meantime.
In tests where optimization isn't an issue, the 1800X blows the 7700k out of the water. For those who routinely use workstation and professional applications that scale well the core count and that aren't specifically optimized for Intel CPUs, Ryzen has disrupted the market in a big way.
While Ryzen's eight cores bring increased performance in cases where they can be fully utilized, single-threaded performance remains a problem. AMD's previous generation of chips, which began with Bulldozer in 2011, were awful compared to Intel in terms of single-threaded performance. Ryzen closes the gap significantly, but it still falls short of Intel's best.
Tom's Hardware concludes that it's hard to recommend the 1800X over Intel's cheaper quad-core chips for gaming. GamersNexus calls it a hard pass for gaming. These high-end Ryzen chips are by no means bad for gaming. But they simply can't match Intel's 7700k.
The problem is that PC games generally can't take full advantage of eight cores. Performance doesn't scale nearly as well with the core count compared to other types of applications, and that leaves Ryzen at a disadvantage. This varies game to game, and some games do a better job than others. But in general, single-threaded performance matters for gaming. And that's exactly where Ryzen falls short.
Even in CPU-intensive games like Ashes of the Singularity, Tom's Hardware has the 7700k easily beating the 1800X at both 1080p and 1440p resolutions. The benchmarks AMD provided were done at a 4K resolution, which showed a much smaller gap. But the bottleneck at 4K is the GPU, so the performance gap between Ryzen and the 7700k is less visible.
For those whose main use case is gaming, there appears to be little reason to opt for a Ryzen chip over Intel's 7700k. The equation changes if applications that benefit from more cores are thrown into the mix, but as a gaming chip Ryzen disappoints. This will work against AMD as it aims to gain market share from Intel.
Overall, Ryzen is an important accomplishment for AMD. AMD is in a vastly better position with Ryzen compared to its previous generation of chips, and market share gains are almost guaranteed. Lower-end Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 chips are coming in the second quarter and the second half, respectively, which will fill out AMD's lineup and make the company more competitive than it's been in quite some time.

            ","The PC gaming hardware market exceeded $30 billion in revenue in 2016, up nearly 22% from the previous year, according to Jon Peddie Research. This growth in gaming hardware was surprising, as the industry was not expected to cross the $30 billion threshold until 2018.
Both NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) took advantage of this opportunity by ramping up their sales. The shift of the gaming hardware market toward mid-range and high-end graphics cards, along with an increase in their average selling prices, was a key catalyst for both these companies.
Mid-range gaming systems, for example, had 35% market share last year, compared to 31% in 2015. Meanwhile, high-end systems accounted for 43% of the market, while entry-level systems dropped to 22%. NVIDIA and AMD each launched new GPUs to take advantage of the growth, but the latter's focus on the mid-range segment gave it significant headway.
AMD offered the best GPUs for gamers on a budget in 2016, as its cards delivered excellent performance. This led to an increase in its market share in discrete GPUs. The last available data from Jon Peddie Research indicates that AMD had 29.5% of the discrete GPU market at the end of 2016 with NVIDIA commanding the remainder. By comparison, NVIDIA had over 78% of the market just a year ago, but AMD clawed back substantial share during the period.
As the gaming hardware market will clock annual growth of 6% through 2019, this sets the stage for the rivalry between the two industry leaders to continue.
Following its gains in mid-range GPUs, AMD is now going after the high-end segment as well. The company will release its Polaris successor -- the Vega -- in the second quarter of 2017 in a bid to shake the dominance of NVIDIA's GTX 1080.
Image Source: AMD.
AMD is expected to pack more computing power in the Vega GPUs and to price them competitively against NVIDIA's offerings. It will also add the Instinct line of accelerators to Vega GPUs to trump NVIDIA in terms of compute power in applications beyond gaming, such as machine intelligence.
Leaked benchmarks from multiple sources indicate  that AMD's MI8 and MI25 GPU accelerators are going to help the Vega outperform NVIDIA's Titan X in machine intelligence applications. The leaks indicate that the Instinct MI25 accelerator is said to be twice as fast as the NVIDIA Pascal X in deep learning benchmarks and will go head-to-head against NVIDIA's next GPU -- the GTX 1080 Ti.
Digital Trends reported NVIDIA is likely to price the GTX 1080Ti at around $900, as compared to the GTX 1080's base price of $600 and the Titan X's $1,200. On the other hand, the top of the line AMD Vega GPU is expected to come in at $800 to $1,200, while the competing GTX 1080 Ti should fall around $700. Strategic pricing will be critical to AMD's success in the high-end GPU space.
NVIDIA will fight back with its next-generation Volta architecture. Rumors suggest that NVIDIA's Pascal successor is expected to come out toward the end of 2017 or in early 2018.
Image Source: NVIDIA.
Though the specs of these Volta cards are not yet available, the company is reportedly going to employ Taiwan Semiconductor as its manufacturing partner, using a more efficient manufacturing process. The Volta should be based on a leaner 12 nanometer node versus the AMD Vega's 14 nanometer.
Theoretically, a smaller die shrink should deliver performance gains. GlobalFoundries, for instance, estimates that its 12nm process delivers 15% performance gains and consumes 50% less power than the 16nm process. NVIDIA will want to solidly outperform the Vega with its next-generation offerings.
But until the Volta hits shelves, AMD will have the opportunity to continue grabbing market share, extending the company's strong momentum from 2016.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is giving both NVIDIA and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) a run for their money, as the latest market share numbers for graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) indicate. Jon Peddie Research shows that AMD's overall GPU market share -- including both discrete and embedded graphics -- increased to 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. That is a gain of 2.6 percentage points from the prior-year period, outpacing both its peers.
Intel, meanwhile, saw its share decline 3.6 percentage points to 68.1% as consumers appear to gravitate towards powerful discrete GPUs over integrated units. The bad news for the market leader: Intel is not losing market share only in graphics processors.
Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
Mercury Research points out that AMD also gained on Intel in the CPU market. Its x86 processor market share increased to 13.6% from 12.7% in 2015. On the other hand, Intel saw its market share fall accordingly to 86.3%.
In 2017, both Intel and AMD will duke it out with new CPU products -- will the underdog be able to gain on Intel once again?
AMD has devised a broad strategy of tapping both the high-end and budget markets for growth. While its latest and greatest Ryzen architecture has been designed to compete in the high end segment, AMD has decided to consolidate its lower-priced offerings to meet demand from users on a budget, according to Mercury Research.
As it turns out, most PC growth until 2020 will take place in emerging markets. IDC predicts that they will account for 54.3% of PC market share in 2020, compared to 51.2% last year. Currently, the GDP per capita in most emerging markets is under $10,000, including the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China), so having budget offerings is a smart move for AMD.
According to Forbes contributor Antony Leather, AMD's baseline 4-core CPU -- the Ryzen 3 1100 -- will cost $129. By comparison, Intel's entry-level Core i3-7100 Kaby Lake processor, launched this year, is selling for just under $120 at many online retailers though its specs are not quite as strong with two fewer cores.
Competing at essentially the same price point, AMD is hoping to win over budget-minded consumers, giving it a leg up in this segment of the market.
Though Intel has already launched its Kaby Lake processors, its top-of-the-line Core i7-7700K is expected to sport weaker specs than AMD's flagship Ryzen 7 1800X processor.
In response, Intel is rumored to be launching its Kaby Lake-X Core i7-7740K processor in August this year. However, it will be late to the market with something that truly competes against the flagship Ryzen, which AMD is launching this month, giving it about six months to rack up sales before Intel can respond.
Additionally, rumors on Taiwanese site BenchLife indicate that to tap the premium market, Intel might come out with a 10-core high-end processor that could sell for as much as $1,700. Details are sparse, but such a price point generally indicates that Intel would eclipse AMD's own top-of-the-line processor (expected to retail for $499).
The gaming hardware market is expected to grow 6% annually through 2019, and the majority of that growth will take place in the high-end segment where AMD will be able to enjoy a running start. 
With these impressive releases offered at competitive prices, it won't be surprising if AMD manages to steal additional market share from Intel in 2017.

            ","Unless you closely follow the stock, you probably had no idea shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are up a gaudy 620% since March 2016 in the last 12 months. That is not a typo. 


AMD data by YCharts.
The ongoing rally in AMD shares has been perhaps one of the least discussed but most impressive investing storylines in tech in the past year. In fact, AMD's share-price surge is about three times larger than the incredible run in NVIDIA stock over the last year. So what's driving this wild, newfound bullishness in AMD stock? Let's take a look.
AMD's business has enjoyed something of a turnaround in recent quarters. After seeing sales fall for seven consecutive quarters, AMD has produced positive sales growth in each of its three most recent quarters. Investors anticipate company-specific and industrywide trends will allow AMD to expand its business presence in each of its two core operating segments in the years to come.
On the gaming side of its business,   Microsoft and Sony will each refresh their respective consoles in the coming years to enable next-generation graphic capabilities like 4K video quality and virtual reality (VR) gaming. AMD is the main supplier of semi-customer system-on-a-chip (SOC) for both Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's Playstation gaming consoles; Sony and Microsoft each consistently account for more than 10% of AMD's annual sales. 

. Microsoft has already announced its latest Xbox iteration, dubbed Project Scorpio, which will arrive in time for the 2017 holiday season. Sony has yet to announce its response to Scorpio, but major console releases tend to closely follow one another. Many industry observers believe this new upgrade cycle will create a corresponding surge in new revenue for AMD that will help extend its current sales growth momentum.
In its computing and graphics unit, AMD should enjoy an opportunity to catch up with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in CPUs and NVIDIA in GPUs to a certain extent. AMD's forthcoming 14 nm Ryzen CPUs, due to launch by March, offer more powerful performance than Intel's i7 chips. Similarly, AMD's Vega chips appear to be a legitimate challenger to NVIDIA's GeForce high-end gaming GPUs. So there's certainly a fair case to be made that sales  will indeed improve at AMD in the coming year.
All of this is to say that things are generally looking up at AMD. At the same time though, a few important points cause me to question whether its rally can continue.

Though business conditions are indeed improving at AMD, it isn't as clear that this longtime ugly duckling has permanently transformed into a swan, for a few reasons.
A key piece of AMD's bull thesis is that its current 14 nm Zen server chips have closed the gap with Intel's 14 nm Broadwell server microprocessors this year, largely the result of Intel's decision to not shift its CPUs to a 10 nm die shrink, codenamed Cannonlake, until the second half of 2017. Bullish analysts see AMD catching Intel at the 14 nm level as creating a window for it to steal server market share from Intel, which indeed seems plausible. However, with Intel moving to 10 nm by the latter half of this year, AMD's parity with Intel server chips seems likely to be short-lived, making this large market-share gain difficult to sustain.
Equally important, it isn't necessarily clear whether meaningful sales growth will translate into actual profits for AMD and its investors. Though the company has gone through two separate cost-structure overhauls, in 2014 and 2015, its margin structure has continued to deteriorate. For example, its gross margins fell from 27% in 2015 to 23% in 2016, even as it saw its revenue increase 12%. This suggests AMD's business model lacks the kind of operating leverage that could allow it to quickly return to profitability if sales continue to rise.
In a nutshell, ongoing success is by no means assured at AMD. The company has done an admirable job capitalizing on its various opportunities in recent years. However, as we saw above, several structural reasons exist that may make it difficult to sustain this kind of success over the long term.

            ","Monday started the new week on a positive note, as the stock market once again recovered from early declines to post advances. The Dow Jones Industrials extended its string of record closes to 12 consecutive days in the wake of favorable comments from Warren Buffett about the valuation of the market. Moves within the Trump administration to transfer spending to the Defense Department also bolstered the overall market mood. In addition, good news from certain companies helped to sustain positive sentiment overall, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Windstream Holdings (NASDAQ:WIN), and Gogo (NASDAQ:GOGO) were among the top performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.  
Advanced Micro Devices' stock picked up 8%, reaching levels it hasn't seen in nearly a decade. Early reports of pre-order activity for AMD's new Ryzen central processing unit suggest it has been extremely strong, with some retailers having sold out of their allocations. The most powerful Ryzen 7 chip will be on sale starting this week, while slightly less powerful Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 models will get released over the course of 2017. Investors are growing increasingly confident that AMD can successfully compete against rival chipmaker Intel with Ryzen, and AMD's Polaris graphics products could also make the company more competitive against its key graphics rivals. With other chip offerings expected in 2017, investors believe that AMD CEO Lisa Su and her team of executives are making a difference and returning Advanced Micro Devices to relevance in the semiconductor industry.

Windstream Holdings' shares climbed 8% after the company announced that it had completed its merger with EarthLink. The combination should produce more than $150 million in savings every year from operating and capital expenses, because the two companies should be able to share operations and get economies of scale within the first three years after the merger. That's $25 million more in annual savings than the company originally expected, but CEO Tony Thomas said that the bigger impact will be on the two companies' customers, who ""will benefit from our expanded national fiber footprint and enhanced products and services, including [software-defined wide area networks], [unified communications as a service], network security, managed services, and cloud connectivity."" EarthLink will have three directors on Windstream's 12-person board, and the combined company anticipates plenty of benefits going forward.
Finally, shares of Gogo gained 15%. The provider of in-flight internet services reported its fourth-quarter financial results Monday morning, which included a 16% rise in revenue and a narrower net loss than in the year-earlier quarter. CEO Michael Small said that Gogo's 2Ku service offering ""demonstrates industry-leading speed, coverage, and service availability,"" and Gogo has been adding new installations quickly enough that it now expects to post positive free cash flow by 2019, a year earlier than previously expected. Even in the short term, revenue growth of 12% to 17% in 2017 and adjusted pre-tax operating earnings of $60 million to $75 million were promising. Investors hope that Gogo can keep gaining altitude despite rising competition from satellite and other providers, and for now, those hopes appear to be panning out.

            ","
In a startling turn of events, institutional broker Rosenblatt Securities announced this morning that it is recommending its clients sell Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock, and buy Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) instead.
And that's not all. Announcing a whole slew of new stock ""initiations,"" Rosenblatt urged investors this morning to buy graphics star NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), flash memory specialist Micron, and semiconductor maker Broadcom, but leave chipmaker Cavium Networks on the shelf. With so many new recommendations to choose from, we're going to limit ourselves today to just a choice handful.
Here are three things you need to know about them.
Image source: Getty Images.
After basking ""in the glory days of Moore's"" Law for years, Rosenblatt fears that the world has turned more ""data centric."" As explained in a write-up on StreetInsider.com today, Rosenblatt concedes that Intel has enjoyed a ""near 100% share"" of the market for x86 server CPUs. What the analyst worries about, though, is that the market today is tilting toward graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators, markets where Intel is less dominant.
Accordingly, when Rosenblatt initiated coverage of Intel this morning, it did so with a sell rating.
Incidentally, when you think GPUs, two names naturally spring to mind: NVIDIA and its archrival in graphics, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). It should come as no surprise, therefore, that at the same time as Rosenblatt warns against buying Intel, it's urging investors to buy AMD and NVIDIA instead.
According to the analyst, Intel's losses in x86 will be AMD's gain, as the latter enjoys the ""potential"" for ""share gain"" in ""x86 server/datacenter"" CPUs, and benefits, too, from a market that will favor makers of GPUs for ""next generation computing."" Similarly, Rosenblatt likes NVIDIA, a stock that the analyst expects to benefit from ""secular sustainability in the company's core gaming business,"" accelerated by ""[virtual reality/augmented reality] and eSports as tailwinds."" And on top of all that, Rosenblatt sees NVIDIA enjoying ""multi-billion dollar green field opportunities (AI, self-driving cars, etc.), combined with the company's unique set of scalable core IP/Software/technologies in GPGPU, deep neural network compute, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving.""
When all's said and done, Rosenblatt sees AMD stock gaining 17% as it rises to $16.50 a share over the next year, and NVIDIA surging ahead 26% in the same time frame. Needless to say, Rosenblatt recommends buying them both.
Veering away from the great Intel-AMD debate, though, Rosenblatt's most surprising call of the day is a recommendation to buy shares of Texas Instruments. Initiating with a buy rating and a 12-month price target of $90 a share, Rosenblatt is looking for 17% gain in stock price from Texas Instruments. That's about equal to the 17% expected gain from AMD stock, but less than the 26% profit Rosenblatt hopes to see from NVIDIA.
So why does Rosenblatt love TI? (And why might you?)
The answer goes beyond servers, to focus on Texas Instruments' ""dominant position in the analog industry,"" where Rosenblatt says it enjoys a ""high-teens market share"" of this $45 billion market. Furthermore, TI is making ""consistent share gains,"" enjoys a ""structural manufacturing cost advantage,"" and is producing ""sustainable FCF generation"" that makes the stock ideal for ""long term and income oriented investment.""
According to Rosenblatt, Texas Instruments is using its ""long-term structural manufacturing cost advantage [in] 300mm wafers"" to deliver ""20%- 30% FCF"" margins for shareholders. And Rosenblatt is right.
According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Texas Instruments generated positive free cash flow of $4.1 billion on $13.4 billion in revenue last year -- better than a 30% free cash flow margin, and even better than the company's net profit margin of 26.9% (on $3.6 billion in GAAP profits). What's more, ""FCF generation is all that matters at TI,"" exults Rosenblatt, and TI management aims to reward shareholders by returning literally all of its free cash (minus net debt retirement) to shareholders through a combination of payouts of its 2.6% dividend yield and stock repurchases (1.5% shares retired over the past year).
When you add those two numbers (4.1%) to analysts' projected growth rate (10%), what you get is about a 14.1% projected return to shareholders owning Texas Instruments stock -- not far short of TI's price-to-free cash flow ratio of 18.8.
Personally, I still don't think paying 18.8 times FCF for a 14% return is quite cheap enough to make TI a bargain, but apparently Rosenblatt believes it's close enough to justify a buy rating.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) recently surged after the chipmaker posted strong fourth quarter numbers, topped off with solid guidance. Revenue rose 16% annually to $1.11 billion, beating estimates by $40 million. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.01 topped expectations by a penny, and represented a major improvement from its loss of $0.10 per share in the year ago quarter. For the first quarter, AMD expects revenue to rise 18% annually -- crushing analyst estimates for 2% growth.
Image source: AMD.
Those numbers look solid, but investors looking at AMD's 460% rally over the past 12 months might be wondering if most of that good news is already priced in. Let's take a closer look at AMD's recovery, and see if it's sensible to buy AMD at its highest price in over eight years.
AMD's quarterly revenue has risen annually for three straight quarters, marking a remarkable rebound from seven straight quarters of declines. Much of that growth was fueled by the EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which produces SoCs for non-PC products like Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. 
That demand is expected to rise this year as both companies launch upgraded consoles for 4K and VR gaming. Revenue from the EESC business rose 4% annually to $506 million last quarter, but operating income fell 20% to $47 million due to higher R&D investments. In the past, the strength of the EESC business offset the relative weakness of the Computing and Graphics unit, which produces x86 CPUs and GPUs. Both product lines have traditionally struggled against Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. 
But last quarter, AMD's Computing and Graphics revenue rose 28% annually to $600 million on robust sales of its new Polaris-based RX 400 series GPUs. At the time of its launch, the $200 RX 480 was the cheapest VR-capable card on the market -- making it possible to build Rift and Vive-ready desktops for under $1,000. The unit's operating loss of $21 million was also an improvement from its loss of $99 million a year earlier.

Looking ahead, many AMD bulls believe that rising sales of PC and console-based VR headsets can simultaneously lift sales of its custom SoCs and discrete GPUs this year. They also expect AMD's next-gen CPU, Ryzen, to outperform Intel's top-tier i7 processors when they arrive in March, and that its high-end Vega GPUs will outperform NVIDIA's premium tier of Pascal-powered GeForce GPUs. If the Ryzen and Vega chips can achieve those lofty goals, AMD's Computing and Graphics unit could become the company's core growth engine again. 
AMD could also benefit from the upcoming expiration of a graphics cross-licensing deal between Intel and NVIDIA. Intel hasn't been keen on renewing that agreement, which boosts NVIDIA's revenue by $66 million per quarter, and rumors suggest that Intel could sign a comparable licensing deal with AMD instead. 
AMD also narrowed its losses, reduced its debt, and boosted its cash position in fiscal 2016. Those achievements all counter the bearish argument that AMD's losses will widen, causing it to collapse under its debt load as its cash flows dry up. Lastly, AMD stock remains fundamentally cheap after its massive rally in 2016. It trades with an EV/Sales ratio of 2.8, which is lower than Intel's ratio of 3.1 and NVIDIA's ratio of 9.4. That valuation -- along with its enterprise value of $11.6 billion -- make it a potential buyout or merger target for larger chipmakers.
Those potential catalysts all sound encouraging, but there are also reasons to avoid AMD. First, console sales could stall if consumer demand for 4K and VR games is weaker than expected. Early sales estimates for VR headsets suggest that demand for smartphone and console-based headsets is outweighing demand for PC-based ones. 
While that could boost AMD's EESC business, it could throttle demand for its VR-ready GPUs. Meanwhile, Nintendo's upcoming launch of the Switch, which is powered by an NVIDIA's Tegra X1 SoC, could also disrupt Sony and Microsoft's console sales as the original Wii did a decade ago. 
Lastly, too much of AMD's future relies on the Ryzen challenging Intel's CPUs and the Vega GPU countering NVIDIA's. While the Ryzen might beat Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors, there's no guarantee that it can topple Intel's 10nm Cannonlake processors, which will launch in late 2017. Likewise, the Vega might beat NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal GPUs, but it could be crushed by NVIDIA's next-gen Volta, which is also expected to launch this year. This means that the Ryzen and Vega could respectively become top-tier CPUs and GPUs this year, but those victories might be short lived. 
I believe that investors with a higher tolerance for risk could start partial positions in AMD at current prices. But I also believe that the chipmaker's future growth depends on it bowling a near-perfect game this year -- which could be very tough as Intel and NVIDIA launch their new competing chips.

            ","Many chipmakers posted strong numbers over the past year, thanks to rising demand for semiconductors across multiple industries. Two standout names from that sector are AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) -- which respectively rallied about 460% and 50% over the past 12 months. Let's take a closer look at both chipmakers, and see if either stock is still worth buying after those big rallies.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD is the world's second largest maker of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs. But over the past decade, Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs have greatly reduced AMD's share of both markets. To diversify away from those two markets, AMD invested heavily in Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) chips for other devices like gaming consoles. It also launched low-end ""VR ready"" GPUs to tap into the growing demand for PC-based VR games.
Cypress makes programmable semiconductors for the automotive, industrial, home automation, medical devices, and consumer electronics markets. It's been expanding aggressively over the past two years, by first merging with embedded chipmaker Spansion in a $5 billion deal in 2015, and then acquiring Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) Internet of Things (IoT) business for $550 million in 2016. Those moves made it a major player in the growing IoT market.
After falling year-over-year for seven straight quarters, AMD's revenues rose in the past three quarters, thanks to robust demand for the PS4 and Xbox One supporting its EESC business, and strong sales of its new Polaris-based GPUs bolstering the Computing and Graphics business. AMD's total revenue rose 16% annually to $1.11 billion last quarter, fueled by 4% growth in EESC revenues and 28% growth in Computing and Graphics revenues. For the current quarter, AMD expects its revenue to rise 18% annually at the midpoint -- which easily tops analysts' estimates for 2% growth.
Cypress' quarterly revenues have risen annually for nine straight quarters, but some of that growth was inflated by its aforementioned acquisitions. Cypress' revenue rose 16% annually to $530 million last quarter, thanks to the Broadcom acquisition boosting its microcontroller and connectivity division (MCD) revenues, and robust sales growth in China and Japan. For the current quarter, Cypress expects its revenues to rise 20% annually at the midpoint -- which also beats the consensus estimate of 17% growth.
AMD has enjoyed a nice lift from sales of consoles and low-end gaming GPUs over the past year, but the competition is expected to intensify this year as NVIDIA launches its next-gen Volta GPUs and Intel introduces its next-gen 10nm Cannonlake CPUs. AMD is meeting that competition head-on with its high-end Vega GPUs and Ryzen CPUs. Early data indicates that the Vega and Ryzen chips might respectively outperform NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal and Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake chips, but it's unclear how they'll fare against Volta and Cannonlake. 
Another issue with AMD is its dependence on console sales. The bulls believe that the recent PS4 and Xbox One upgrades for 4K and VR gaming can rejuvenate console sales this year, but the bears believe that those new features might not persuade consumers to buy new hardware.

Cypress is well-poised to benefit from the growing demand for connected and programmable chips in the automotive and industrial sectors. Those two high-growth markets accounted for 55% of Cypress' revenue in 2016, compared to just 30% in 2011. The Broadcom acquisition also boosted its content share per connected car by 26%, and is helping Cypress address the wired, wireless, memory, and data storage needs of the broader IoT market. But looking ahead, a key challenge for Cypress will be staying competitive against bigger rivals like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), which targets many of the same markets.
Neither AMD nor Cypress is profitable on a GAAP basis. AMD reported a GAAP loss of $497 million in fiscal 2016, but that represented an improvement from its loss of $660 million in 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, AMD's net loss narrowed from $419 million to $117 million. 
Cypress reported a GAAP loss of $686 million in fiscal 2016, which was much wider than its loss of $379 million in 2015, due to the rising costs of its inorganic growth strategy. But on a non-GAAP basis, its net income rose 142% to $170 million. Analysts currently believe that AMD can return to non-GAAP profitability this year, and expect Cypress' non-GAAP earnings to grow 41% this year.
AMD currently has an EV/Sales ratio of 2.7, which is lower than Intel's ratio of 3.1 and NVIDIA's ratio of 9.4. Cypress also has an EV/Sales ratio of 2.7, which compares favorably to Texas Instruments' ratio of 5.7. That makes both stocks fairly cheap relative to their industry peers.
I see solid reasons for buying both AMD and Cypress, but AMD's future relies too heavily on Ryzen and Vega's ability to counter Cannonlake and Volta. If those plans don't work out, AMD stock could quickly lose its footing.
Cypress has a better-diversified business, and its growth this year isn't heavily dependent on outmaneuvering bigger competitors. Cypress also pays a forward dividend yield of 3.7%, while AMD doesn't pay one at all. Therefore, the choice between the two is pretty clear -- Cypress is a much safer play than AMD at current prices.

            ","Popular stocks are expensive. An expensive stock can certainly produce market-beating returns if the underlying company performs well, but missing expectations can send the stock tumbling. Here's why Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) could devastate your portfolio.
Rich Duprey (Twitter): Shares of Twitter are up 34% over their recent lows and are 10% higher in 2017 so far, but the problems are legion with the short-form social media platform, and investors would be wise to avoid it.
Twitter user growth has largely stalled causing revenues to flag, as well. Advertisers are seemingly becoming leery about the value of the service as revenues from that avenue rose just 6% last quarter. In fact, the whole operation looks as though it's seizing up, as growth across any metric is, by and large, in the single digits -- hardly the kind of results you'd expect out of a tech company.
Image source: Getty Images.
But there are deeper problems, too, considering Twitter generates some $2.5 billion in revenues annually, which isn't all that shabby. But generating those revenues is apparently a very expensive business -- some $1.2 billion, or almost half its sales. And last quarter, the company announced that it needed to restructure its operations, which meant firing 9% of its workforce.
Of course, there are also the usual complaints about the online bullying that occurs on the social media platform, in addition to the rabid flash-mob attacks that can instantly appear if you fall on the wrong side of the issue. And Twitter is having a growing credibility problem as more and more of its accounts are found to be operated by bots.
According to recent research, there could be a network of almost 1 million bots controlling accounts on the site. While Twitter actively tries to monitor and prevent such accounts from existing, it points to some underlying problems that may create unease with its value.
Earnings are due out very soon, so we'll get to see in which direction Twitter is headed, but there's no reason to think it's about to reverse course now, and will likely only reveal a further deceleration in its growth path.
Tim Green (Advanced Micro Devices): Shares of AMD quadrupled in 2016 as investors bought into the story that new products would return the company to its former glory. Ryzen, AMD's highly anticipated PC CPU, will be arriving in early March. Vega, a high-end GPU gunning for NVIDIA, is expected to be available sometime during the second quarter.
The rally in AMD shares has so far been based mainly on hope. The company is still losing money, and its revenue is far below peak levels. Both Ryzen and Vega have a lot of potential, and AMD's deal with Google to put its server GPUs in the cloud is a good first step in catching up with NVIDIA in that area. But now, AMD needs to deliver.
AMD's market capitalization has reached about $12.3 billion, up from less than $2 billion at the beginning of 2016. In AMD's best year in the past decade, 2011, it earned $491 million of net income. AMD stock trades for 25 times that peak number, despite the company losing money in each of the past five years.
Ryzen and Vega, both high-end products, can certainly drive AMD's margins higher. But the market is pricing in something close to the best-case scenario. Absolutely everything must go right for AMD. Anything short of that could spell disaster.
Beth McKenna (Mattel): A popular stock -- especially among income investors -- that could prove toxic to investors' portfolios is toymaker Mattel, best known for making the iconic fashion doll, Barbie. Some of its other well-known brands are Fisher-Price, Match Box, Hot Wheels, and American Girl. 
Mattel stock's long-term trajectory was solidly up through 2013. Declining Barbie sales then resulted in the stock dropping through late 2015. The company's turnaround efforts started showing signs of success beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. Coupled with Mattel's generous dividend, these signs caused many investors to dive in, pushing the stock up considerably from its trough in 2015 into 2016.
The dividend recently got juicier -- but not for a good reason -- and is now yielding 5.9%. This increase was due to the stock's nearly 18% plunge in late January after Mattel reported weak fourth-quarter 2016 earnings.

Prime rival Hasbro has been significantly outperforming Mattel on both the business and stock-performance fronts. Data by YCharts.
The fourth quarter is critical for toy retailers because it includes the holiday period. Mattel's net sales declined 8% as reported, and 6% in constant currency, while adjusted earnings per share dropped 20%. Excluding sales from Disney Princess and Frozen -- Mattel lost this lucrative doll license to Hasbro in 2016 -- gross sales were flat as reported, and up in the mid-single digits in constant currency. So Mattel has done a nice job in closing the revenue gap created by the lost Disney license.
However, two metrics were quite concerning and point to continued struggles ahead. First, Barbie sales declined 2%, as reported, and were up 1% in constant currency. Increasing Barbie sales is the cornerstone of Mattel's turnaround plan -- and these metrics suggest the turnaround has stalled. Second, the company's decent showing on the revenue front came at a price: Gross margin decreased 320 basis points, driven mainly by increased discounting, as well as currency headwinds.
As to that fat dividend, it's not infinitely sustainable. Mattel's trailing-12-month cash dividend payout ratio (dividends paid/free cash flow) has exceeded 100% throughout 2016. This means it's paying out more in dividends than it's generating in free cash flow.
One caveat to my opinion that Mattel stock could prove toxic -- the stock could get a lift if market chatter about a merger between Mattel and Hasbro comes to fruition. But investors shouldn't buy the stock of a company based solely on merger and acquisition rumors.

            ","After years of slumping market share and lackluster performance, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will re-enter the high-end CPU and GPU markets this year with Ryzen and Vega. Ryzen, the company's new CPU, aims to go toe-to-toe with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), while Vega, its new GPU, looks to chip away at NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance.
AMD reported its fourth-quarter results in January, concluding its fifth consecutive year of losses. The situation could improve dramatically this year if Ryzen and Vega drive market share gains, something the market is already pricing in. During AMD's quarterly conference call, CEO Lisa Su provided some additional details on the company's results and outlook. Here are four quotes from Su, taken from the transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.

AMD launched its Polaris line of mainstream graphics cards in mid-2016. The RX 480 came first, priced at $239 to $199 depending on the amount of memory, followed by the lower-end RX 470 and RX 460. Revenue in AMD's computing and graphics segment jumped 28% year over year during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by Polaris.
In graphics, strong sales increases across all of our product lines drove a double-digit increase in GPU processor revenue from a year ago. Desktop GPU shipments and revenue increased by double-digit percentages from a year ago based on growing OEM and channel adoption of Polaris GPU's. Polaris processor sales were particularly strong in the performance and enthusiast portions of the market, resulting in our highest channel GPU sales in more than two years.
The company's unit market share was near its bottom, around 20%, during the fourth quarter of 2015, so it's an easy comparison. Among gamers, Polaris has been nowhere near as successful as NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards. Steam's hardware and software survey puts NVIDIA's GTX 1060 at more than four times the popularity of the RX 480. So while Polaris is driving growth and gaining some momentum, it's far from a runaway success.
Software is one area where NVIDIA has built up an advantage over the past few years. On the gaming side, NVIDIA's GeForce experience gives gamers a slew of features like per-game optimization and built in live-streaming. GameWorks, NVIDIA's library of software for game developers, allows developers to implement advanced visual features optimized specifically for NVIDIA hardware.
On the compute side, the list of software ported to run on NVIDIA's GPUs is long, ranging from computational finance to molecular dynamics simulations. This advantage will be tough to overcome, but AMD is pushing on that front.
We continue to invest in software, and our approach to software is really around open source and using the ecosystem and using the community and focused on the new APIs. So in gaming, we are very focused on DX12 and Vulcan. And on the professional graphics and on the GPU server side, really using our GPUOpen. So we will continue to invest in software; no question that that is really critical for the graphics market. But we feel we are making good progress.
Ryzen is set to become available in early March for PCs, but new server processors will be coming a bit later. Naples is AMD's new server CPU based on the Zen architecture, expected to launch during the second quarter. The strategy will be to go after the broader server CPU market, not just cloud computing.
The great thing about Naples is it really is a general-purpose product, so we will play in all of those segments. I think the cloud tends to move a bit faster in terms of just, again, from design win to revenue. So we certainly are very focused in the cloud, but I'm also quite enthusiastic about our opportunities in traditional enterprise as well as some of the storage and networking spaces.
Intel currently has a near-monopoly in the server CPU market, so AMD will be facing an uphill battle to say the least. But the server CPU market is essentially all upside for the company, since it has little presence today. If AMD can claw back a little market share from Intel, it would help drive the company back to profitability.
AMD no longer manufactures its own chips, but Su is confident that the company's roadmap will be competitive.
From our standpoint, process technology, we ramped 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer really well last year and into this year. We are actually in the process of developing now in 7-nanometer and we think the 7-nanometer foundry roadmaps are available, are very competitive, and will ensure that we have a strong multigenerational roadmap.
Intel has had plenty of trouble lately, abandoning its tick-tock strategy by inserting a third 14-nanometer chip into its roadmap. Intel's 10-nanometer chips are expected to come later this year, but the manufacturing gap between Intel and AMD will narrow substantially upon the launch of Ryzen. That's certainly good news for AMD.

            ","Wall Street didn't have a celebration on Monday, with major market benchmarks easing lower on what turned out to be a fairly quiet day in the stock market. Ongoing nervousness about tension related to new U.S. government policies weighed on some investors' minds, and a drop in the oil market also contributed to declines of 19 points for the Dow Jones Industrials and roughly five points for the S&P 500. Yet some stocks enjoyed better news, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), and First Majestic Silver (NYSE:AG) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
Advanced Micro Devices climbed 11% after getting a favorable write-up in the weekly issue of Barron's over the weekend. The publication said that the chipmaker is fighting back against its main rivals in the microprocessor and graphics processing unit markets, and it therefore thinks that the company's stock could double from current levels despite already having produced impressive returns for shareholders over the past year. AMD has disappointed investors before with turnaround stories, but CEO Lisa Su is arguably in a better position to chart a successful course than some of her predecessors at the long-beleaguered semiconductor company. Given how low it went, even incremental progress could keep lifting AMD stock throughout 2017.

Cabot Oil & Gas climbed in the wake of its getting good news from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FERC approved Williams Companies' Atlantic Sunrise pipeline, which Cabot intends to use heavily in order to transport energy production from its holdings in the Marcellus shale region. Stock analysts also cited the FERC decision in upgrading the stock, but the more important issue is that the prospect for greater infrastructure for transporting oil and natural gas from the Marcellus and other underserved regions of the country could in the long run boost the prospects of not only Cabot but also similarly placed small oil and gas exploration and production companies. Moreover, if energy prices keep climbing, then demand for newly transportable energy could stay strong indefinitely.
Finally, First Majestic Silver gained 7%. Precious metals had a generally solid day, with gold rising $15 per ounce to $1,235, and silver gaining more than 1% as well. Silver prices are already up more than 10% so far in 2017, and First Majestic in particular made aggressive moves in order to accelerate future growth to take advantage of a rebound in silver over the course of the past year. By spending capital on improvements and rehabilitation projects, First Majestic hopes to grow its production from around 11 million to 12 million silver ounces currently to as much as 20 million ounces in the next three to five years. That's a tall order, but First Majestic's assets are attractive, and continued strength in the silver market would make the job even easier for the miner going forward.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped on Monday in an apparent reaction to a bullish article that appeared on Barron's over the weekend. At 2:30 p.m. EST, the stock was up about 10.5%.
The Barron's article argues that shares of AMD, which quadrupled last year, could double this year as the company launches new GPUs and CPUs that aim to challenge both NVIDIA and Intel. Ryzen, AMD's upcoming CPU, is set for an early March launch, while Vega, its high-end GPU, will be out sometime during the second quarter.
The article argues that AMD is now a more focused and streamlined company under CEO Lisa Su, one that won't repeat past mistakes. AMD was a major force in the PC CPU market in 2006, but its market share has collapsed since then following a series of missteps. Intel has been able to run away with the high end of the market as a result.
Image source: AMD.
On the GPU side, NVIDIA has spent the past few years consolidating its lead. AMD has shown some progress with Polaris, its mainstream line of graphics cards launched last year, but the real test will be the high-end Vega. But its competitor owns the high end, and it won't take kindly to AMD's attempted intrusions.
NVIDIA has found great success selling its GPUs into enterprise markets as accelerator cards, and the article argues that this presents an opportunity for AMD as well. Late last year, Alphabet's Google announced that it was installing AMD's GPUs into its cloud platform along with its competitor's, a big cloud win that AMD now needs to repeat with the other major cloud computing vendors.
The article ends in an optimistic tone: ""Supplying a brand-new market like cloud computing, where the rules are still being written, gives AMD an opportunity that lies well beyond being a second banana to Intel and Nvidia. It could even make AMD a much more strategic company with an importance all its own.""
AMD still posted a loss in 2016, and its revenue is well below peak levels. Ryzen and Vega will need to do well in order to justify the current stock price, let alone another 100% increase. In the absolute best-case scenario, where both Ryzen and Vega are smash hits and AMD makes up some serious ground in the data center, a doubling of the stock price could make sense. But that seems like a long shot to me, especially given AMD's long history of disappointing investors.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) ended 2016 on a high note. The company beat analyst estimates across the board when it reported its fourth-quarter results, driven mostly by its Polaris graphics cards. The PC CPU market also treated AMD a little better, with client processor sales improving compared to the third quarter.
AMD enters 2017 on the cusp of launching what CEO Lisa Su calls ""our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade."" Ryzen, the company's new CPU, is now confirmed to be launching in early March, while Vega, its upcoming high-end GPU, is set to launch sometime during the second quarter.
AMD is also in a far better financial position thanks to a joint venture deal and the sale of stock and convertible notes last year. The company had $1.26 billion in cash and $1.44 billion of debt at the end of 2016, compared to $785 million in cash and $2.24 billion in debt at the end of 2015. The diluted share count has jumped 17.7%, but that's a small price to pay for a sound balance sheet.
Despite beating estimates, AMD still posted a loss during the fourth quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Revenue jumped 15% year over year, but seasonally low sales of semi-custom products knocked sales down 15% compared to the third quarter. AMD managed a non-GAAP operating profit, but non-GAAP EPS still came in at a loss of $0.01. GAAP EPS was a larger loss of $0.06.
The computing and graphics segment, which includes GPUs and CPUs, produced $600 million of revenue, up 27.7% year over year and up 27.1% sequentially. AMD's Polaris graphics cards seem to be gaining some momentum, as they drove far less impressive growth during the third quarter. The segment posted an operating loss of $21 million, a major improvement over the $99 million loss reported during the fourth quarter of 2015.
The semi-custom segment grew revenue by 3.7% year over year to $506 million. Revenue sank 39% year over year, but this was expected. The third quarter features the buildup of game console inventory for the holiday season, and with the segment still dominated by game console SoCs, there's no way to avoid this seasonality. Segment operating income was $47 million, down 20% year over year despite the higher revenue.
AMD expects its first-quarter revenue to grow by 18% year over year, representing an 11% sequential decline. The company didn't provide earnings guidance for the quarter, but it did provide a more general outlook for 2017. AMD expects revenue to grow this year, with non-GAAP gross margin improving and non-GAAP net income turning positive. With both Ryzen and Vega launching soon, these goals aren't particularly optimistic.
Whether AMD's bottom line surges enough to justify the buoyant stock price is another matter. AMD's stock soared in 2016, and the company now has a market capitalization of around $10 billion. AMD will likely need to get its operating margin into the double-digits for that price to make much sense, a tall order for a company that has lost money in each of the past five years.
There's still plenty we don't know about Ryzen and Vega. Su talked about Ryzen during the conference call, but there wasn't much new information. The initial launch will be focused on the high end, competing with Intel's i7 and i5 chips, with the lineup eventually filled out with lower-end products. The breadth of the initial launch is still an unknown, as is pricing. Even less is known about Vega.
2017 looks like it will be the year that AMD returns to profitability, at least on a non-GAAP basis. The size of those profits depends on whether Ryzen and Vega live up to expectations. With Ryzen set to launch in a month or so, more details should be coming soon.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soared on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter results that bested analyst expectations. AMD's guidance called for continued revenue growth during the first quarter, and the company confirmed that its highly anticipated Ryzen CPU will be launching in early March. At 11:15 a.m. EST, the stock was up about 12%.
AMD reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.11 billion, up 15% year over year and about $40 million higher than the average analyst estimate. Revenue dropped 15% compared to the third quarter due to seasonality in the semi-custom business, which is dominated by game console SoCs.
The computing and graphics segment grew revenue by 28% year over year, to $600 million, driven by higher GPU sales. AMD launched its Polaris line of mainstream graphics cards in mid-2016. Ryzen and Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end GPU scheduled for the second quarter, should continue to drive growth in this segment in 2017.
The semi-custom segment grew revenue to $506 million, up 4% year over year. Sales slumped 39% compared to the third quarter, which is the peak period for the business each year. A $47 million segment operating profit offset a $21 million operating loss in the computing and graphics segment.
Non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) came in at a loss of $0.01, an improvement compared to a loss of $0.10 during the prior-year period and $0.01 better than analysts were expecting.
AMD expects its revenue to grow and its non-GAAP EPS to turn positive in 2017. Revenue is expected to grow by 18% year over year during the first quarter, driven by Polaris, as well as a contribution from Ryzen.
Details are still thin on both Ryzen and Vega, but more information should be revealed as we get closer to launch. If priced aggressively, both products could make a big impact on their respective markets, helping AMD win market share from Intel and NVIDIA. If AMD can avoid its habit of over promising and under delivering, 2017 could be a very good year for the company.

Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) fourth-quarter report, set to be released after the market closes on Tuesday, will be the last quarterly report prior to the launch of its highly anticipated new products. Ryzen, its upcoming high-end CPU, will launch sometime during the first quarter, and Vega, its new high-end GPU, is set for some time during the first half.
AMD is expected to grow revenue during the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period, but a steep decline compared to the third quarter is also expected. The semi-custom business, still comprised primarily of game console SoCs, peaks in the third quarter as inventory is ramped up for the holidays. AMD's mainstream Polaris graphics cards should drive some growth in the computing and graphics segment, but the company is still expected to post a non-GAAP net loss.
AMD guided for an 18% sequential decline in revenue for the fourth quarter in its third-quarter earnings report, implying revenue of roughly $1.07 billion. That's up 12% year over year, a deceleration from the 23% growth posted in the third quarter. Analysts' average estimate is in line with this guidance, with very little variation in estimates suggesting a high level of confidence.
AMD didn't provide earnings guidance, but the non-GAAP profit the company managed during the third quarter likely won't be repeated. Analysts expect a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.02 on average, an improvement from a loss of $0.10 during the fourth quarter of 2015 but a loss nonetheless.
Analysts aren't expecting much from AMD during 2017, despite two high-profile product launches. The average estimate calls for just 8.1% revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS of just $0.05 for the full year, although the ranges are wide. AMD's guidance for the first quarter should include some impact from the launch of Ryzen, so that should give investors some insight into AMD's confidence in the product. If Ryzen and Vega lead to meaningful market share gains, AMD could very well blow these estimates for 2017 out of the water.
With Ryzen potentially just a few weeks away, AMD should be announcing more information on its new line of CPUs soon. What we know so far, based on AMD's demonstrations, is that the eight-core variant of the chip is competitive with Intel products in terms of performance. AMD expects the chips to deliver greater than a 40% increase in instructions per clock, a measure of single-threaded performance, exceeding its long-held target.
We don't know much else about Ryzen. Only the eight-core version has been shown off so far, and pricing is still a mystery. Given AMD's weak position in the CPU industry, I would expect aggressive pricing from the company. Intel certainly has room to lower prices if necessary, so it will be interesting to see how disruptive Ryzen ends up. Investors should listen for any new Ryzen information during the company's earnings conference call.
The semi-custom business is still heavily dependent on the major game consoles. AMD has so far announced three semi-custom deals in addition to its original game console deals, but two of those were new versions of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The third is outside of game consoles, but AMD hasn't disclosed exactly what it is. The company had no new deals to announce after the third quarter, but CEO Lisa Su pointed to very active discussions with potential customers. Investors should expect an update on what has become an extremely important part of AMD's business.
With Ryzen and Vega still in the future, AMD's fourth-quarter report is unlikely to surprise. The company's Polaris graphics cards should drive some revenue growth in the computing and graphics segment, but a return to profitability depends on the success of its upcoming products.

            ","While the PC market as a whole has been slumping for years, the PC gaming market has only gotten stronger. Jon Peddie Research recently came out with a report pegging the size of the global PC gaming hardware market at $30 billion. This includes not only pre-built gaming PCs but also components like graphics cards and accessories like headsets and input devices.
There has been no greater beneficiary of a growing PC gaming market than graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). As rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) snagged contracts to supply chips for the major game consoles, NVIDIA's lead in the PC GPU market grew, driven by disruptive products like the GTX 900 series in late 2014. A combination of a growing PC gaming installed base and market share gains has propelled NVIDIA's gaming segment to new heights.
Image source: NVIDIA.
The growth that NVIDIA has been reporting in recent quarters has been stunning. The gaming segment, by far its largest segment, was largely responsible for driving the company's revenue higher in 2016. During the first three quarters, NVIDIA reported year-over-year gaming revenue growth of 17%, 18%, and 63%, respectively.
The major acceleration during the third quarter sent the stock soaring, and NVIDIA's fourth-quarter guidance suggests that another big increase is in the cards. The launch of NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, which have proven to be extremely popular, in mid-2016 was responsible for much of this growth. NVIDIA will also be supplying chips for Nintendo's upcoming Switch console, and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang attributed ""a fair amount"" of its gaming growth to that contract.
Revenue from Nintendo will be seasonal, likely dropping off after launch and peaking each year prior to the holiday season. That's one reason why NVIDIA's gaming segment is unlikely to keep growing consistently at a 60%-plus rate. But there's another, more basic, reason that keeping up this growth will be tough: The PC gaming hardware market just isn't growing all that fast.
Jon Peddie Research estimates that the global PC gaming hardware market will grow at a 6% compound annual rate through 2019. That's nothing to sneeze at, but NVIDIA's gaming segment is ultimately constrained by the size of the market.
There are a few ways that NVIDIA can grow faster than the market as a whole. First, that $30 billion total includes plenty of products that aren't graphics cards. Graphics card sales could certainly grow faster than the market as a whole, driving up NVIDIA's revenue at a higher rate.
Second, the graphics card market could continue to shift toward the high-end, leading revenue to grow faster than units. The high-end of the gaming hardware market is its largest segment, representing 43% of revenue. NVIDIA has been largely focused on the high-end for the past few years, driving a portion of the company's ongoing margin expansion.
There's also one thing that can hurt growth. AMD will be launching its high-end Vega GPU during the first half of 2017. This will mark the company's re-entry into the high-end portion of the market, following the failure of its Fury line of graphics cards to make a dent in 2015. It would be difficult for AMD's competitive position to get any worse, so if Vega is competitive with NVIDIA's high-end products, the growth of NVIDIA's gaming segment could suffer.
The PC gaming market is a good place to be, and NVIDIA's focus on the high end has paid dividends. The company's gaming segment can certainly continue to grow at a healthy rate, with a double-digit pace certainly possible. But expecting the 63% growth rate of the third quarter to become the new norm isn't realistic.

            ","NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) both operate in the semiconductor industry. That's about as far as their similarity goes. One is a rising star in embedded solutions and automotive computing, heading into a $47 billion merger with sector giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The other is an eternal underdog in the PC market that's working on a dramatic turnaround right now.
Which chip stock is a better fit for your portfolio? Let's find out.
The choice between AMD and NXP boils down to two simple questions:
I have often said that the Qualcomm-NXP combination looks like a lock. The two companies share very few customers and end markets, so this merger is not likely to create any sort of monopoly. Regulatory roadblocks would have to focus on the sheer scale of the buyout. Moreover, President Donald Trump is paving the way to easier megamergers by nominating anti-regulation candidates to many key government roles. So, this buyout should be a cakewalk.
Unfortunately, that high-odds risk has suddenly become more likely.
Last week, Qualcomm was served a lawsuit from major customer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), wherein the iPhone maker claims that the chipmaker has been playing extortion games with its component supply chain.
Qualcomm shares fell as much as 14% on the news, and some analysts expect the lawsuit to delay the NXP deal. Renewed scrutiny of Qualcomm's business practices could block rubber-stamp deal approvals in important territories such as China, Taiwan, and South Korea.
The Apple charge will also divert management attention and other assets from the NXP process. If nothing else, the final approval might be pushed into 2018 or beyond.
This is a real risk for the NXP merger, but I still expect the final signatures to be delivered by the end of the year. This business combination is too important to let it slide out of view. And don't forget that regulatory intervention would lead to Qualcomm sending a $1.25 billion breakup fee NXP's way.
Your mileage may vary, which is fine. But if you agree with my analysis, NXP remains a near-certain 14% return from here, and AMD needs to show a stronger hand than that.

Image source: Getty Images.
Let's cut to the chase: AMD shares could go absolutely anywhere in 2017. That's enough to keep my finger away from the buy button.
The chipmaker had a fantastic year in 2016. AMD introduced a new graphics chip architecture to rave reviews, promised an equally game-changing update to its CPU portfolio in 2017, and saw share prices quadruple. AMD's chart has cooled down a bit in January, falling back 12% as the company prepares for a fourth-quarter report next week. But that's still a lot of market momentum. Share prices could keep skyrocketing in 2017 if the company continues to deliver on its next-generation technology promises.
That's a big if, though. AMD does not have a great track record when it comes to dependable execution, and often falls far short of ambitious goals. Recently appointed CEO Lisa Su has been a breath of fresh air so far, but she is battling the fallout from nearly a decade's worth of less-successful predecessors.
If AMD's momentum runs out, the stock has a long way to fall. AMD's trailing earnings and EBITDA profits are negative, and free cash flows stand at a razor-thin $148 million. Lacking the support of traditional valuation builders, the stock chart would take a dramatic nosedive in a hurry on the slightest of errors.
AMD owners can win big or lose big here. That's a poker chip, not an investment thesis.
By contrast, NXP offers a near-guaranteed 14% return. Even if the Qualcomm deal falls apart, there's a quick $1.25 billion cash payment in it for NXP investors.
This one isn't a close call. I would take NXP over AMD in a heartbeat.

The tech sector was the market's top performer in 2016, and its deep and far-reaching impact on business and everyday life suggests it will continue to be a go-to for investors seeking tremendous growth opportunities. Technology is fast-moving and tends to be highly competitive, so companies that operate in tech -- including Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), Qualcomm, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- are constantly facing new pressures that influence future outcomes. While investing in the broader space has been historically rewarding over the past two decades, staying on top of the dynamics that are shaping the industry is essential for new and seasoned investors alike.
To provide readers with a primer on some of the most important elements shaping the financial performance of tech companies, we asked three of The Motley Fool's top writers to each spotlight one of the most important things to know about the technology sector.
Brian Feroldi: One of the most challenging aspects of investing in the tech sector is that competition tends to be fierce. That fact makes it quite difficult for companies to maintain their profit margins over the long term, which can lead to disastrous results for investors. 
A nice case study of this principle in action can be seen by comparing the long-term results of two semiconductor manufacturers -- Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Skyworks Solutions. Over the past decade, AMD has struggled to convince customers that its chips are deserving of a premium price tag, which has led to a significant decline in the company's gross profit margin. Over the same time period, Skyworks' focus on manufacturing specialty chips that are used in mobile devices has allowed it to increase its gross profit margin.

AMD's inability to maintain its profit margin has caused its stock to languish. Skyworks, on the other hand, has turned out to be a home-run investment.

The takeaway here is clear -- before you buy a tech stock, or any stock for that matter, ask yourself if the company will be able to maintain its pricing power over the long term. If the answer is no, your money is probably best invested elsewhere.
Keith Noonan: The tech industry is going through a major period of consolidation, as companies operating in the sector aim to create defensive benefits, quickly ramp up competencies in emerging categories such as the Internet of Things, and build encompassing platforms that keep customers engaged in their ecosystems. 2016 saw a huge acquisitions push across hardware, software, and services. Qualcomm's $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors was the biggest deal of the year and rapidly accelerated the company's position in connected cars. Intel also went on a purchasing spree to strengthen its competitiveness in automobile chips and services. Companies with strengths in the Internet of Things will continue to be acquisition targets going forward, and 2017 looks to be another big year for purchases related to connectivity and data analytics technologies.
Many of tech's big players are also buying up assets outside of the sector -- and entertainment companies are emerging as common acquisitions targets. With Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet dominating the advertising business and making moves toward disrupting the traditional internet service provider and wireless carrier models, some companies threatened by the commoditization of their services are responding by bolstering their positions in content. Comcast continued its push to grow its studio entertainment business by buying DreamWorks Animation in 2016, and AT&T has made an $85.4 billion bid to acquire Time Warner -- a move that comes on the heels of its $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV. The AT&T and Time Warner merger faces regulatory obstacles to closing, but the power held by Facebook and Google and the broader climate of consolidation bolster the case for approval.
Buying a company in the hopes that it will be acquired is a risky investment strategy, but there's incredible momentum in acquisitions, and it seems all-but-certain that the tech industry will continue to be shaped by the ongoing consolidation push.
Brian Stoffel: There is, perhaps, no skill set more in demand than those who know how to code, create, and design technology, especially when it comes to designing user-friendly interfaces. There's a huge chasm between the techno-nerds who know how to make stuff, and the rest of us mere mortals. Having a team of individuals who take a very complex system, and make it very simple and easy to use, is what separates the winners from the losers in the technology field.
That's why attracting -- and retaining -- top talent is so important in the technology sector. It helps explain why companies such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) can pull in $415 million in free cash flow over the past year and still post a loss of $380 million . Much of that difference is in the form of enormous equity bonus packages paid to employees.
One way I like to note how well a company is doing at keeping its talent is by going through Glassdoor.com reviews. Companies such as Facebook do extremely well, with an average rating of 4.5 stars out of 5.0. And organizations that ""get"" what motivates a workforce can make a huge difference as well.
Consider an excerpt from a 2010 filing by Alphabet subsidiary Google. In it, management said: 
[Monetary] incentives are secondary to career growth, work environment, and engaging work opportunities. We seek to develop a highly motivated and collaborative workforce that pursues achievements for the sake of progress and innovation. 
It's that type of thinking that can turn technology companies into decades-long wealth builders, and it's what investors should be looking for.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 295% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. A return to revenue growth, a series of deals that bolstered the balance sheet, the launch of its mainstream Polaris graphics cards, and optimism regarding new CPUs and GPUs set to launch in the coming months drove the stock higher.
AMD entered 2016 in rough shape. Revenue in 2015 slumped 28%, leading to a net loss of more than $400 million. Cash was dwindling, approaching the lower limit of the company's target range. On top of all that, AMD's core CPU and GPU products were largely not competitive with those of Intel or NVIDIA.
AMD took a few steps in 2016 to raise cash, giving it some much-needed breathing room that boosted investor confidence in a turnaround. A deal to create a joint venture in China around the company's x86 server technology raised $293 million in licensing fees, with the potential for royalties on sales of chips. More cash was raised later in the year when AMD sold new common stock and convertible notes, further bolstering the balance sheet.

Data by YCharts.
AMD returned to year-over-year revenue growth during the second quarter and posted even stronger growth during the third quarter. The launch of the Polaris mainstream graphics cards lifted the computing and graphics segment, while strong demand for semi-custom game console chips drove growth in the semi-custom segment. Polaris hasn't been as big of a success as NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, at least according to Steam's hardware and software survey numbers, but it did help return the company to growth.
AMD revealed some information about Ryzen, its upcoming CPU, and Vega, its upcoming high-end GPU, last year, adding fuel to the fire. The market is betting that AMD will become competitive in both the high-end CPU and GPU markets when those products launch during the first half of 2017.
There's no question that AMD is in a stronger position than it was at the end of 2015. The top line and balance sheet are looking stronger, and Ryzen and Vega have the potential to return the company to profitability.
But investors should not forget AMD's long history of over-promising and under-delivering. The Bulldozer family of CPUs launched in 2011 turned out to be a complete disaster for the company. The Fury line of high-end GPUs launched in 2015 didn't even move the needle despite AMD hyping up its use of high-bandwidth memory. And Polaris, while producing some growth for the company, has been completely overshadowed by NVIDIA's Pascal.
2017 may be different. Based on what AMD has said so far, both Ryzen and Vega have some serious potential. But if either product comes up short of expectations, the stock's impressive gains from last year could quickly vanish.

Investors love stocks that give them massive returns. The most common way to get huge gains is to invest for the long run, counting on fundamental business success to produce ample dividends and lucrative share-price appreciation. Yet sometimes, gains come in a very quick period of time, and a very small number of stocks have managed to quadruple in value in just the past year. Below, we'll look at Ariad Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ARIA), U.S. Steel (NYSE:X), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to see whether investors who are seeing the companies for the very first time will be able to squeeze out any more gains from their stocks.

ARIA data by YCharts.
Ariad Pharmaceuticals has seen the bulk of its share gains come very recently. Throughout 2016, excitement built up for Ariad's Iclusig treatment for two rare forms of leukemia. Yet although the treatment had good results for the blood and bone marrow diseases, the high price tag that Ariad charged for the drug made some investors nervous that more stringent federal regulation of drug prices could result in lower long-term profits for the company. Those fears largely abated after the presidential election, as investors see President-elect Donald Trump as being less likely to encourage regulation and allowing Ariad to earn its profits longer.
Then, just earlier this week, Ariad announced that Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda Pharmaceutical would buy out Ariad in an all-cash deal worth $5.2 billion. The $24-per-share price for the takeover sent Ariad up 73% in a single day, bringing its gains to nearly 350% since this time last year. Going forward, investors can't expect any further share-price gains from Ariad given the buyout bid, and although few expect roadblocks to the deal, there's at least some chance that a rejection of the merger could send Ariad shares back downward.
U.S. Steel's big gains have come from steady upward movement throughout the past year. Even before the presidential election, prospects for healthier economic conditions across the globe had investors getting more excited about the steel industry. Moreover, favorable rulings from the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed anti-dumping tariffs on foreign competitors, creating greater opportunities for U.S. Steel to compete more effectively against foreign competition.
The presidential election also led to a big bounce for U.S. Steel. Plans to boost infrastructure spending were bullish for the construction industry, and steel will likely play a substantial role in any infrastructure rebuilding or new construction that takes place. Exactly how far that can pull U.S. Steel's profits higher remains to be seen, but investors are excited enough to have given the stock a more than 375% return over the past 12 months in anticipation of better times ahead. Shareholders shouldn't expect another quadruple in the near future, but the stock hasn't necessarily hit its top just yet.
Finally, Advanced Micro Devices has been the winner of this group, with its stock climbing more than 435% since this time last year. Several victories have helped propel the semiconductor company higher, including a couple of deals to create joint ventures with partners in Asia. The sale of its semiconductor assembly and test assets to Nanton Fujitsu Microelectronics gave AMD about $320 million in cash to launch strategic efforts of its own, and another deal with Tianjin Haiguang earned AMD almost $300 million more for licensing its x86 server chips for the Chinese server market.
The biggest win for Advanced Micro Devices came from its Polaris graphics cards, which have helped it become an even bigger player in the graphics processing unit market. Major customers have replied by using AMD chips in their own products, eating into the commanding lead that NVIDIA has had for years. Even if Advanced Micro Devices maintains only modest market shares in key markets, the opportunities there are big enough for the stock to keep climbing sharply in 2017 and beyond.
Investors can't count on any stock they own quadrupling in such a short period of time. Although Ariad's upside is almost nonexistent, both AMD and U.S. Steel could continue to see gains if things keep going well in their respective markets.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 27.3% in the month of December, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, continuing its stellar climb on encouraging rumors and as analysts continued to express optimism for shares of the graphics chip specialist.
For perspective, AMD stock climbed more than 300% when all was said and done in 2016, including a 23% rise in November after the company announced its Radeon GPU technology will be available to Google Cloud Platform users starting in 2017.
But shares began their December rise early in the month after rumors surfaced that AMD has struck a deal with Intel to license its Radeon graphics technology. If this rumor proves true, Intel is apparently planning to integrate that technology into its future processors.
Two days later, analysts at Merrill Lynch upgraded AMD stock to ""buy"" from ""underperform,"" effectively reversing a negative call made more than two years ago and admitting they missed out on AMD's stunning turnaround. Analysts at Mizuho Securities followed suit two weeks later, citing significant opportunities for gross margin expansion given incremental revenue from deep learning application wins for AMD's ProGFx, Ryzen, and Zen chips.
I'm a firm proponent of the idea that winners keep on winning, so it's no surprise to see Wall Street analysts offering their respective votes of confidence as AMD executes its ongoing business turnaround. If AMD can indeed improve its gross margin in the coming year while identifying additional compelling growth industries to put its flagship GPU technology to work, it will be equally unsurprising to see AMD stock keep delivering market-beating returns going forward.

Some great investment returns just sneak up on you. That stock you're watching seems primed for nothing special, or maybe a downright disaster. Then the chart squiggles suddenly skyrocket, rewarding shareholders with massive returns.
And you missed it.
Here at the end of 2016, that's how I feel about longtime graphics-chip rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Their stock charts took a drastic positive turn this year, leaving me flat-footed alongside many other investors.
And you know what? I kind of wish I had added to my Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stake in early February, or perhaps the middle of the summer. But I didn't. So here I am, telling you all about those missed opportunities instead.
Let's be honest -- nobody, but nobody, had any real reason to believe that NVIDIA or AMD would soar sky-high in 2016.
Both companies were polishing up brand-new architectures for their graphics chips, and AMD was also preparing to launch a new platform for PC and server processors. That might sound promising at first glance, but both companies have a history of fumbling important technology launches.
NVIDIA and AMD shares were already on a roll, as investors were hoping for the best out of those important chip announcements. As New Year's rolled around, the stocks had gained more than 60% in just five months. That could very well have been the end of this story, setting investors up for huge corrections if anything went wrong.
But both AMD and NVIDIA reached into their top hats to produce some good-looking bunny rabbits. They proceeded to unveil the new NVIDIA Pascal and AMD Polaris chips, selling truckloads of these products in the second half of the year. AMD delivered three earnings surprises in 2016 along with strong top-line results, and NVIDIA blew every target out of the water.
I did not see any of this coming, and can only glare ruefully at their year-to-date returns. NVIDIA shares have more than tripled, showing a 235% return this year, while AMD quadrupled to the tune of 304%.
Now, AMD pushed its PC and server chip releases into 2017, but Polaris is pulling its weight with confidence in the meantime. Both Polaris and Pascal have the potential to reach brand-new markets, as their number-crunching powers happen to be very useful for supercomputing tasks such as real-time artificial intelligence and high-speed data analysis.
Will these turnarounds reach even higher highs next year? You tell me. AMD and NVIDIA must continue to execute in order to reach higher, which is hardly a guaranteed outcome if you've been following these companies for a few years. In particular, AMD cannot afford to flub its next processor launch, because graphics products account for less than one-third of AMD's overall sales. This launch will make or break the bulk of AMD's revenue stream.
So I'm staying away from both AMD and Nvidia here because I'm not terribly convinced that the smooth sailing will continue. And even if you disagree with my assessment of the investment risks involved, it would be reckless to back up the truck at this point. Momentum plays can be great while they last but they cannot last forever, you know.

Okay, so why do I feel like I stiffed myself by not buying more Netflix this year? The stock is only trading sideways year to date.
For starters, the ever-volatile stock took some dramatic dives in February and July. The first drop provided as much as a 30% discount, and the summer swoon stopped at roughly 28%. Share prices have recovered strongly from these troughs, mostly thanks to a rock-solid earnings report in October. If you bought Netflix shares on Feb. 8, you'd be enjoying a 52% return on that investment today.
That's still less impressive than AMD's or NVIDIA's soaring jumps, I know. But the thing is, it was always obvious that these Netflix discounts would be temporary. They were negative reactions to positive news, opening obvious buy-in windows. I'm feeling silly for letting these opportunities pass me by.
In February, Netflix had just achieved nearly worldwide coverage with its streaming video services. That's paving the way toward massive revenue and profit growth in the long run, but at the cost of high short-term expenses. Result: lower share prices for all the wrong, downright myopic reasons.
Then, the company reported fourth-quarter results where pretty much every business metric came in ahead of management's guidance targets. But traders focused on the small miss on domestic subscriber additions, complained about the high costs of rolling out a global service, and punished the stock some more. Again, for all the wrong reasons.
The same issues festered for months, weighing heavily on Netflix shares for no good reason. Another turn in soft subscriber additions followed in July, as consumers turned their attention to election coverage and the Rio Olympics instead of to Netflix content: obviously a short-lived issue, with a near-certain rebound coming up ahead.
More missed opportunities.
The third-quarter report in October swept away many of the cobwebs, and Netflix shares broke loose to new all-time highs. Yes, a $46 billion market cap can grow 20% larger overnight.
No more deep-discount buying windows.
Yes, I wish I had dipped just a little deeper into the Netflix well at some point in 2016. There was really no reason not to, and several blindingly obvious chances to make a move.
Netflix already accounts for about one-third of my total nest egg, so I'll console myself with the fact that I'm spreading my eggs across several baskets instead. But Netflix remains the best investment idea on the table today, and looks likely to make a big positive move in 2017 as management is shifting its focus from expansion to turning a profit.
I'm not exactly missing out on that jump, but I could have taken an even bigger position at a fantastic buy-in price.
Oh, well. Always forward.

The gaming sector has performed well in 2016, with many of the top names in the space, from Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) to chipmaker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), posting solid returns. Well-received new content, impressive new technology, and renewed ideas about how to get both of those to consumers have helped the sector grow this year. Here were some of the winners in 2016, and what the future could hold for these companies.

Of the content creators and licensors, Nintendo was the best-performing in its group in 2016, with more than a 50% rise through the year to date. Though it was up around 80% before a mid-December sell-off, the company has still had a remarkable year. Nintendo's resurgence follows the company's decision to finally develop a mobile strategy and bring its timeless characters and stories into a modern age.
Nintendo was one of the big winners with the Pokemon Go phenomenon that exploded worldwide this year, and the company announced a new game console called Switch to come out in 2017, which has helped to raise its stock price as well. Most recently, Nintendo launched a new mobile game called Super Mario Run, which topped the download charts during its first weekend, with around 5 million downloads its first day. The game has had some disappointing reviews so far, pushing Nintendo's YTD growth lower, but it's still the early days of Nintendo's new mobile game strategy, so it's certainly not game over yet.

Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) was also a top performer within the gaming content space, posting a 40% jump in share price this year. Take-Two, maker of popular games such as Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K17, has grown sales 21% in the most recent quarter, year over year. The company has also been able to adopt a more digitally focused strategy, which has helped margins so that, while earnings fell year over year, they were far above analyst estimates in the most recent quarter. 
Aside from the actual content creators, some gaming platform companies also performed well this year. Sony (NYSE:SNE) gets a spot on this list largely thanks to the launch of its PlayStation 4 gaming system and more recent launch of a premium virtual reality (VR) bundle that brings VR game play to mass-market gamers. Gaming makes up only about 20% of Sony's total revenue, but it's also its fastest-growing division and could help push the stock higher as more games for its VR headset come out in 2017.

In China, where video game sales are booming and there are an estimated 700 million mobile users and growing, local platform company NetEase (NASDAQ: NTES) has been a winner, with a 19% jump in share price this year. With an assortment of its own online games (among many online services from email to advertising), NetEase also has a deal with content companies such as Activision Blizzard to distribute its games across China, such as one of the hottest games this year, Overwatch, which has done very well in China.
While the content and the platforms for playing it on are the face of the gaming industry, the technology inside the devices -- be it gaming consoles, computers, or virtual reality headsets -- are chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA. These two companies have each made big plays so far in 2016, not just in gaming -- though that has been a growth driver for both companies, with each putting out new high-power chips for intense gaming -- but also in autonomous cars, artificial intelligence, connected devices within the Internet of things, and more. As a result of this growth, AMD and NVIDIA stocks are up 280% and 210%, respectively, year to date. 
While these content, platform, and chip companies did well this year as the gaming industry continued to grow, bricks-and-mortar video games and gaming hardware seller GameStop (NYSE: GME) had a rough year, which has pushed its stock down 8% so far in 2016. GameStop's business model has struggled to update amid a changing consumer landscape. Looking forward, this trend is likely to grow, as the gaming industry moves to a more e-commerce-focused market, and content creators continually seek a model of digital downloads. The companies with the best content and the most interesting technology are the ones to expect to lead growth in 2017.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will report a net loss this year, making 2016 the fifth consecutive year that AMD has failed to turn a profit. 2017 is shaping up to be better for AMD, with the launch of its new Ryzen CPUs and high-end Vega GPUs on the horizon. The success of those products will determine whether AMD will return to profitability next year and beyond.
AMD investors are no doubt looking forward to 2017, and the company made some good moves this year that have improved its chances of success. The balance sheet is stronger and its prospects are brighter thanks to AMD's best moves of 2016.

Image source: Advanced Micro Devices.
At the end of the first quarter of 2016, AMD's balance sheet was looking stretched. The company's cash balance was barely above $700 million, near the low end of its target range, and debt topped $2.2 billion. Book value had plunged to negative $500 million thanks to years of losses.
In April, AMD sold its semiconductor assembly and test assets into a joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, retaining a 15% stake and receiving about $320 million in cash, net of taxes and other expenses. This deal provided AMD with some much-needed cash as it was preparing to launch Polaris, its mainstream-orientated GPU.
Around the same time, AMD signed a deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. to form another JV, this one focused on bringing x86 server SoCs to the Chinese server market. AMD licensed its high-performance processor and SoC technology to the JV, receiving a $293 million licensing payment with the potential for additional royalty payments in the future.
These two deals greatly strengthened AMD's balance sheet, giving it the necessary resources to forge ahead with its turnaround plan.
Shares of AMD have soared this year, driven higher by optimism that the company's new products will drive revenue and earnings growth. The stock is up nearly 300% year to date, reflecting an extreme shift in investor sentiment.

AMD data by YCharts.
AMD took advantage of its soaring stock price in August when it announced that it was selling $600 million of new shares of its common stock, along with $700 million of 2.125% notes. The company planned to use the proceeds to knock down some of its debt, thus reducing its annual interest payments and making the path to profitability a little bit easier. AMD paid $160 million in interest payments in 2015.
AMD now has $1.26 billion of cash on its balance sheet, and it has reduced its total debt to about $1.63 billion. The company's financial situation, precarious earlier this year, is now much stronger, giving it the resources to launch its new CPUs and GPUs next year. Existing investors were diluted by the stock sale, but they should be thrilled that AMD used the opportunity to raise cash.
For those wanting to utilize graphics cards in the cloud, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has long been the only real option. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud all offer NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs exclusively. The company's focus over the past few years on deep learning and GPU compute has paid off. NVIDIA's data center business is nearing a $1 billion annual revenue run rate, with third-quarter sales nearly tripling year over year.
AMD's GPUs aren't available on any of those platforms, and it's fallen far behind NVIDIA in the market for accelerators. An analyst at Nomura estimates that NVIDIA controls 80% of the accelerator market, with AMD and Intel fighting for the scraps.

AMD made some headway in 2016. Alphabet's Google announced in November that it planned to offer AMD's FirePro GPUs through its cloud platform, along with NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs as well. While this is win for both AMD and NVIDIA, it narrows the gap a little between the two companies.
AMD built on this momentum with the announcement of Radeon Instinct in December, the company's upcoming line of graphics cards built specifically for deep learning. The company is playing catch-up in this area, but the potential opportunity to accelerate A.I. workloads is significant. NVIDIA is still the undisputed leader in the accelerator market, but AMD made some noise in 2016.

Tuesday is turning out to be a great day to be a tech investor. Earlier this morning, three big upgrades came out of Wall Street. First, Mizuho Securities upgraded AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) to buy, then Goldman Sachs followed with upgrades of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) to neutral -- and in the day's biggest move, upgraded NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock to conviction buy.
According to the analysts, AMD stock has the potential to rise 14% in value (new price target: $13). Western Digital, on the other hand, up 52% already since Goldman mistakenly put it on its sell list back in August, has probably peaked already (Goldman says it's worth only $68 a share). The strongest prospects of all, however, can be found at NVIDIA -- where Goldman believes the stock could shoot up a further 22% to a target price of $129 per share.
Here are three things you need to know.

Computer chip stocks are lighting up. Image source: Getty Images.
Let's begin with the day's biggest news. StreetInsider.com reports this morning that Goldman Sachs has added NVIDIA to its ""conviction buy list,"" citing the company's ability to benefit from ""positive secular trends in gaming, VR (virtual reality), AI (artificial intelligence)/ML (machine learning) and automotive."" According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, most analysts who follow the stock think NVIDIA will grow its earnings about 10% annually over the next five years -- but Goldman sees a whole lot more in store.
In particular, Goldman sees revenue from NVIDIA's data center business (i.e., storage) nearly doubling in fiscal 2018, and growing 53% again in fiscal 2019. (Here it's important to remember that NVIDIA operates on an accelerated financial calendar. Right now, we're in the middle of fiscal Q4 2017, so when Goldman talks about fiscal 2018, it really means next year -- 2017.) Gaming revenue, too, will be above-trend, with Goldman predicting 20% sales growth there next year, followed by 28% one year after.
Clearly, Goldman is expecting NVIDIA to grow a whole lot faster than anyone else out there, and the analyst predicts that ""estimate revisions [will] serve as a positive catalyst for the stock in the coming quarters"" as other analysts begin to realize that they were wrong, and Goldman Sachs was right. (Modesty has never been one of Goldman's defining virtues.)
That's actually kind of curious, given that at the same time as Goldman is loudly proclaiming its faith in NVIDIA stock, it's also fessing up to a pretty massive miss in its predictions for Western Digital. As Goldman admits, four months ago it told investors to sell Western Digital because the company was spending too much on capex, and building capacity to serve a NAND market that would be in critical ""oversupply"" by 2017.
Now however, Goldman says it was off base on that prediction. ""NAND prices for SSDs and retail may be up 5-10% qoq in 1Q17,"" says Goldman. In addition, a weak Japanese yen is likely to add close to 4% to Western Digital's gross margin this coming year. All this has led to a 52% spike in Western Digital's stock price since Goldman panned it.
Late to the party, Goldman is upgrading Western Digital -- but only to neutral, as the analyst expects to be proven right...eventually.
Meanwhile, elsewhere on Wall Street, analysts have been warming up to AMD stock for some weeks now. This morning, Mizuho Securities joined the club with an endorsement for AMD stock, agreeing that it sees potential in the company's ProGFx, Ryzen and Zen chips for applications in deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI).
Mizuho sees these markets powering AMD's gross margin in years to come. In fact, it sees gross margin potentially doubling from ""~30%"" to perhaps 60% as early as Q2 2017. Applying these margins to as much as $1 billion in incremental revenue from DL, the analyst believes AMD could earn as much as $0.30 in extra operating profit next year.
Granted, even if this prediction comes true, Mizuho still doesn't see AMD turning profitable next year, but only losing $0.05 per share instead of $0.06 per share. But looking out to 2018, the analyst believes AMD could be solidly profitable, and earning as much as $0.14 per share across its several businesses.
If true, that would be great news for AMD investors -- profits at last, after five straight years (and soon to be six) of losing money. On the other hand, even $0.14 per share in profits would result in about a 93 P/E ratio on the stock -- which both seems a mite high, and won't materialize for two more years at the earliest.
Going back through our list in reverse order, Western Digital is also currently unprofitable, and likely to end 2016 with a loss. But next year, analysts are forecasting $2.02 per share in earnings, valuing the stock at about 35 times forward earnings based on today's $70 share price. Given analyst expectations for 10% long-term earnings growth, this also seems expensive.
And finally, in true ""first shall be last"" fashion, we come to NVIDIA. Goldman Sachs has very high hopes for this one, as we've seen. Investors should note, however, that the consensus among analysts is still for NVIDIA to earn no more than $2.44 per share next year. At the stock's current price of $105 and change, that works out to a forward P/E ratio of 43. Much as I like NVIDIA as a business, the stock still looks too rich for my blood.
Honestly, Wall Street may love all these stocks -- but I wouldn't touch any one of them.

Though there are certainly some challengers, it's hard to find a hotter tech stock than Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Heading into the finish line for 2016, AMD stock has risen an astronomical 275% in 2016, roughly 34 times the Nasdaq Composite's respectable 8% uptick for the year:

AMD data by YCharts.
No stock rises so fast without an underlying catalyst, and that is indeed the case with AMD shares. The company has done an admirable job making the most of its unique exposure to the computer microprocessor (CPU) and graphics (GPU) markets. So if AMD is doing so well, why is this article about better alternatives to its stock?
Despite its recent renaissance, AMD's business model isn't necessarily as bulletproof as its 2016 rally might imply. As you'll see, other semiconductor makers hold stronger competitive positions in the two core markets where AMD hopes to gain market share. Consequently, here are two better semiconductor stocks than AMD today.
After struggling to find a place in the mobile revolution, graphics processing unit (GPU) leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has found itself unexpectedly at the heart of some of the most exciting growth markets in tech today. Self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and big data might sound like buzz words to some, but to NVIDIA, they're core markets for its high-end graphics chips. In fact, NVIDIA saw double-digit growth in the three business segments that cater to these markets. In terms of being more attractive than AMD, this leadership position in higher-growth semiconductor markets would be enough to make NVIDIA the better buy.

However, NVIDIA remains better positioned in the market where it competes directly with AMD, despite recent success on AMD's part. It's no secret that AMD has stolen some of NVIDIA's market share for desktop GPUs, but this overlooks two important facts. First, the overall market for PC graphics chips is shrinking in terms of unit shipments, making AMD's success in this space somewhat less appealing. What is more, NVIDIA's popularity among gamers, an enthusiast market that covets top-notch performance, has allowed it to continue to increase costs in the face of falling PC sales. Furthermore, NVIDIA is rumored to be preparing a lower-cost graphics chip to defend its market share from AMD next year. So for long-term investors comparing the two, NVIDIA is a better choice.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) dominates the market for PC and server microprocessors, and a meaningful part of AMD's recent rally has been fueled by the assumption that AMD can steal some market share from Intel in one or both of these industries.
Much has been made of AMD's forthcoming Zen CPU, which could offer graphics advantages over Intel's current chips, as Intel's chip roadmap appears focused on driving computing-performance improvements as usual. It still seems more likely that consumer preferences will be biased toward valuing faster computing power over moderately improved graphics.
Looking at the bigger picture, Intel's massive resource advantage over AMD -- Intel's research-and-development budget is larger than AMD's total revenues  -- should insulate it from individual design wins that might translate into a longer-term shift away from its chips. Intel might not be the growth giant that it was a generation ago, but in my eyes its financial muscle and strong tradition of execution still make it a safer long-term bet than AMD's high-flying shares.
In many ways, this article is as much an argument for NVIDIA and Intel shares as it is a caution against AMD stock. As a company, AMD is undoubtedly improving. AMD has adeptly tapped into its core opportunity in the console gaming market, while looking to position its mix of computing and graphics know-how as an alternative to NVIDIA and Intel in their respective markets.
Though this strategy could certainly work, it will be hard to dislodge either NVIDIA or Intel from their respective positions of strength. As we've seen in other consumer-hardware verticals like the PC market, cost advantages rarely trump performance advantages, so in this way AMD remains at a disadvantage to both Intel and NVIDIA.
What's more, we're still early in AMD's comeback story, and the company has fallen badly on its face in the past. So while AMD shares have eviscerated the market over the past 12 months, it's far less clear that the company can do so again over the next 12.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have soared a staggering 280% year to date. The company is still unprofitable, but investors are betting that AMD is on the verge of a historic turnaround. Polaris, AMD's mainstream-oriented GPU, launched earlier this year, producing growth in the company's core business after a long streak of disappointing results. AMD is set to re-enter the high-end GPU market next year with Vega, and its Ryzen CPU, formerly known as Zen, will look to challenge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) during the first quarter.

AMD has also seen some momentum in an area that has been so far dominated by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Alphabet's Google announced last month that it planned to install both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs into its data centers, offering them as part of its cloud platform. While NVIDIA's products are already available through most of the major cloud-computing vendors, AMD has been slower out of the gate, making the Google deal a significant win for the company. Radeon Instinct, a new line of graphics cards aimed at machine learning set to launch in 2017, will put AMD in the running to power artificial intelligence workloads.
With such a large gain in such a short period of time, investors are right to ask: Can it last? If everything goes right for AMD next year, the stock could be in for further gains. But it won't take much going wrong for 2017 to be a bad year for the stock, even if it's a relatively good year for the company. Here are three reasons AMD stock could fall next year.

Looking at AMD's stock chart tells a story of extreme optimism followed by disappointment. Shares of AMD have spiked before, in the early 2000s and again around 2006, only to collapse when the company failed to deliver. The company's current market capitalization isn't yet at an all-time high, but it's at the highest level in nearly a decade.

AMD Operating Income (Annual) data by YCharts.
In AMD's best year in the past 10, the company managed to earn a net income of about $500 million. The market is currently valuing AMD at around 20 times that number. In other words, investors are not only betting that AMD will make a comeback, but that its profits will soar to record levels. That's a bold bet for a company that has a long history of disappointing investors.
This time could be different. AMD has a semi-custom business that's producing profits for the company, and it appears that Ryzen could give Intel a run for its money. But if the bull case doesn't unfold exactly as expected, a major correction could sting investors next year.
Polaris produced some growth for AMD, with its computing and graphics segment revenue jumping 11% year over year during the third quarter. But NVIDIA stole the show, registering 63% growth in its gaming segment, driven by its new Pascal graphics cards. Both companies benefited from strong demand for graphics cards during the quarter, but NVIDIA claimed a bigger piece of the pie.
Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform, collects hardware data from its users, and the most recent results suggest that NVIDIA's dominance isn't going away. The only Polaris graphics card to register on the survey is the RX 480, which claimed just 0.37% of Steam users in November. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's GTX 1080, 1070, and 1060, all higher-end cards launched around the same time, were being used by 0.86%, 1.59%, and 1.53% of users, respectively.
AMD plans to launch more powerful graphics cards based on its upcoming Vega GPU next year, hoping to challenge NVIDIA in the high-margin high end of the market. AMD is certainly in a better competitive position today than it was in a year ago, but Polaris hasn't been the runaway success that the company needed it to be. Vega will need to be a home run. If it's not, AMD investors could be in for a rough ride next year.
AMD recently provided details on Ryzen, its upcoming line of CPUs formerly known as Zen. Ryzen processors for desktops are expected to be available during the first quarter of 2017, with notebook variants coming during the second half. The company demonstrated that an eight-core version of Ryzen matched or beat Intel's i7 6900K in a few tasks, including image rendering and video transcoding.
Ryzen comes with some new features, including improved prefetching driven by learning algorithms meant to minimize bottlenecks, and a refined boost system that allows clock speeds to be adjusted. It's built on a 14-nanometer FinFET process, meaning that the manufacturing gap between AMD and Intel is at its narrowest in years. If Ryzen is competitive on a performance-per-dollar basis with Intel's chips, AMD could gain a meaningful amount of market share.
The only benchmarks we've seen so far have been from AMD, and at this point we know nothing about the more mainstream versions of Ryzen or the pricing. Ryzen needs to offer a compelling value proposition to compel Intel users to switch, and we won't know if that's the case until third-party benchmarks and pricing details surface. Even with Ryzen looking like it's going to be a competitive product, anything short of significant market share gains for AMD could send the stock tumbling.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is on a massive roll right now. Share prices have more than quadrupled over the last 52 weeks, and AMD stock is trading at prices not seen since 2007.
Investors are loving this rare return to form, but is it too late to jump aboard the AMD bandwagon? Let's have a deeper look at the risks involved in an AMD investment.
There's no doubt AMD has done a lot of things right in 2016. The company deserves kudos for the strong launch of a new graphics platform formerly known as Polaris. Even though graphics-segment arch-rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also bowed a fresh graphics platform to an equally warm welcome, Polaris chips made AMD an instant challenger in the supercomputing and data center markets. Yes, chips designed to handle digital graphics tasks happen to be great at other forms of intense number-crunching as well. So Polaris has opened a bunch of new doors for AMD.
In the words of CEO Lisa Su, AMD is now a high-performance computing company more than anything else. She is aiming her Polaris platform at a global market worth about $50 billion a year, including data center servers and immersive digital experiences. The company is only getting started on a multiyear roadmap, which includes a new general processing architecture launch in 2017.
These are the reasons AMD shares are trading near decade-spanning record prices today.
The shift into high-performance computing has not been completely smooth. Along the way, NVIDIA won the lucrative contract to power the next Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) console. Nintendo has been in AMD's pocket since the original Wii system, helping the company keep its proverbial nose above the water in recent years.
NVIDIA might also pose a serious challenge when the other console builders get around to launching the next generation of hardware systems. If so, about half of AMD's current revenue sources could be headed to NVIDIA instead. Sure, AMD could still win those contracts and keep its sales streams fairly intact, but losing Nintendo is not a positive sign in the early going. Investors must be prepared for the potential of a big setback here.
The thing is, investors are acting as if AMD were set up to deliver a steady stream of sustainable profits from here on out. And that's not even remotely true.
The company only occasionally manages to deliver positive operating profits, EBITDA earnings, or free cash flows. In general, you can expect the bottom-line numbers to show up deeply in the red. The overall trend isn't even positive.
AMD is sacrificing top-line revenue to explore new markets. That kind of move is usually expected to come with stronger profit margins, but not in AMD's case. Buying this stock today -- or holding on to your existing shares -- amounts to a bet on AMD's future prospects. The Polaris-based graphics boost needs to have legs, or the bottom falls out. On top of that, it's not enough to just maintain whatever positive trends the company has on the table today. AMD is still losing money by the bucketful, and it needs to tighten up the leaking ship.
Deliver on all of these promises, and AMD shares will hold steady -- or maybe rise even higher. Fall short anywhere at all, and that's the end of the new golden era.
Yes, this stock could skyrocket over the next several years if management executes flawlessly. But in my view, the chances of that happening are slim to none. It's a small boat in a big sea, surrounded on all sides by rivals with more experience and stronger balance sheets. AMD simply can't afford any mistakes, and perfection doesn't come easy.
Long story short, AMD investors will need an iron stomach.

Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) stock price has skyrocketed in 2016, jumping more than 260% since the beginning of the year. But this year brought more than just stock price gains for the company. 
AMD's revenues bounced back this year from one of their lowest points last year, and the company managed to expand its discrete desktop GPU market share against rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) as well. Additionally, AMD is poised to benefit from the expanding virtual reality market. 
Here's how all of this looks for AMD in three charts.
AMD's revenue has fallen about 28% from its five-year high, and it now sit at about $1.3 billion in the most recent quarter. But while the company is far below its five-year high, AMD's revenues are starting to move back in the right direction. The second and third quarters both saw positive revenue gains on a year-over-year basis, with the biggest jump -- 23% -- coming in the third quarter.

Much of the growth came from four straight quarters of growth in the company's professional graphics products. Investors should know that fourth-quarter revenues are expected to decline on a sequential basis as the company moves away from its usual ""annual semi custom sales peak in the third quarter."" But even with that decline, fourth-quarter revenue is expected to increase 12% year over year at the midpoint of guidance. 
AMD expects revenue to be up just 6% for full-year 2016. Investors should keep a close eye on the company's ability grow sales -- and whether it can continue pushing revenue back in the right direction as AMD heads into the new year. 
Another bright spot for AMD right now is the company's discrete desktop GPU market share. The company's graphics processors compete directly with NVIDIA, and while AMD is still an underdog, it's starting to gain momentum. 
Last year, AMD had fallen to about 18% market share, but it's slowly ticked up since then and now stands at about an estimated 30%.

AMD still has a long way to go to best NVIDIA's GPUs, but with the GPU market essentially a two-player game at this point, any gains AMD makes in the space should directly help the company's revenues. 
The virtual reality (VR) market is just getting started, but AMD is in fantastic position to benefit. Here's what the virtual reality opportunity looks like over the next few years, as combined sales of hardware and software jump from under $5 billion in 2016 to an estimated $40 billion by 2020 .

AMD's opportunity lies in its graphics cards for VR-ready computers, but also in its sales of GPUs for gaming consoles, like Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 4. Sony is shaping up to be a major player in the VR space. The company recently released its VR headset that's compatible with the PS4, PS4 Slim, and upgraded PS4 Pro, and it has already sold more than 50 million PS4 consoles to date. 
The company's new VR headset could help spur even more sales of the PS4 lineup, which would then boost sales of AMD's processors. With Sony teaming up with 230 developers and releasing new VR games and content, AMD is in the perfect position to benefit. 
While AMD has had a rough few years of falling revenue and discrete desktop GPU market share, the company appears to be making up for lost time. If it can can continue on this path -- and benefit from the rise of VR as well -- then AMD investors can expect another promising year from the company.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) made headlines on Monday with the introduction of Radeon Instinct, a line of GPU accelerators aimed specifically at deep learning systems. The company has offered products targeting data centers and high-performance computing for years with its FirePro graphics cards. But Radeon Instinct, along with the MIOpen open-source software that AMD announced alongside the new products, marks a shift in the company's strategy.

Image source: AMD.
Radeon Instinct will come in three flavors. The MI6 is based on AMD's Polaris GPU architecture, which powers the mainstream gaming graphics cards the company launched earlier this year. This card is aimed at neural network inference, where a trained neural network is used for an application. The MI8 is based on AMD's old Fiji architecture, featuring greater processing power and memory bandwidth, but a quarter of the memory. This card is also likely aimed at inference.
The MI25 is the big daddy of the bunch. Built around AMD's upcoming Vega GPU architecture, which will power the company's high-end gaming graphics cards next year, the MI25 offers a whopping 25 TFLOPs of half-precision floating-point performance. This card is aimed at neural network training, a more computationally intensive process than inference. For comparison, NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) P100 Tesla GPU clocks in at 21.2 TFLOPS in the best-case scenario, using the company's homegrown NVLink technology instead of standard PCIe.
Radeon Instinct products are expected to begin shipping during the first half of 2017. This news comes about one month after AMD scored a big data center win, with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google announcing that it would integrate the company's FirePro graphics cards into its cloud platform. Despite this apparent momentum, AMD remains far behind NVIDIA in the data center market generally and the A.I. acceleration market specifically. With additional competition from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)and even Google itself, it won't be smooth sailing for AMD.
NVIDIA has been talking about deep learning for years. The company's data center business is booming thanks to that early focus, closing in on a $1 billion annual run rate after tripling revenue year-over-year during the third quarter.

Image source: NVIDIA.
NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs are already offered by most of the major cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud. AMD's GPUs are absent from all three. Google will be adding NVIDIA's GPUs to its cloud platform along with AMD's, so while that announcement was a big win for AMD, it was also a win for NVIDIA.
According to an analyst at Nomura, NVIDIA enjoys an 80% share of the accelerator market. A vast amount of software has been ported to run on NVIDIA's GPUs, ranging from computational finance to scientific simulations, creating switching costs for those already using its products. The market for A.I. acceleration is still in its infancy, meaning that AMD is not incapable of catching up. But NVIDIA has a clear lead.
Intel has been trying to break into the accelerator market for years with its Xeon Phi line of products. The most recent, Knights Landing, has the advantage of acting as the main processor as well, offering customers potential costs savings. Intel stated earlier this year that it was aiming to move 100,000 units in 2016, a number that would make the product a major force in the accelerator market.
Intel is planning to launch a version of Xeon Phi, Knights Mill, aimed specifically at deep learning. Knights Mill will also feature the ability to act as the main processor when it launches next year, giving NVIDIA some serious competition in the A.I. acceleration market in addition to AMD's upcoming products.

Image source: Intel.
Google may pose a threat to all three companies in the long run. The search giant announced earlier this year that it had designed an application-specific-integrated-circuit in an effort to accelerate deep learnings tasks. Google is reportedly using more than 1,000 of the Tensor Processing Units in its data centers already.
In the same way that a GPU is more efficient than a CPU at graphics processing because it's designed at the hardware level for the kind of math involved, Google's TPU is more efficient than a GPU for inference because it's designed at the hardware level for that task. Google claims that its TPUs provide and order-of-magnitude improvement in performance per watt compared to GPUs.
AMD is playing catch up when it comes to deep learning. Like NVIDIA, AMD is betting that GPUs are the future of A.I. acceleration. But ASICs like Google's TPU could upend both companies' long-term plans. If other cloud computing vendors move to design their own custom chips for deep learning, the GPU vendors could be left out in the cold.
AMD's Radeon Instinct is the company's first real attempt at going after NVIDIA in the A.I. acceleration market. If the company can price the cards competitively, it could be a very profitable endeavor. But the threat of Intel is looming, and the potential for custom chips to eventually displace GPUs is very real. AMD investors should be happy that the company is taking deep learning seriously. But they also shouldn't get ahead of themselves.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 23.2% in November, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The big news during the month was an announcement from Alphabet's Google that it was installing both AMD and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs in its cloud data centers.
NVIDIA has had great success getting cloud computing companies to buy its pricey Tesla GPUs. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud already offer GPU cloud computing services via NVIDIA's products. Google's announcement, which will put AMD's FirePro S9300 x2 and two NVIDIA Telsa GPUs on offer through its cloud platform beginning next year, is a significant win for both companies.
NVIDIA's data center business is now at an annual run rate of nearly $1 billion, while AMD doesn't break out data center revenue. The opportunity for AMD is immense if the company can continue to win cloud computing deals. An analyst last month estimated that artificial intelligence offers a $15 billion opportunity for semiconductor companies. Even grabbing a fraction of that total would be a boon for AMD.
AMD stock has been on a tear this year, driven by growing optimism that the company is finally on the verge of turning things around. The launch of its mainstream Polaris graphics cards earlier this year has produced revenue growth in its core computing and graphics business, but the company remains unprofitable. Next year, AMD will launch new Zen CPUs and Vega high-end GPUs, both of which will need to be successful for the company to grow into its valuation.

More good news in December has pushed shares of AMD even higher. A rumor emerged on Dec. 6 that AMD and Intel had signed a licensing agreement that would put AMD's GPU technology into Intel's CPUs. There's been no confirmation of any deal at this point, but it's possible that this deal will replace a cross-licensing agreement between Intel and NVIDIA that expires early next year. If that's the case, AMD could see annual payments from Intel. However, AMD graphics showing up in Intel CPUs seems unlikely.
2017 will be a big year for AMD, with the ultimate success of its turnaround set to be determined by the launch of new products. The Google deal in November was a positive, but the company remains far behind NVIDIA.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has been one of the best performing tech stocks this year, surging over 230% and crushing the NASDAQ's 8% gain. However, these five catalysts could drive the stock even higher in 2017.

Image source: AMD.
AMD's turnaround in 2016 was fueled by robust sales of its semi-custom SoCs (system on chips) for Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. That turned the EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit into its core pillar of growth, and offset declines at its Computing and Graphics unit. 
That shift boosted AMD's quarterly revenue by 8% annually during the second quarter this year (its first quarter of positive year-over-year growth in two years) and another 23% during the third quarter. That turnaround also lifted its non-GAAP earnings back into the black. Analysts now believe that AMD can finish this year with 6% sales growth, compared to a 28% decline in 2015. 
Console sales often wane after the first year, but Sony and Microsoft are both updating their consoles with slimmer form factors and beefier specs for 4K and VR gaming. These new versions should continue supporting AMD's EESC unit in 2017 and beyond.
Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive piqued consumer interest in high-end VR games for PCs, but many current PCs aren't powerful enough for those headsets. The initial batch of ""VR ready"" PCs cost around $1,000, but AMD reduced that price to about $600 with its RX 480 graphics cards.

RX 480. Image source: AMD. 
The Rift and Vive are still pricey, with respective price tags of $600 and $800, but those prices should come down next year as component prices decline and competition from mobile and console-based headsets heats up. When that happens, demand for AMD's low-end ""VR ready"" cards could rise and finally help it push back against market leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, NVIDIA is also eyeing the same market with competitively priced VR ready cards like the GTX 1060.
AMD also plans to launch its next-gen Vega GPUs in the near future. Leaked specs indicate that the Vega 10 will boast 12 teraflops of processing power, which outperforms the 11 teraflops squeezed out by NVIDIA's $1,200 GTX Titan X. 
If AMD sticks with its strategy of selling cards at lower price points than NVIDIA, it might just win back some high-end users. But it's still a long road back -- research firm JPR claims that AMD controlled just 29% of the add-in board market in the third quarter, compared to NVIDIA's 71% share. NVIDIA also spent 44% more on R&D than AMD last quarter, indicating that it could quickly match the Vega challengers with its own next-gen chipsets.
Over the past few years, AMD was marginalized in the x86 CPU market by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD offered cheaper chips, but Intel's Core CPUs crushed AMD's in terms of single-threaded performance (which is crucial for high-end gaming). According to PassMark GPU benchmarks, Intel CPUs now account for 83% of the x86 market, while AMD CPUs account for 17%. That loss of market share, exacerbated by sluggish demand for PCs, caused AMD's x86 business to become a dead weight.
However, AMD doesn't plan to simply surrender this market to Intel. Its long-awaited Zen CPUs, which are scheduled to arrive early next year, promise to offer better single-threaded performance for game engines and improved multi-threaded performance for newer graphics APIs. Depending on how competitively they're priced against Intel's high-end Core i5 and i7 offerings, the Zen might help AMD finally regain some lost market share in the tough x86 market.
AMD is constantly cited as a potential takeover target for bigger chipmakers. Its enterprise value of $8.4 billion is fairly low compared to other chipmakers, and it's the only remaining licensee of x86 chips.
Intel, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Oracle, and even Microsoft were named as potential suitors before, but no concrete talks have ever emerged. With the semiconductor market consolidating rapidly and AMD's finances improving, a hostile bidding war could theoretically erupt over the chipmaker in the near future. If that happens, we could see some big premium offers since AMD only trades at 2 times sales. By comparison, Intel and Qualcomm respectively have P/S ratios of 3 and 4.
At the beginning of the year, I questioned AMD's ability to survive its market share losses, sales declines, and rising debt. But under CEO Lisa Su, the chipmaker wisely used robust growth in its EESC unit to support the development of new chipsets to challenge NVIDIA and Intel. While it will still be tough to reclaim market share from those bigger rivals, AMD has given investors fresh hope that its stock could keep rising over the next few years.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped on Thursday due to an analyst upgrade that featured a significant price target boost. The upgrade comes after a string of positive news for AMD, including a cloud computing deal and rumors of a licensing pact with Intel. The stock rose as much as 11.5% on the news of the upgrade, settling into an 8.3% gain by 2:30 p.m. EST
Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded AMD from underperform to buy on Thursday, citing turnaround progress and a massive opportunity ahead of it as it looks to challenge both Intel and NVIDIA. Success in semi-custom chips was also a factor in the upgrade. While AMD's core CPU and GPU business has been posting losses for quite some time, semi-custom chips powering all of the major game consoles have provided a much-needed source of revenue and profits for the company.
Merrill Lynch assigned a $12 price target to shares of AMD, with a $15-plus bull case target and a $7 bear case target. AMD stock has rocketed higher this year on the hope that its new GPU and CPU products would propel the company back to profitability. That hasn't happened yet, but Merrill Lynch sees a growth opportunity for the company that is ""too large to ignore.""

This is the third time in recent weeks that shares of AMD have surged on a positive piece of news. The stock jumped in mid-November when Alphabet's Google announced that it was adding both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs to its cloud platform. AMD is far behind NVIDIA when it comes to getting its server GPUs into cloud data centers, so the deal was a meaningful win for the company.
Another jump came earlier this week when a rumor emerged that AMD had signed a licensing deal with Intel to put its GPU technology into Intel processors. The deal has not yet been confirmed, and it may simply replace a licensing deal between Intel and NVIDIA that expires next year. An annual payment to AMD may be in the cards, but the prospect of Intel using AMD's GPUs in its processors seems unlikely.
A flurry of good news has pushed AMD stock higher in the past month. The company will need to deliver next year when it launches its Zen CPUs and Vega GPUs in order to justify its higher valuation.

Economist John Maynard Keynes is generally credited with the quote, ""When the facts change, I change my mind."" Today, it's Merrill Lynch (CAPS rating: 93.93) that is putting the quote into practice.
According to StreetInsider.com, it's been more than two years since Bank of America's Merrill Lynch brokerage unit downgraded semiconductor chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to underperform, assigning the stock a $4 price target on worries that the perpetually underperforming AMD just couldn't effectively compete with rivals such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Since that rating came out, however, AMD shares have not fallen, but instead climbed to nearly $10 as of this writing. And with this ""fact"" having changed, Merrill Lynch has decided to change its opinion of AMD stock today -- and upgraded the stock two notches, from underperform to buy.
Here are three things you need to know about that upgrade.
Merrill Lynch ponders the future of ""deep learning"" computers, and has a rethink about AMD stock. Image source: Getty Images.
In a rare mea culpa, Merrill Lynch admitted today that it missed out on the turnaround in AMD's business -- and in its stock price earlier this year.
Quoted on TheFly.com this morning, the banker explains that it was ""too concerned"" about AMD's history of ""weak execution, high debt, and competitive risks"" from Intel and NVIDIA. In focusing on the company's disappointing history, Merrill says it may have missed the unfolding story of AMD's rising strength in PC gaming, artificial intelligence, and computer deep learning. AMD's progress in these areas, says Merrill, has led to gains in chip market share for AMD.
At the same time, Merrill Lynch gives AMD's new CEO Lisa Su credit for shoring up AMD's balance sheet. With nearly $1.3 billion in cash on its books, S&P Global Market Intelligence data show that AMD has grown its cash reserves by roughly 25% since Merrill Lynch first downgraded it back in July of 2014. At the same time, AMD has shrunk its long-term indebtedness to just $1.6 billion.
Result: Cash on hand is nearly sufficient to balance out debt at AMD, and at the same time, says Merrill, AMD has succeeded in refinancing the debt it still carries, pushing out its due date and giving the firm breathing room as it continues to build cash.
Factoring all these improvements into consideration, Merrill Lynch says that the same AMD stock it previously thought to be worth only $4 is now worth three times more -- $12 a share. And with AMD stock still selling for less than $10 a share today, that means there's more than 20% upside in the stock.
But is Merrill Lynch right about that?
That's really hard to say, because while AMD's improvements are obvious, it's still not obvious that AMD stock is a better buy than Intel or NVIDIA, say.
Debt may be down and cash may be up, but S&P Global data show that AMD is still burning cash at the rate of $127 million a year. Under GAAP accounting standards, the stock looks even worse, with net losses of $548 million over the past 12 months. In contrast, both Intel and NVIDIA are GAAP-profitable companies, and both are generating not just positive free cash flow, but free cash flow actually superior to their reported GAAP profits -- $10.6 billion in FCF for Intel, and $1.2 billion for NVIDIA, over the past 12 months.
Long story short: I can't deny that AMD has made improvements in its business. I cannot say that Merrill Lynch is wrong when it peers into the future, sees these improvements continuing, and believes that despite its losses and despite its cash burn, AMD has a bright future ahead of it. All I can do is point to the multiple instances when other analysts have predicted similar turnarounds for AMD -- and been proven wrong.
AMD's financial picture looks a whole lot prettier today than it did just two years ago, but Intel and NVIDIA aren't sitting still, and AMD still has a long way to go to make up the gap between it and its more successful rivals. To cite another famous quote, I'm still not convinced that this leopard has changed its spots.

            ","With the market hovering near historic highs, it seems tough to find stocks with much upside potential. However, just because a stock surged over the past year doesn't mean that it will run out of steam next year. Let's take a look at three tech stocks which rallied in 2016 but might make investors even richer in 2017 -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), MeetMe (NASDAQ:MEET), and Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB).

AMD seemed doomed earlier this year as its stock fell below $2. Intel was crushing its CPU business, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) was marginalizing its GPU business. But the chipmaker bounced back on the strength of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which produced SoCs for non-PC platforms like gaming consoles, including the PS4 and Xbox One.
Robust sales of those consoles helped AMD post 8% annual sales growth during its second quarter earnings in July -- marking its first quarter of positive year-over-year revenue growth in two years. It followed that up with 23% annual growth in the third quarter and a return to non-GAAP profitability. 
AMD is now fighting back against NVIDIA with new low-end ""VR ready"" GPUs, and its upcoming Vega chipset could challenge NVIDIA in the high-end market. It also plans to take on Intel's x86 dominance with its powerful new Zen CPUs early next year. AMD's success definitely isn't guaranteed in either market, but analysts believe that it could post 7% sales growth and a non-GAAP profit next year. If AMD can exceed those expectations, it could have much more room to run despite rallying over 220% in 2016.
MeetMe's social networking app helps users find new people to chat with. The small cap company, which acquired rival platform Skout earlier this year, had over 8.5 million monthly active users (MAUs) at the end of last quarter. That seems tiny compared to Match Group's Tinder, which has around 50 million MAUs, but MeetMe has a robust presence among millennials and is rapidly growing.

The app's mobile MAUs rose 32% year-over-year last quarter, and its mobile revenue soared 39% to $16 million. Total revenues, mainly generated by in-app ads, grew 20% to $17.2 million. Non-GAAP earnings rose 30% to $6.2 million, GAAP earnings surged 316% to $4.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA improved 31%. 
Analysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to respectively rise 38% and 17% next year. MeetMe already advanced nearly 40% this year, but it still trades at less than 7 times earnings, compared to the average P/E of 50 for internet information providers. MeetMe's growth might eventually peak, but I believe that its stock could still double or triple from current levels if its growth stays consistent. 
Carbonite offers cloud backup services for SMBs (small and medium sized businesses) with fewer than 300 employees. The cloud backup space might seem crowded, but market behemoths like Microsoft and IBM generally focus on large enterprises instead of SMBs. 
This enabled Carbonite -- which beefed up by acquiring Seagate's EVault cloud backup service in January -- to carve out a growing niche in the SMB market. Carbonite's revenue grew a whopping 50% annually to $51.9 million last quarter, and non-GAAP net income rose 80% to $3.8 million. The company also generated a slim GAAP net profit of $107,000, compared to a loss of nearly $6 million in the prior year quarter. Its adjusted free cash flow more than tripled to $4.5 million.
Much of Carbonite's growth this year was inflated by the EVault acquisition, but analysts still expect it to post 7% sales growth and 19% earnings growth next year. Carbonite already rallied nearly 90% this year, but it still trades at 27 times forward earnings -- which remains lower than its industry average of 29. 
AMD, MeetMe, and Carbonite all crushed the market in 2016, and they could continue to do so next year. However, all three companies face clear headwinds -- AMD's efforts against Intel and NVIDIA could flop, MeetMe could be crushed by Tinder, and Carbonite could be marginalized by its larger rivals. But if they overcome those challenges, these stocks could continue soaring and make investors very happy.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged on Tuesday after a rumor emerged that AMD and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had signed a deal involving AMD's Radeon graphics technology. AMD stock was up about 9.9% at 3 p.m. EST, while Intel stock was up about 1%.
The rumors of a deal between AMD and Intel first emerged in a forum post from Kyle Bennett, chief editor at HardOCP. According to Bennett, Intel is licensing AMD's graphics technology with plans to integrate it into future processors.
Intel and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) currently have a cross-licensing agreement that gives Intel access to some of NVIDIA's patents, but it expires in early 2017. There has been no news regarding a renewal of this agreement, and it's possible that Intel has instead signed a similar deal with AMD. It's unclear if the agreement, if it turns out to be more than a rumor, will involve cash payments.
Speculation that Intel will use AMD's GPU's in its processors is probably unfounded. The most likely scenario is that a deal between AMD and Intel is simply a replacement for the NVIDIA deal.
The jump in AMD's stock price is based on sparse rumors; nothing has been confirmed by anyone at this point. A deal may involve payments to AMD, which would shore up the company's balance sheet as it prepares to launch its Zen processors next year. But the idea that Intel is going to use AMD's GPUs in its processors seems far-fetched to me.
In any event, this is probably good news for AMD and, depending on the nature of the deal, bad news for NVIDIA. But we'll need to wait for more information to know for sure.

It's the classic story of David versus Goliath. Or, it used to be -- but things have been changing lately. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) aren't the unambiguous head-to-head rivals they used to be.
So, what's new in this storied matchup, and which stock should you buy today?
Let's find out.
If you're looking for massive market momentum, there is no contest, here. Intel has traded roughly in line with the S&P 500 over the last year, but AMD shares have tripled year to date and nearly quadrupled over the last 52 weeks.
Image source: AMD.
Of course, AMD started that climb from a deep, dark well.
Six years ago, AMD shares traded at $7.50 per share. The next five years saw AMD sliding 70% lower, landing at $2.22 in November, 2015. Revenues were plunging and the company was burning enormous amounts of cash. Weak PC sales and a soft market for video game consoles added up to bad news for AMD investors.
By 2015, it was not obvious that AMD would avoid a bankruptcy in the long run.
After a false start based on unproven buyout rumors, AMD started a real comeback in January. A solid fourth-quarter report was followed by three positive earnings surprises. The company launched an all-new graphics chip architecture to wide acclaim, and investors are looking forward to an equally radical redesign of AMD's PC processor cores in early 2017.
Once left for dead, AMD now looks like a vital business with a serious shot at revenue growth and steady profits. That's how the stock reached today's high levels.
From here, even the bulls think the stock looks fairly valued. Buy ratings are based on future revenue growth, not expanding valuation ratios. The upcoming launch of the Zen processor architecture will be a make-or-break moment for AMD. The company did a good job with the Polaris graphics platform, which improves the odds for a decent Zen introduction.
Still, AMD remains a risky bet until the company can get a truly solid financial footing again. Zen is going up against Intel's best server and desktop chips, and that's always a daunting challenge. At this point, I'm happy to stay on the sidelines and wait for the Zen introduction. Makes no sense to make a blind bet on a dark horse, after all.
If 2016 was a year of transition for AMD, the same was also true for Intel.
The chip giant reduced its headcount by 11% this year, then installed a new CFO and decided to spin off its security operations under the McAfee brand. Intel continued to exceed earnings estimates at every beat, but gloomy guidance led to a dramatic haircut in January.
Image source: Intel.
However, Intel is a far larger and more stable business than AMD. The last four quarters generated $10.5 billion of free cash flows, even though Intel is ramping up its capital expenses again. This company has the financial freedom to take chances and try out new markets without betting the entire farm.
The revamped strategy points to data center servers and the Internet of Things. The traditional PC market will continue to shrink, but Intel is making up for that drag with improvements in those two core markets.
Would I add more Intel shares to my existing holdings at today's prices? Maybe not. The stock is riding relatively high at the moment, just short of the multiyear highs Intel reached in October. For the moment, I'm happy to stick with the shares I already own.
That being said, I just might take another dip into Intel shares the next time this high-quality stock takes a sharp fall for no good reason. It happens more often than you'd think.
The high-stakes gamblers out there might want to take a deeper look at AMD. For the rest of us, Intel is the lower-risk way to go.

            ","A stock's value is not indicated by its market price. The profitability of a specific company compared with how many shares it has outstanding is what matters, meaning that a stock trading below $10 could be more valuable than a stock trading at $100 if there is more profitability per share to be expected in the future or some other benefit such as high dividend yield.
That said, sometimes there is value to be found in looking at stocks that have been beaten up by the market and could still have the potential for future gains. Here are few of those downtrodden stocks that could make nice little positions in a diversified portfolio.  
Fitbit Inc. (NYSE:FIT) stock was crushed in late October, when the company's disappointing Q3 earnings report guided for a lousy fourth quarter, a time when holiday sales usually mean upward revisions. For the third quarter itself, even though sales grew 23% year over year, net income was cut nearly in half, and sales growth was far slower than in years past.
Image source: Fitbit.
However, while those figures look grim, the company is still the global leader in wearables, and its market share ticked slightly upward in the most recent figures from the IDC, the leading source of wearables market share data. Fitbit's new products have all been more or less upgrades to its basic product, a wrist-based tracker, but the company has begun to massively increase spending on research and development, which was up more than 150% in Q3 year over year, and could mean future products that help diversify revenue. Additionally, Fitbit looks to be one of the best suited to take advantage of the growing trend of companies and insurers using fitness tracking to try to decrease employee health insurance costs.
Annaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY) just barely makes the cut-off for this list, after a small decline since August has dropped the stock to around $10. Annaly deals mostly in mortgage-backed securities or other real estate-related investment securities, but it has the ability to venture into new kinds of investments, which has helped to diversify its portfolio, and now has around $8 billion in holdings. Though the stock price has been pressured recently, Annaly is one of the biggest in its field, and its 20-year history means it's probably adequately prepared to weather current global macro conditions.   
What makes this stock especially attractive is its incredible dividend yield at over 10%. Though the most recent quarterly dividend of $0.26 is a slight drop from $0.30 over the past three years, that seems to be partially because Annaly is in the process of acquiring another company, so there doesn't seem to be much concern that the dividend will continue to be cut. 
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the key competitors in the circuit board and microchip market that's powering some of the most exciting industries such as autonomous cars, artificial intelligence, and more. Though much smaller than some of its big-name rivals in this space, AMD is still likely to gain from a vastly expanding industry. 
Shares of AMD rose nearly 10% in the last week, after the company announced a deal with Alphabet's Google, which plans to add AMD's Radeon-based FirePro server GPUs to its cloud platform in 2017, a major win for the company since it helps it to compete with bigger rivals already partnered with other big names in the cloud computing space. 
Like many energy companies, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) shares have been hammered in the past two years, as low oil prices and other macro or geopolitical forces have hurt the business. Chesapeake's shares had fallen from around $28 in 2013 to just $1.59 per share in February of this year. The stock has ticked up since then, which could be the start of stabilization in the industry and a rebound for those companies best positioned in it. Chesapeake and the entire energy industry could go through an interesting transition as Donald Trump takes office in January, following campaign promises to ""unleash America's $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves.""
Image source: Chesapeake
Chesapeake explores for and develops sources of natural gas and oil and also provides midstream services for other producers. In its most recent quarter, revenue was down 33% year over year, but its earnings per share of $0.09 beat expectations of a $0.03 loss. At an investor day in October, Chesapeake management revised its production guidance upward 5% to 15% annually through 2020. Note, however, that the company remains highly leveraged and that could drag on future growth.  
WisdomTree (NASDAQ:WETF) is an ETF provider that, since its inception in 2006, has grown to sponsor 94 distinct ETFs that span asset classes and countries around the world. Over the past year, certain negative market trends, particularly in Japan and Europe, have hurt the company's earnings and stock price.
However, things look good for WidsomTree going forward, including new products being launched such as ""smart beta fixed income,"" as well as ETFs focused on new geographies. While the company weathers current market trends, the stock could be cheap for a well-performing company. Most recently, WisdomTree acquired a 36% equity interest in AdvisorEngine (formerly known as Vanare), which is a digital wealth management platform that enables individual customization of portfolios.
What do all of these stocks have in common? They've all been generally unloved by the market, and their stock prices have consequently been pushed into this low price range. For that, there could be some value left in them for unexpected growth -- but be careful, as these will certainly be riskier than other options.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged for the second day in a row on Thursday following the announcement that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google planned to integrate AMD's server GPUs into its cloud platform. AMD stock was up about 9.5% at 3:30 p.m. EST, adding to a gain of nearly 10% on Wednesday.
Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) already has a presence at most of the major cloud-computing vendors, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and IBM's cloud platform. For AMD, the Google deal marks the second significant cloud win for the company in recent months, following a deal that will put its GPUs into Alibaba's cloud.
The Google deal represents progress for AMD, which has failed to capitalize on the growing trend of GPUs being used in the data center to the same extent as NVIDIA. NVIDIA's data center business is booming, with revenue tripling during the third quarter, to $240 million. AMD doesn't break out its data center GPU sales.
While some optimism is warranted due to this deal, Google is also adding NVIDIA GPUs to its cloud platform. This move fits in with Google's general push to make its cloud platform heterogeneous, not dependent on any single vendor. The company is working on developing a server based on IBM's POWER9 CPU, for example. Supporting both major GPU vendors makes sense given this strategy.
A recent note from analyst Ian Ing estimates that artificial intelligence could be a $15 billion opportunity for chip companies by 2025. NVIDIA is singled out as having an advantage in this area, while AMD is considered ""too resource constrained to fully address the opportunity."" With AMD fighting to win back market share in the GPU and CPU markets on a research and development budget that has been slashed over the past few years, that concern seems valid.
The Google cloud deal is certainly good news for AMD. But a 20% move in two days is hard to justify.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged on Wednesday, with the stock up 11.2% at its peak. News that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google plans to add AMD's Radeon-based FirePro server GPUs to its cloud platform in 2017 seems to be the main driver. The stock had settled a bit by 2:45 p.m. EST, up about 9.25%.
AMD is playing catch-up to rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) when it comes to cloud computing. NVIDIA has been focused on getting its Telsa GPUs into cloud data centers for years, and the company recently announced a blowout third quarter featuring a tripling of its data-center revenue. NVIDIA's GPUs are already available for users of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and IBM's cloud platform.
Beginning in 2017, AMD's FirePro S9300 x2 server GPUs, the company's most powerful, will be used to accelerate Google Compute Engine and Google Cloud Machine Learning services. Possible use cases include medical and financial simulations, machine learning, and video rendering and transcoding.
""The adoption of AMD GPU technology in Google Cloud Platform is a validation of the progress AMD has made in GPU hardware and our Radeon Open Compute Platform, which is the only fully open source hyperscale GPU compute platform in the world today,"" Said Raja Koduri, SVP and chief architect, Radeon Technologies Group, AMD. ""We expect that our momentum in GPU computing will continue to accelerate with future hardware and software releases and advances in the ecosystem of middleware and libraries.""
It's important to note that Google will also be adding NVIDIA's Tesla P100 and K80 GPUs to its cloud platform next year, so this isn't bad news for NVIDIA. For AMD, it represents tangible progress in the company's effort to become a major player in the accelerator market. NVIDIA's GPUs remain far more prevalent among cloud-computing providers, but this is a step in the right direction for AMD.
Still, a 10% jump in the stock price seems excessive. No details on the quantity of GPUs were given, so it's unclear exactly how big of a deal this is. Given Google's choice to add GPUs from both companies, this is as much a win for NVIDIA as it is for AMD.

Polaris was supposed to be a big deal for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The RX 480, launched in late June, and the RX 470 and RX 460, launched in August, went after the mainstream portion of the graphics card market aggressively. After losing substantial market share to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past few years and watching its graphics and computing segment plunge into the red, AMD bet on Polaris to begin its comeback.
The situation did improve for AMD during the third quarter. The computing and graphics segment, which includes graphics cards as well as PC CPUs, posted year-over-year revenue growth of about 11%, driven by higher GPU sales. The segment was still unprofitable, but less so compared to the prior-year period.
Unfortunately for AMD, this progress has been completely overshadowed by NVIDIA's blowout third quarter. Revenue grew 54% year over year, with gaming revenue surging 63%. Pascal-based graphics cards, including the GTX 1080, GTX 1070, and GTX 1060, led the way to a record quarter for NVIDIA.
It's important to put the numbers in perspective. NVIDIA's gaming segment, which doesn't include GPUs used for professional or data center applications, generated $1.24 billion of revenue during the third quarter. AMD's computing and graphics segment, which includes gaming GPUs, professional GPUs, and PC processors, produced just $472 million of revenue. The change in NVIDIA's gaming revenue compared to the prior-year period -- $483 million -- was greater than the revenue produced by AMD's core business.
Even before NVIDIA reported its results, there were some bad signs for AMD. The company cut prices on its two lower-end Polaris graphics cards following NVIDIA's announcement of the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti in October. Those cards, priced at $109 and $139, went directly after the RX 460 and RX 470 from AMD, effectively ending AMD's time as the leader in the mainstream portion of the market.
Another data point that suggests that Polaris is falling short comes from Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform. According to Steam's survey data, the RX 480 was owned by just 0.28% of Steam users in October, making it less than one-fourth as popular as NVIDIA's GTX 1070, which is substantially more expensive. None of AMD's other Polaris-based graphics cards registered on the survey at all.
Polaris represents just one part of AMD's turnaround strategy. In 2017, the company plans to launch high-end Vega graphics cards aimed at competing with NVIDIA's high-end offerings, as well as new Zen CPUs. Vega is expected to offer gamers an alternative to NVIDIA's high-end Pascal graphics cards, while Zen promises major performance gains that could drive share gains in the PC and server CPU markets.
If Polaris is any indication, though, investors may want to dial back their expectations. AMD's mainstream graphics strategy sounded great on paper, but execution has been disappointing. NVIDIA's gaming business is accelerating, despite the much-hyped launch of Polaris.
One major contributing factor to AMD's troubles is the company's shrinking research and development (R&D) budget. Just $947 million went toward R&D in 2015, down from $1.2 billion in 2013. Slashing R&D spending has helped bring the company closer to profitability, but expecting AMD to be able to close its technological gap with NVIDIA while spending far less on R&D may be unrealistic. For comparison, NVIDIA spent $1.33 billion on R&D in 2015, despite its narrower focus on graphics.
AMD's task only becomes more difficult going forward, with the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti now widely available. If Polaris-based graphics cards could only drive middling growth while facing little direct competition, it's hard to imagine growth accelerating now that NVIDIA has a strong mainstream presence.

            ","Many investors generally see stocks tripling as a long-term goal. But some stocks can also triple within a single year. Let's examine three tech stocks which tripled investors' investments over the past year, and whether or not they still have room to run. 

Image source: Getty Images.
If you had bought shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) when the stock dipped below $2 per share in February, you would have more than tripled your initial investment in just nine months. That's because the chipmaker staged a remarkable turnaround over the past year on the strength of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which was bolstered by robust sales of its semi-custom SoC for PS4s and Xbox Ones. Those sales are expected to keep rising on console upgrades like the PS4 Slim, PS4 Pro, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio.
In the second quarter this year, AMD posted its first quarter of annual revenue growth since 2014. It followed up that 9% growth with 23% growth in the third quarter, and anticipates 6% sales growth for the full year. AMD returned to quarterly GAAP profitability during the second quarter, and non-GAAP profitability during the third quarter.
AMD is also pushing back against Nvidia in the low-end ""VR ready"" GPU market with the Polaris-based RX 480, and plans to target the high-end market with its next-gen Vega GPUs in the near future. Although AMD remains a distant underdog to Intel in the CPU market, it plans to counter the market leader with its upcoming Zen CPUs.
Oclaro (NASDAQ:OCLR) is a manufacturer of optical components, modules, and subsystems for the service provider, enterprise, and data center markets. If you had bought shares of Oclaro last October when it hovered around $2, you would have quadrupled your initial investment. 
Oclaro directly benefits from the rising bandwidth needs of streaming video, cloud computing, application virtualization, and other data-intensive applications. That rising demand boosted its revenue by 55% annually last quarter, compared to 52% growth in the previous quarter and a 2% decline in the prior-year quarter. Most of that growth was fueled by growth in its ""100G and beyond"" portfolio of high-speed solutions, where sales rose roughly 20% annually for the fifth straight quarter.
On the bottom line, Oclaro's non-GAAP net income rose from a net loss of $1.6 million to net income of $20 million between the first quarters of 2015 and 2016. It also reported GAAP net income of $3.4 million during the quarter, versus a loss of $3.5 million a year ago. Analysts expect that growth to continue, with revenue and non-GAAP earnings expect to respectively rise 44% and 206% this year.
Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), commonly referred to as ""China's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR),"" has more than tripled in value since last October. That explosive growth can be attributed to its rapid growth in monthly active users (MAUs), which grew 33% annually to 282 million last quarter, compared to 36% growth in the prior-year quarter. The company -- which is owned by online media giant Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) -- has posted triple and double-digit sales growth in every quarter since its IPO in April 2014, and analysts expect its sales to rise 33% this year, compared to 43% growth in 2015.
Those numbers are enormous when compared to Twitter's anemic 3% year-over-year growth in MAUs and projected sales growth of 15% this year. Weibo is also profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP metrics, while Twitter is only profitable on a non-GAAP basis. Between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016, Weibo's GAAP net income rose from $4.2 million to $25.9 million, while its non-GAAP net income surged from $10.9 million to $35.5 million. Analysts expect its non-GAAP net income to more than double this year.
Weibo's advertising and marketing revenue rose 45% annually last quarter, fueled by ad buys from small and medium sized businesses nearly doubling. It offers display ads, interest-based ad campaigns, event-based ad campaigns, and promoted feeds. Weibo's new live streaming platform, which allows viewers to buy virtual gifts from the company for their favorite broadcasters, is also boosting its revenue growth.
Investors should always remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. However, AMD is still in turnaround mode, while Oclaro and Weibo still seem to be firing on all cylinders. Therefore, I believe that these stocks could still have room to run, despite having more than tripled investors' cash over the past year.

Pop quiz: What do you get when a company's stock rises 228% in a year while it also loses $548 million over this same period?
My answer: A precarious valuation.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been on an incredible tear over the past 12 months:

AMD data by YCharts.
As you'll see below, some of the newfound optimism bolstering AMD stock is deserved. However, the extent of a yearlong rally has also driven AMD shares to heights that the company's underlying business fundamentals seem unlikely to support, and investors eyeing AMD shares today should do so with extreme caution.
Advanced Micro Devices occupies something of a precarious place in the eyes of many longtime semiconductor sector observers. Long the distant second fiddle to Intel in the market for the x86 microprocessors that power the PC industry,  AMD has struggled to maintain consistent profitability since the turn of the millennium, which has had disastrous results for its volatile stock price over the long term.

AMD Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.
In recent years, though, AMD experienced something of an unexpected renaissance. The growth in graphics-intensive computing tasks related to self-driving cars, big-data imaging, virtual reality, and even high-end video games drove a surge in demand for the graphics chips made by AMD and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).
The two GPU specialists differ in one essential characteristic: NVIDIA has traditionally occupied the high-end, high-performance piece of the market, while AMD has offered more affordable, mass-market chipsets. And its status as the everyman's GPU maker has proven to be an especially large benefit to AMD today. For example, it recently introduced the first $200 GPU -- the Radeon RX 480 -- a feat that could help lower the cost a VR-quality computer to around $600. Since the cost of many VR-ready PCs can run well into the thousands of dollars, a compelling mix of price and performance has fueled market-share gains for AMD in the market for PC graphics chips, even as the market for PC GPUs as a whole continues to decline. To counter this success, AMD's rival NVIDIA recently introduced its own $200 graphics chip design, the GeForce GTX 1060, and it's this kind of behavior that may threaten AMD's prospects in PC graphics chips. The broader implication here is that NVIDIA is willing to devalue its traditional high-end chips to defend its market share, and that doesn't bode well for AMD's continued surge in this space.
AMD has also been able to translate its abilities in both CPUs and GPUs to create single systems on a chip (SoCs) that can handle most core computing tasks for video game consoles like the Microsoft Xbox One and Sony PS4. The company indeed deserves credit from investors here: It appears to have established a profitable niche in console SoCs. However, despite AMD's clear opportunities and recent successes, shares have ventured into the realm of the overvalued.
AMD's business has indeed improved, but its soaring stock price seems difficult to justify, even looking to the medium term. For context, AMD's current lack of profits this year and its expectation for continued losses next year give it negative current and forward price-to-earnings ratios. Looking further to other commonly used valuation metrics, AMD's enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is also quite high at 236.
The common thread should jump out here. AMD's expected lack of profitability this year and next year doesn't inspire a lot of faith that the company can sustain a $6.8 billion market capitalization. To be sure, a large portion of AMD's current-year losses stem from the $340 million charge related to its amended chip-fabrication deal with its former manufacturing arm GlobalFoundries. However, this one-time charge doesn't affect AMD's profit outlook for next year. Thus, its continued estimated losses make me question whether investors are willing to wait until 2018 for profits to appear.
To be sure, AMD has done a great job tapping into the newfound demand for gaming-quality graphics chips. However, NVIDIA's ability to move down-market in that area adds a clear element of risk to AMD's ability to continue to steal market share. What's more, as console gaming platforms seem likely to vie with PCs as virtual reality gaming platforms, it seems possible that AMD's two core revenue growth catalysts could find themselves in direct competition in the years to come.
The overall point is that AMD's stock rebound has certainly been justified -- to a degree. However, given the company's plausible lack of near-term profits and its positive but evolving competitive position, a continued rise in AMD stock seems unlikely in my estimation.

Shares of graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) surged on Friday following the release of its third-quarter report, which blew past expectations. Both revenue and earnings came in well ahead of estimates, driven by the strength of its Pascal graphics cards, and the company's guidance was far better than expected. At 10:45 a.m. EST, the stock was up about 24%.
NVIDIA reported third-quarter revenue of $2 billion, up 54% year over year and a whopping $310 million higher than the average analyst estimate. The main driver was NVIDIA's gaming products, which generated $1.24 billion of revenue, up 63% year over year. NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards have been a major success, aided by a lack of competition at the high end of the market from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
NVIDIA's other segments produced growth as well. Professional product revenue grew 9% to $207 million, data center revenue grew 193% to $240 million, and automotive revenue grew 61% to $127 million. Gaming still accounts for the bulk of NVIDIA's sales, but the company is rapidly diversifying beyond that market.
Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.94, up 104% year over year and $0.37 higher than analyst expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin improved by 270 basis points year over year to 59.2%, while non-GAAP operating margin jumped to 35.3%, up from 23.6% during the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased by just 11% year over year, facilitating the massive earnings increase.
NVIDIA's fourth-quarter guidance didn't disappoint. The company expects to produce revenue of $2.1 billion, plus or minus 2%, with a non-GAAP gross margin of 59.2%. Analysts were expecting revenue guidance of just $1.69 billion. The company also announced that it plans to return a total of $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends in fiscal 2017, and $1.25 billion in fiscal 2018.
Despite AMD launching its anticipated Polaris graphics cards at the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA's gaming business is only getting stronger. The GTX 1060 launched in July, followed by the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti in October. Both challenge AMD in the mainstream portion of the market, and by all indications they have been successful for NVIDIA.
The data center segment nearly tripled its revenue, astonishing performance that suggests that NVIDIA's intense focus on deep learning is paying off. The auto segment also posted impressive results, with the business buoyed by recent news that Tesla had adopted NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 platform for all of its cars going forward.
NVIDIA's results continue to impress, and the company showed no signs of slowing down during the third quarter. A couple of post-earnings analyst upgrades have pushed price targets for the stock up to $95, and investors are doing their part driving the stock price higher.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a non-GAAP profit during its latest quarter, a vast improvement over recent quarters. But on a GAAP basis, the company posted a massive $406 million net loss. The discrepancy was mostly due to a $340 million charge that AMD took related to its wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries. The GAAP numbers include this charge; the non-GAAP numbers don't.
Companies report non-GAAP figures in an effort to give investors a number that better reflects their true performance. Unfortunately, many companies back out recurring costs like stock-based compensation, a practice which I strongly disagree with. Backing out one-time costs, like the wafer supply agreement charge, is often a reasonable thing to do. But when a pattern of ""one-time"" costs begins to emerge, investors should think twice about accepting those non-GAAP numbers.
That $340 million wafer supply agreement charge was the biggest one-time cost that AMD has reported in the past few years, but it certainly wasn't the only one. Between the beginning of 2014 and the third quarter of this year, AMD has taken 15 different one-time charges, with a whopping total of nearly $1.1 billion.

All of these charges, with the exception of the inventory writedown in 2015, were backed out by AMD when calculating non-GAAP earnings. Many companies take restructuring charges, but when restructuring becomes a recurring theme, I don't think it's reasonable to ignore those costs any longer.
Even that big wafer supply agreement charge isn't truly a one-time cost. AMD took a massive $703 million charge related to that agreement back in 2012. One reason for the charge: ""GLOBALFOUNDRIES waived the exclusivity arrangement for AMD to manufacture certain 28nm APU products at GLOBALFOUNDRIES for a specified period.""
What was the reason for the $340 million charge during the third-quarter of this year? The new agreement ""Provides AMD with the flexibility to manufacture certain products with another wafer foundry."" That sounds awfully familiar.
Many companies take all sorts of charges and back them out of their non-GAAP figures. AMD is certainly not unique in that sense. But when these charges seem to repeat themselves, it becomes difficult to argue that they're truly ""one-time.""
None of this says anything about AMD's ongoing turnaround efforts. The company has made clear progress, with both of its segments growing sales during the third quarter. Its Polaris graphics cards have put the company in a far better position than it was in last year, although NVIDIA remains dominant with its Pascal graphics cards. The semi-custom business got a boost with new, high-end game consoles that launched this year. And Zen is coming in 2017.
But as we go forward, remember that AMD has a long history of one-time charges. Its non-GAAP numbers must be taken without a grain of salt.

            ","With the market hovering near all-time highs, it might seem tough to find stocks with significant upside potential from current levels. But for investors willing to take a risk on more beaten-down or volatile plays, these three picks might double within the next few years -- Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).

Image source: Getty Images.
Twilio's cloud platform links popular apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Uber, and Airbnb to users' phone numbers. Its service lets users add contacts, send text messages, or call each other via their phone numbers within an app. That feature is tough for a developer to create and scale up on its own, so it's generally more convenient, economical, and reliable to subscribe to Twilio's platform.
Growing demand for Twilio's services boosted its revenue by 62% annually to $71.5 million last quarter, and its active customer accounts grew 45%. Twilio expects its revenue to rise 61%-62% for the full year, compared to 88% growth in 2015. Twilio still isn't profitable, but its non-GAAP net losses narrowed last quarter.
Twilio's core business looks promising, but it's been on a roller-coaster ride since its IPO in late June. It initially surged from its IPO price of $15 to nearly $70 by late September, inflating its price-to-sales ratio into the high 20s. Twilio then announced a secondary offering in early October, triggering a massive sell-off that knocked the stock back to the low $30s. But now that Twilio's P/S ratio has cooled off to 12, and short interest has surged to 50% as of Oct. 25, I believe that the stock is poised for a rebound.
Cybersecurity company CyberArk is the market leader in the PAM (privileged account management) market. Its platform protects companies from internal threats, like disgruntled employees, by locking down compromised computers before they impact the rest of the network. 

Image source: Getty Images.
CyberArk doesn't face much competition in this market because most cybersecurity companies focus on external threats with next-gen firewalls and threat detection systems. Yet a report from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Security last September found that 43% of data breaches were actually caused internally. 
As a result, rising demand for CyberArk's services boosted its revenue 37% annually to $55 million last quarter. CyberArk expects its revenue to rise 33%-34% for the full year, compared to 56% growth in 2015. Unlike many other cybersecurity firms, CyberArk is profitable on a GAAP basis. Its GAAP net income rose 4% to $7.1 million last quarter, while its non-GAAP net income improved 28% to $11.8 million.
Despite those strong numbers, CyberArk stock has stayed almost flat over the past 12 months due to concerns about its slowing sales growth, weak enterprise spending, and its high valuations (8.5 times sales and 62 times earnings). However, the rising number of data breaches worldwide could continue boosting CyberArk's top and bottom line growth for years to come. With an enterprise value of just $1.2 billion, CyberArk could also be a lucrative takeover target for larger cybersecurity, networking, or IT companies.
It might seem greedy to believe that chipmaker AMD, which already rallied 200% over the past 12 months, could still double from its current price. However, the stock remains fairly cheap with a P/S ratio of 1.4, which is much lower than Intel's ratio of 2.7 and Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) ratio of 6.7.
AMD stock has been rising on the growth of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which is mainly supported by its sales of custom SoCs for the PS4 and Xbox One. New versions of these consoles -- like the PS4 Pro, PS4 Slim, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio -- will require even more AMD chips. AMD has also been pushing hard against Nvidia in the ""VR ready"" GPU market with low-cost GPUs like the RX 480. Looking ahead, AMD's next-gen Vega GPUs and Zen CPUs could help it narrow its performance gaps with Nvidia's high-end GPUs and Intel's high-end CPUs.
Back in July, AMD posted 9% annual sales growth for its second quarter, marking its first year-over-year sales growth in two years. It followed that up with 23% sales growth in the third quarter, and is on track to grow its annual sales by 6% for 2016 -- compared to a 28% decline in 2015. AMD remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis, but it squeezed out a non-GAAP profit of $27 million last quarter. If that bottom line improvement continues, AMD's price might head back to the double-digits within the next few years.
Twilio, CyberArk, and AMD all have upside potential, but they are also fairly risky plays which shouldn't be considered core investments. I personally own both Twilio and CyberArk, but only as minor positions designated as ""higher risk, higher reward"" plays. These stocks could certainly double over the long term, but I also wouldn't be surprised if they were cut in half during a market downturn.

During the third quarter, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported strong sales of its new Polaris graphics cards. The company's computing and graphics segment, which includes GPUs as well as CPUs, grew revenue by 11% year over year, with the launch of Polaris more than offsetting weak demand for desktop processors. The segment still posted a loss, but a far smaller one compared to the same period last year.
Market leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be reporting its third-quarter results on Nov. 10. The company's guidance calls for substantial revenue growth, no doubt driven by strong sales of its Pascal GPUs. With both AMD's Polaris and NVIDIA's Pascal driving growth, it can be difficult to parse whether AMD is gaining any ground on its rival. One piece of data suggests that NVIDIA's dominant position remains intact.
Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform operated by Valve, collects data on the hardware configurations of its users and provides monthly updates as part of its hardware and software survey. I've written before about NVIDIA's dominance on Steam. The GTX 970, launched in 2014, remains the most widely used graphics card on the platform, with the GTX 960 and GTX 750 Ti rounding out the top three. AMD fails to crack the top 15.
The data from Steam aren't perfect. Participation in the survey is optional, and it's unclear whether that creates any sort of bias. The data don't tell us much about the PC market as a whole. But I think it's reasonably representative of the PC gaming market, thus giving us a window into trends occurring in the industry.
The only Polaris graphics card that shows up on the list is the RX 480, the highest-end card that AMD has launched so far. The RX 470 and RX 460 have yet to show up on the list, but they were launched more than a month later.
In October, the RX 480 accounted for 0.28% of graphics cards in use on the Steam platform, according to the survey data. The card faced availability issues early on, which may have depressed the numbers a bit. But NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards were also in short supply upon launch.
NVIDIA launched its GTX 1080 and GTX 1070, both far more expensive than the RX 480, about a month earlier than AMD's debut Polaris card. The GTX 1060 came in late July, a few weeks after the RX 480 became available. All three cards have easily surpassed the RX 480 on Steam.

GTX 1060
1.03%
GTX 1080
0.75%
RX 480
0.28%
Data source: Steam hardware and software survey.
The conclusion I draw from these data is that Polaris has not been a runaway success for AMD. These new cards are driving year-over-year growth, but it's important to remember that AMD's graphics market share was near its lowest point during the third quarter of 2015. It would have been shocking if Polaris wasn't producing significant year-over-year revenue growth, given the comparison.
There's no question that AMD's lineup of graphics cards is more competitive today than it was a year ago. But, at least on Steam, NVIDIA's grip on the market doesn't seem to be loosening. AMD will launch higher-end Vega graphics cards next year, and that may help the company win back share at the high end. But for now, NVIDIA remains king.

With their stocks soaring in the last year, it's been an incredible time to be a shareholder of semiconductor stocks NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).

AMD data by YCharts.
To see which stock looks like the better buy going forward, though, let's examine AMD's and NVIDIA's stock histories, the financial trends underpinning their recent rises, and the long-term outlook for their respective businesses to see which stock remains the better buy today.
WIth the stock tripling in the past 12 months alone, investors clearly see a major opportunity ahead for AMD. As longtime second fiddles to rival Intel in the PC CPU market, AMD and NVIDIA have benefited mightily from a resurgence of interest in graphics-intensive computing in a number of markets. Specifically, AMD's move deeper into semi-custom graphics chips that ship into video game consoles has proven to be a boon for the company of late. Case in point: Revenue from its semi-custom chip segment increased about 5% in AMD's most recent quarter. However, I'm not so sure the rally in AMD stock can sustain itself.
Looking to the bigger picture, several red flags emerge in AMD's business model that could conceivably reverse the recent GPU market share gains it has achieved. For starters, there is increasing competition in graphics chips, since NVIDIA -- traditionally the high-end vendor in the GPU market -- recently launched its GeForce GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti chips. These chips target the lower-cost segment of the market where AMD has recently been able to eke out some market share gain. The company's balance sheet isn't particularly impressive, either. AMD carries about $3.3 billion in total assets, compared to $2 billion in long-term debt. This isn't an acute issue, but interest payments on its debts do create one more headwind for a company still struggling to switch to profitability -- which is by no means the case for NVIDIA .

Image source: NVIDIA.
NVIDIA shares many of the same opportunities as AMD, but the company's long-held status as the premier graphics processing chipmaker has allowed it to branch this specialization into a number of emerging growth areas -- and to do so better than its rival.
The rise of competitive gaming is one area that few -- myself included -- expected to grow into a major business, but NVIDIA's wares have become the leading chip for the professional gaming industry, which favors the computing power of PCs over consoles. Self-driving cars also serve as another emerging source of significant opportunity for NVIDIA, since they use many external sensors to gauge their surroundings and behave accordingly. Strange as it may sound, discerning in real time whether the object next to it is a person riding a bike or a car requires a tremendous amount of graphics processing power, for which NVIDIA has also created a series of turnkey solutions. NVIDIA enjoys a similar opportunity in big data and AI visualization, but by now, hopefully you see a trend. The general direction of computing and technology is toward more graphics-intensive activities, and NVIDIA stands to be the beneficiary of this movement, perhaps more than any other company.
Equally compelling is the fact that NVIDIA is also profitable and enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its 47 times P/E ratio makes the company about twice as expensive as the broader market. However, given the generational nature of some of NVIDIA's opportunities, the company could easily outgrow that valuation for investors willing to hold its stock over the long term.
Hopefully, the likely winner in this scenario is abundantly clear. NVIDIA has the better business model, technological leadership, and a stronger balance sheet, and it has already achieved profitability. What's more, NVIDIA's move into some areas that have driven AMD's recent success threatens to derail AMD's growth story before the company can flip to profitability.
Here, the conclusion is obvious. NVIDIA is the better semiconductor stock for investors to buy today.

In an effort to win back lost market share, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) aimed its Polaris graphics architecture at the mainstream portion of the market. The RX 480, priced at $199 or $239 depending on the memory configuration, launched at the end of June. The RX 470, priced at $179, launched in early August, as did two variants of the RX 460, priced at $109 and $139. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) went in the opposite direction with its Pascal GPUs, targeting the high-end first.
This strategy made a lot of sense for AMD, which had seen its unit share of the graphics card market bottom out below 20% last year. The company made some progress on the market share front prior to Polaris' launch, but these new graphics cards will ultimately determine whether AMD will be able to claw its way back to a strong No. 2 position in the industry.
AMD's plan hit a bit of a snag in October. NVIDIA launched the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti on Oct. 25, priced at $109 and $139, respectively. This marked Pascal's maiden voyage into the low-end of the market, providing competition to AMD's cheaper Polaris graphics cards.
In response to the launch, AMD slashed the official prices on the RX 460 and RX 470. The RX 460 now starts at $100, while the RX 470 goes for $170. It will take time for actual prices at retailers to reflect these changes, but it's clear from these price cuts that NVIDIA was more aggressive than AMD was expecting.
According to Tom's Hardware, the GTX 1050 soundly beats the RX 460 in nearly every benchmark, often by a significant margin. To AMD's credit, the performance gap is much smaller in games using either DirectX 12 or Vulkan. But in older games, NVIDIA's card dominates. Given that the GTX 1050 launched at the same price as the RX 460, it makes sense that AMD was quick to lower the price. At the same price, NVIDIA's offering is the clear winner.
The GTX 1050 Ti isn't nearly as disruptive, filling the gap between the GTX 1050 and AMD's RX 470. But the RX 470 has issues of its own. PC World, in its review, called the RX 470 ""a great graphics card with a terrible price."" At a launch price of $179, the gap between the RX 470 and the higher-end RX 480 simply wasn't big enough. The $10 price cut makes the RX 470 a bit more compelling, so we'll have to wait and see if the new price point drives demand.
AMD's reign as the undisputed leader in the mainstream portion of the graphics card market only lasted a few months. NVIDIA's new Pascal cards, particularly the GTX 1050, are sure to make AMD's goal of winning back market share significantly more difficult. This isn't the first time that NVIDIA has forced AMD's hand on prices. Back in late 2014, NVIDIA's launch of the GTX 970 and GTX 980 prompted major price cuts on AMD's flagship graphics cards. That launch marked the beginning of NVIDIA's robust market share gains over the next year.
Beyond the mainstream market, AMD won't be launching higher-end Vega graphics cards until the first half of next year. NVIDIA's high-end Pascal graphics cards face no real competition at the moment, and it could be another six months before AMD finally provides an alternative.
Reactive price cuts, particularly so soon after launch, are never a good sign. NVIDIA is going after the $109 price point aggressively, perhaps more aggressively than AMD was expecting. The takeaway: AMD executing its mainstream strategy and winning back considerable market share from NVIDIA will be easier said than done.

            ","Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) recently revealed the Switch, a hybrid gaming console that seamlessly transforms from a handheld into a home console via a dock and detachable controllers. 
The design aesthetic is similar to the Wii U's, except that the Wii U's handheld mode only works when the touchscreen controller is in range of the base console. The Switch is also similar to Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Shield tablet, which transforms into a home console when connected to a TV and a controller.

Image source: Nintendo.
Therefore, the revelation that the Switch will be powered by Nvidia's Tegra CPUs instead of AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) APUs wasn't all that surprising. But that shift also indicates that AMD's iron grip on the console market might be weakening. 
AMD's APUs (which combine CPUs and GPUs) currently power Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One, and its GPUs powered the Wii and Wii U. If Nintendo's use of Tegra chips indicates a fresh start for Nvidia in the gaming console market, should AMD start worrying?
Nintendo is often considered an underdog in the console market. After all, it's only sold 13.3 million Wii Us worldwide, compared to 22.3 million Xbox Ones and 43.4 million PS4s. The Wii U's smaller audience and weaker hardware specs also caused many publishers to shun the console during cross-platform releases. 
However, many critics overlook the fact that Nintendo's 3DS handheld is actually the best-selling console of the current generation, with 59.3 million units sold worldwide. Sony, by comparison, has only sold 14.3 million PS Vitas. 
With the Wii U, Nintendo was trying to leverage its strong position in handhelds to expand into living rooms. But since the Wii U controller couldn't work as a stand-alone handheld, it was never clear exactly who the console was designed for. The Switch, however, sends a clear message that it's a console that can be played anywhere. 
Nintendo executives likely noticed that Nvidia was using its Shield devices to showcase the power of its Tegra SoCs, which were marginalized in the mainstream mobile market by Qualcomm. Like Nintendo, Nvidia was pursuing a ""gaming anywhere"" strategy.
For example, the Shield tablet plays regular Android games on Google Play and Shield-optimized games through Nvidia's Shield Hub, and streams PC games over home networks. In ""console mode"", the device attaches to a TV and a controller. 
Like the Shield tablet, the Switch's ""brain"" is really just a powerful gaming tablet. Since AMD's tablet-based Micro Series APUs aren't as well-known as Nvidia's Tegra SoCs, it made sense for Nintendo to use Nvidia's chips. Jefferies & Co. analyst Mark Lipacis recently estimated that the Switch could add up to $320 million in annual revenues to Nvidia's top line.

The Shield tablet K1. Image source: Nvidia.
AMD depends heavily on sales of semi-custom APUs for the PS4 and Xbox One to support its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which generated over 60% of its sales last quarter. During that quarter, EESC sales rose 31% annually on robust sales of gaming consoles. 
Sony and Microsoft's upgrades for their consoles -- like the PS4 Slim, PS4 Pro, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio -- are expected to keep the APU orders flowing. Therefore, the impact of Nintendo's decision to use Nvidia's chips might seem minimal. 
However, investors should remember that AMD didn't always dominate the console market -- the original Xbox was powered by an Nvidia GPU, and the PS3 used a proprietary GPU co-developed by Nvidia and Sony. Therefore, if the Switch sparks a new form factor revolution, Sony or Microsoft might consider launching new hybrid devices also powered by Nvidia's Tegra chips.
In addition to moving in on AMD's turf in consoles, Nvidia has been aggressively attacking AMD with budget graphics cards like the 3GB GTX 1060 ($200), the 4GB GTX 1050 Ti ($139), and the 2GB GTX 1050 ($109). Those new cards recently forced AMD to reduce the prices of its 4GB RX 470 to $170, and its RX 460 to $110. 
Whereas AMD could previously generate revenue from niches like gaming console APUs and low-end GPUs, Nvidia seems intent on pushing its only meaningful rival in GPUs out of the market. It's unclear if Nintendo will give Nvidia the momentum it needs to make an impression on Sony and Microsoft again, but AMD investors should pay close attention to the Switch's arrival this holiday season.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) beat analyst estimates on all fronts when it reported its third-quarter results on Oct. 20. The company posted double-digit revenue growth along with a non-GAAP (adjusted) net profit, both signs that AMD's turnaround is making tangible progress.
During AMD's earnings conference call, CEO Lisa Su and CFO Devinder Kumar provided some additional commentary on the company's performance. Here are four key quotes, taken from the transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.
AMD's first Polaris graphics cards launched at the very end of the second quarter, so the company's third-quarter results offer the first indication of how the new products are faring. According to Su, Polaris has been a success so far:
In graphics, we had a very strong quarter, with discrete GPU revenue and unit shipments growing by double-digit percentages sequentially and year-over-year. The launch of our expanded family of Polaris desktop GPUs, and our first full quarter of RX 480 sales drove our highest quarterly channel GPU revenue and ASP since early 2014. Radeon RX GPUs now account for more than 50% of our channel GPU revenue.
It was toward the end of 2014 when AMD's graphics business went off the rails. A lack of competitive products, particularly at the high end of the market, led rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) to scoop up share, relegating AMD to also-ran status. AMD has been clawing back market share for the past few quarters, and it now seems that Polaris will help continue that trend.
AMD's focus on the mainstream graphics market with Polaris has allowed NVIDIA to essentially run away with the high-end portion of the market. For AMD, winning back market share has been the No. 1 priority, and temporarily ceding the high end is likely a sacrifice worth making. Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end graphics architecture, is set to launch sometime next year.
One of the major barriers to profitability for AMD has been its balance sheet, which featured more than $2 billion of debt at the end of the second quarter. This translates into annual interest payments of roughly $160 million.
During the third quarter, AMD took advantage of its soaring stock price to raise cash. As Kumar explained, the result is a less precarious financial situation:
Debt as of the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter, due to our significant debt reduction effort. During the third quarter, we raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock, which includes the exercise of an underwriter's option to purchase 15% or $90 million of additional common stock, and the issuance of $700 million in 2 1/8% convertible notes due in 2026.
AMD expects its annualized interest expense to be reduced by approximately $55 million beginning in the fourth quarter. Higher revenue will ultimately be required to bring AMD back into the black on a GAAP basis, but lower interest payments certainly help the cause.
AMD slashed spending on research and development over the past few years as it grappled with collapsing revenue. In 2015, AMD spent just $947 million on R&D, down from $1.45 billion in 2011. NVIDIA, which focuses solely on graphics products, now outspends AMD in this area.
Su sees this trend potentially reversing going forward:
So I think we have an opportunity to invest a bit more in R&D as our revenue grows, but we're still going to be very prudent with how we do that. I think the key metric there in terms of being net income profitable this quarter, ensuring that we get free cash flow positive from operations for the full year, those are all important metrics for us, and we're going to continue to manage very diligently.
AMD faces a difficult challenge. The company needs to show that it can return to profitability, but it also needs to invest in the future to ensure that it doesn't fall behind. Cutting R&D spending can boost short-term profits, but it can also wreak havoc on the company's long-term competitiveness. Finding the right balance will not be an easy task for management in the coming years.
While AMD's computing and graphics segment still posted an operating loss during the third quarter, the semi-custom segment grew both revenue and profit. Beyond AMD's initial game console wins, the company has announced three additional semi-custom design wins, and some of those wins are now contributing revenue. Unfortunately, Su had nothing new to announce on the semi-custom front:
I will say that we previously announced three, and that's the number that we'll talk about today. Two of them are now known, and they're both in the game console area, one is outside of game console. I will say that we have some very good active discussions on future products and applications, and we'll update more as we get further along.
With two of the new semi-custom design wins being game consoles, the company remains dependent on a market that tends to peak a few years after a new console is launched and then decline until the next generation begins. The semi-custom business will need to be more diversified for it to be a real long-term growth driver for the company.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been engaged in a bitter graphics card battle for years, but NVIDIA just landed a new blow to its rival.
The company debuted two new graphics cards recently -- the GeForce GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti -- based on the company's new Pascal architecture, and they sell for just $109 and $139, respectively.
NVIDIA isn't a stranger to the budget graphics card market, and these two particular cards have been rumored for a few months. But the new cards should worry AMD for two key reasons: The cards offer some of the best performance at the lowest prices, and NVIDIA is marketing them to new gamers, a group it typically doesn't focus on.
NVIDIA made it clear in a blog post that the 1050 and 1050 Ti are great for new gamers, saying, ""If you're a new gamer, these two new GPUs let you be a part of the biggest story in gaming."" NVIDIA usually tops the list for the best high-end graphics cards, but by targeting new gamers, it's also ensuring that it dominates the low-end market as well. 
The company already holds an impressive 70% of the discrete desktop GPU market, but AMD has started to make some gains over the past year.
Data source: Jon Peddie Research.
By releasing the two new graphics cards, NVIDIA updates its budget graphics cards and hopefully spurs new sales in the lower-end market. That's important for NVIDIA because the company's own average selling price (ASP) trend has tilted toward pushing ASPs higher, not lower. That's typically a good thing, but in this case, lower prices mean it can grab more of the budget card market. 
While AMD is making some market share gains on NVIDIA, it's clearly still the underdog. AMD has been able to hold onto customers primarily by offering lower-priced cards than NVIDIA, but this latest move from its rival could end up hurting AMD. 
AnandTech recently wrote that the pricing differences between NVIDIA's new graphics cards and AMD's low-end cards ""[mean] that AMD's two-month run as the sole supplier of current-generation entry-level video cards is about to come to an end.""
NVIDIA's new cards compete directly with AMD's RX 460, which starts at $109 for the 2GB version (the same as NVIDIA's 1050) and $140 for the 4GB version (the same as NVIDIA's 1050 Ti). 
But a separate AnandTech article noted that while the prices are about the same, ""In theory, Nvidia's cards should be a wee bit faster, with the 1050 Ti in particular sporting some great specs for the money.""
We'll still have to wait and see how well the new GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti sell compared to AMD's comparable cards before we know how much of an advantage this could be for NVIDIA. The 1050 Ti will begin selling October 25, and the 1050 will follow on November 8, with NVIDIA saying the cards will be available worldwide on those dates.
What will be interesting to see is if NVIDIA continues to focus on the lower-end market even as it dominates high-end cards. NVIDIA earned about 55% of its total revenue in Q2 2017 from its gaming segment, and grabbing both ends of the graphics card spectrum could help the company keep its gaming revenue up. AMD may have made some recent market share gains against NVIDIA, but these new cards prove that NVIDIA isn't willing to let its rival gain any more ground without a fight.

A plethora of analysts agree that NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) shares are deeply undervalued. Fellow chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also found on many lists of promising low-cost investment ideas.
One of these stocks is not like the other, though. Let me show you what sets NXP apart from AMD, and what kind of investor might prefer each of these chip tickers.

Data from Yahoo! Finance.
To be fair, NXP's recent revenue growth wasn't organic at all. The company merged with fellow embedded chip specialist Freescale Semiconductor in a $12 billion deal that closed last December. That combination should boost NXP's annual sales by approximately 66% by the end of 2016, though some investors might see it as the easy way to increase revenue.
By contrast, AMD pinned its second-quarter sales jump on strong demand for its graphics products and semi-custom processors. That's a clean serving of organic growth, which is a high-quality revenue booster.
But before we jump to conclusions about AMD's sales growth being much more desirable than NXP's version, let me put the two companies into a historical context:

AMD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
AMD's recent sales bump was a welcome respite from many quarters of plunging revenues. The company has been in freefall for years and is a turnaround story that never quite seems to find a happy ending. The current uptick rests chiefly on semi-custom chips that are shipped into the video game console markets. This year's surge is likely to peak in the third quarter, as the console builders put together their product reserves for the holidays.
In short, AMD has no choice but to bet the farm on gaming consoles even though mobile gaming seems constantly poised to destroy the traditional console market. Game publishers and console makers are pulling out all the stops to stem the mobile tide, but how long will that effort last?
And what are the chances that AMD finds a way to exploit the mobile hardware market before it's too late?
It sure hasn't happened yet.
Over on the NXP side, that company is betting big on the exploding market for automotive computing.
The Freescale acquisition put NXP in an unchalleneged leadership position of that fragmented sector, and the future is wrapped in chrome and leather. For now, car-related chips tend to focus on infotainment system, in-car networking, data security, and engine controls. Not that far into the future, the demand for car-specific chips will skyrocket as self-driving cars go mainstream -- and NXP is sitting pretty at this critical juncture.
Long story short, AMD is a risky turnaround bet while NXP is a tantalizingly pure play on one of the largest market trends of this decade.
Both companies have been at the receiving end of buyout rumors in recent months. Let's be generous and assume that both NXP and AMD receive serious offers. Even so, it would make sense to give NXP investors a roomy buyout premium while AMD's buyer should get a risk-related discount.
NXP is a sensible option for many investor temperaments, including value hunters, buyout gamblers, and long-term growth visionaries. Meanwhile, only the gamblers need to worry about AMD's shares. The potential rewards there are more than balanced out by heaps of market and execution risks.

With shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) near their highest level in years, it can be easy to forget that the company is still unprofitable. In 2015, AMD posted a whopping $660 million net loss, its fourth annual net loss in a row. The situation has improved this year, with AMD managing to squeeze out a non-GAAP operating profit during the second quarter. But a return to true profitability remains elusive.
What will it take for AMD to turn a profit? Revenue, and lots of it.
AMD's revenue tumbled 27.5% in 2015, driven by sluggish demand for PCs and share losses to NVIDIA in the GPU market. Through the first six months of 2016, AMD has produced $1.86 billion of revenue, down from $1.97 billion during the same period last year. Cost-cutting has helped keep operating losses in check despite the lower revenue, but increasing sales is the only path to sustainable profitability.
One thing that has acted as a barrier to profitability for AMD is its debt load. During the first six months of 2016, AMD paid $81 million in interest on about $2.2 billion of debt. In 2015, interest payments ate up 4% of revenue, meaning that the company would have needed to deliver an operating margin of 4% just to break even after interest.
The good news for AMD is that its recently announced stock and convertible note sale, which is expected to raise more than $1 billion in total, will allow the company to pay down some of its debt and reduce its annual interest obligations. The surge in the stock price this year created an opening for AMD to raise cash, and the company took full advantage. This alone won't be enough to propel the company back to profitability, but it's a good move nonetheless.
AMD expects to grow total revenue by a low-single-digit percentage this year, but that won't be enough to return the company to profitability. Over the next few years, a few things will need to go right for AMD in order for the company to bring in enough revenue to pull the bottom line back into the black.
First, AMD's semi-custom business will need to secure sufficient revenue beyond gaming consoles. Both the number of consoles sold and the amount of revenue AMD receives per console will decline as this generation matures, creating a hole that the company will need to fill. AMD has already announced three design wins -- one of which is Microsoft's Project Scorpio console -- that are expected to bring in a total of $1.5 billion over the next three to four years. That's a good start, but AMD will need to keep winning deals in order to drive meaningful growth in the long run.
Second, AMD will need to win back graphics market share from NVIDIA. The company has already launched its mainstream Polaris graphics cards, and with NVIDIA mainly focused on the high end, there's a good chance that AMD is picking up mainstream customers. How much additional revenue this will create remains unclear, though. We'll need to wait until AMD reports its third-quarter results later this month to find out.
Third, AMD's upcoming Zen CPUs, set to launch next year for PCs and servers, will need to find a way to claw back market share from Intel. As long as Zen proves competitive, AMD has a decent shot at making progress. Intel has slowed the pace at which it moves to new manufacturing processes, meaning that the manufacturing gap between Intel and AMD will be narrower than it's been in quite some time. As long as Zen doesn't fail to live up to expectations, AMD has a good chance at winning back at least some market share.
If things go right for AMD, the company could conceivably return to profitability next year or in 2018. But an important follow-up question is this: Can AMD produce enough profits to justify its soaring stock price? With a market capitalization of around $5.4 billion, AMD will likely need to sustainably produce a few hundred million dollars of profit annually to keep its stock afloat. AMD has done it before, but the good times have never lasted for more than a few years. Will this time be different? Only time will tell.

            ","The virtual reality market is growing quickly. Right now there are an estimated 43 million active virtual reality (VR) users, but that's supposed to skyrocket to 171 million by 2018, according to Statista. That growth is spurring small and large technology companies alike to focus more of their attention and technology into VR pursuits. 
Image source: Getty Images.
For investors looking to tap into the VR market Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Sony (NYSE:SNE), and InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) should certainly be on your radar. Let's take a look at what each company is doing with VR. 
Advanced Micro Devices made some huge strides in the virtual reality space last year when the company released its Radeon RX 480 graphics card, priced at just $199.
Even at that price, the graphics card can handle the most powerful VR headsets on the market -- the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive -- and gives gamers a cheap way to jump into the best VR experience around.
An ArsTechnica review of the RX 480 said that for $200 the RX 480 is the ""best graphics card you can buy.""  Unfortunately for AMD, the company's bitter rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) released it's own budget card a few months later that Ars said was ""the new best budget graphics card.""  
But that shouldn't scare off investors. AMD's card is still $50 cheaper than NVIDIA's lowest-end GTX 1060 card, and it can hold its own against NVIDIA's card for many VR games, according to ArsTechnica.
Additionally, AMD is making some gains against NVIDIA in the discrete GPU market space. NVIDIA is still the clear leader, but AMD's gains should help the company gain a bigger share of the VR component space. 
Data Source: Jon Peddie Research.  
The other huge upside to AMD is the fact that the company supplies the graphics cards inside of Sony's PlayStation 4. The company has sold more than 53 million units so far and it's one of the best VR-ready consoles on the market. Sony is making big strides in VR (which I'll talk about in a minute) and any increase in sales for PS4, and its recently released variations, could help graphics card sales for AMD as well.  
Sony's stock is currently trading at 15 times its forward earnings, which is cheaper than the tech industry's average P/E ratio of 26. And compared to another major VR company focusing on hardware, Oculus-owner Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Sony is significantly cheaper. Facebook currently has a forward P/E of about 20.
Facebook is playing the long game in VR with the Oculus Rift headset, which is priced at the high end of the market at about $500, after receiving a $100 price cut in March. Meanwhile, Sony's new PlayStation VR headset costs just $399. That gives Sony a price advantage over Facebook and some other VR headset hardware makers, but it also has another advantage. 
Tens of millions of PS4 consoles are already in consumers' homes. That makes the barrier to adopt VR technology much lower than for many PC users (which is what the Oculus Rift requires). Only 1% of computers sold this year will be VR-ready, while Sony already has 40 million console users that could potentially jump into VR right now.
InvenSense's motion sensors have been in the most popular smartphones for years, but the company is looking to the virtual reality market to spur new growth. 
InvenSense released its new ICM-20603 6-axis inertial sensor over the summer, aimed squarely at the augmented and virtual reality markets. The company says the sensor gives VR headsets tighter alignment for head-tracking motions as well as faster refresh rates, both of which are an important part of a good VR experience. 
InvenSense CEO and President, Behrooz Abdi, said on the company's fiscal Q1 2017 earnings call that, ""In the gaming and virtual reality segments, or VR, we have extended our market share with our latest 6-axis motion sensor, and are currently ramping with a game controller at a tier-1 gaming OEM.""
Abdi went on to say that IHS estimates head-mounted displays are expected to grow at a more than 50% compound annual growth rate over the next four years and that InvenSense could benefit from the need for high performance motion tracking.  
Virtual reality is expected to become a $70 billion business by 2020, according to TrendForce. And all of that growth is convincing nearly every major technology company to make at least some sort of move into the space.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has made meaningful progress this year. It launched Polaris, its line of mainstream graphics cards that aim to win back market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Various financial maneuvers, including multiple joint ventures and a stock offering, have strengthened the company's balance sheet. And a return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second quarter signaled that the worst may be over.
The second phase of AMD's comeback will begin next year. Zen, the company's upcoming CPU architecture, will launch early in the year, with PC variants coming first, followed by server variants, and finally APUs. Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end GPU, is expected to begin shipping in the first half of the year, with the goal of challenging NVIDIA in the high-end of the GPU market after years of playing second fiddle.
While AMD's turnaround seems to be picking up steam, both Zen and Vega will need to be successful for the company to reach its full potential.
Expectations are high leading up to Zen's release. AMD has promised significant performance improvements that should at the very least narrow the gap between its own products and those of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). According to AMD, Zen will boost instructions per cycle by 40% compared to the previous generation of CPUs, a major increase enabled by a host of improvements.

Image source: AMD.
Winning back share in the PC market will be the first goal. Zen will focus on the high-end of the market at launch, with AMD aiming to peel away profitable market share from Intel. With the PC market as a whole continuing to slump, going after the high-end gives the company the best chance at returning to profitability.
The server market is equally important for AMD. Intel currently dominates the market for server CPUs, with AMD's market share essentially rounding down to zero. AMD estimates that the total addressable market is around $18 billion, so even clawing back 5% of the market from Intel would significantly boost AMD's top line. Intel won't give up market share without a fight, but AMD's server business can't really get any worse.
Zen doesn't need to be better than Intel's products for AMD to win back some market share, but it does need to close the performance gap. If Zen lives up to the hype, AMD's turnaround will continue to gain momentum. If it doesn't, returning to sustainable profitability will be tough.

Image source: AMD.
While Polaris aims squarely at the mainstream portion of the graphics card market, Vega, which is expected to launch during the first half of 2017, will be AMD's re-entry into the high-end of the market. Ever since NVIDIA launched the GTX 970 and GTX 980 in late 2014, the company has dominated the market for expensive, and highly profitable, graphics cards. Vega will be AMD's attempt to appeal to the high-end gaming PC market.
NVIDIA has a head start, launching the GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 earlier this year. Higher-end variants are expected to be released in the coming months as well, including a rumored GTX 1080 Ti. NVIDIA's next-gen GPU, Volta, is unlikely to be launched earlier than the second half of 2017, but AMD's Vega will be launching into a market dominated by NVIDIA.
Vega will need to be disruptive in order to pry away high-end market share from NVIDIA. If AMD succeeds in producing a viable challenger to NVIDIA's high-end cards, the company's graphics business could become more profitable compared to a scenario where the company only succeeds in winning back mainstream market share.
For AMD, 2016 was important, but 2017 will be a critical year as well. The fate of AMD's nascent turnaround will be determined by the success of Zen and Vega.

Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) watched helplessly as its unit share of the discrete graphics card market was cut in half. Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) scored a coup with its 900 series of graphics cards, particularly the GTX 970, which remains to this day the most widely owned graphics card among Steam users. AMD's market share bottomed out during the second quarter of 2015, at just 18%.
The company has been slowly clawing its way back over the past year, picking up a few points of market share here and there. AMD's comeback accelerated in the second quarter of this year, with the company gaining roughly 7 percentage points of market share compared to the first quarter, and nearly 12 percentage points year over year.

Image source: Jon Peddie Research.
This gain in market share is good news for AMD, but it comes with caveats. The second quarter was seasonally weak, with total discrete graphics card shipments tumbling 20.8% compared to the first quarter, according to Jon Peddie Research. Whether market share gains in a weak quarter will stick around during the third and fourth quarters remains to be seen. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, AMD's market share peaked during the second quarter and declined during the third quarter.
Another issue is the timing of new product launches. NVIDIA's high-end GTX 1080 became available at the end of May, and the GTX 1070 became available in the beginning of June. The GTX 1060 wasn't launched until the end of July, with a $200 variant only becoming available in August. Meanwhile, AMD's $200 RX 480 launched in the last days of the second quarter, with the lower-end RX 470 and 460 launching in August.
The second-quarter data, then, doesn't tell us much about how AMD's new Polaris graphics cards are faring. Despite losing market share, NVIDIA posted solid second-quarter results. The company's gaming segment grew revenue by 18% year over year, driven by the high-end Pascal cards. AMD winning market share during the second quarter may have been driven more by NVIDIA's focus on the high end, leaving the mainstream to AMD, than anything else.
As it stands today, AMD's Polaris graphics cards target the $200-and-below segment, while NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards target the $200-and-above segment. Eventually, NVIDIA will launch lower-end products, and AMD will launch higher-end products, but at the moment, the two companies' newest graphics cards are only directly competing at the $200 price point. This should help AMD win mainstream market share during the third quarter, at the expense of ceding the lucrative high-end portion of the market to NVIDIA.
Rumors point to NVIDIA launching two low-end cards, the GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti, as early as next month. Nothing has been confirmed at this point, but the cards are expected to target the $119 and $149 price points, respectively, putting them in direct competition with AMD's RX 460 and RX 470. Depending on how aggressive NVIDIA is with these new cards, AMD's edge in the mainstream portion of the market may not last too much longer.
AMD's market share gains during the second quarter are certainly a positive for the company, but they need to be considered in context. We won't know how Polaris has truly fared until results from the third quarter are released, and the imminent launch of low-end cards from NVIDIA could make it tougher for AMD to hold onto any market share gains in the fourth quarter and beyond. Where the market for discrete graphics cards ultimately settles, whether it's the old 60-40 split in NVIDIA's favor, or something else entirely, is still a big unknown.

Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is popular again -- and it has Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to thank for it.
By now you've all heard about Intel's unexpected increase in its guidance for the current quarter. What you may not have noticed, however, is the effect that this guidance tweak is having on the stock of its fiercest rival, AMD.
So far, since Intel 's new guidance came out, no fewer than three analysts have revised their opinion of AMD stock in just two days. Craig-Hallum upgraded AMD stock to buy yesterday. Shortly after that, Bernstein upgraded AMD shares from underperform to market perform. And just now, says TheFly.com, Susquehanna Securities is jumping on the bandwagon (albeit tentatively), and initiating coverage of AMD stock with a neutral rating.
So what's all the fuss about? Here are three things you need to know.
All of a sudden, semiconductor stocks are looking red hot. Image source: Getty Images.
Let's begin with the what of what's happening, before addressing the why. Yesterday, Craig-Hallum announced its buy rating on AMD stock. This was quickly followed by two somewhat more cautious ratings: from Bernstein, which now rates AMD market perform (i.e., neutral) and estimates the stock's value at $5 per share; and from Susquehanna -- likewise neutral, but with a $6.50 price target.
Currently, AMD stock is selling for just over $6 a share, implying no more than 5% upside from Susquehanna's estimate -- and still significant downside risk from Bernstein.
TheFly.com reports that Craig-Hallum based its upgrade on new ""Q3 guidance on PC strength"" from Intel. Based on this guidance, Craig-Hallum argues there is ""solid demand and a healthy pricing environment in both HDD and NAND,"" and that this will prove a positive for AMD stock.
Intel raised its previous guidance for fiscal third-quarter revenue by 5% last week, to $15.6 billion. The company's new guidance calls for more than a $1 billion increase in sales from Q3 of last year -- 7% year-over-year growth. Additionally, Intel hiked its gross margin expectation by 2%, to 62%, indicating that not only are PC chip sales coming in hotter than expected -- but they're more profitable as well.
This implies there is some measure of pricing power in the sector, which could benefit not just Intel stock, but AMD stock as well.
Perhaps the most curious thing about all of the above, though, is this: Since Intel raised its guidance, investors have increased the amount of money they're willing to pay for a share of Intel stock by only 1.4%, while AMD stock is up twice as much -- 3%.
That's a big disparity, and a strange one: The company that confirmed the good news is getting less of a lift from it than is its rival, which investors are only guessing might benefit from the good news. Does it really make sense, though, for investors to favor AMD stock over Intel?
I'd argue not.
Intel stock costs 18 times today, pays a 2.9% dividend yield, but is pegged for only 10% long-term earnings growth on Wall Street. That already looks kind of expensive, which helps to explain why Intel stock itself didn't get a very big lift from its improved guidance. (Also, as my fellow Fool Anders Bylund pointed out last week, Intel stock had already gained 25% over the past year, so there may not have been much more room to grow.)
AMD, on the other hand, has no profits to speak of. AMD pays no dividend and, judging from the analyst estimates posted on Yahoo! Finance, it's expected by most people on Wall Street to post ever greater losses over the next five years, with no improvement in sight.
So what's the upshot for investors today? Intel's guidance offers some faint hope that analysts' worst fears over AMD may not come to pass. Maybe, if PC chip sales are growing faster than expected, and more profitably, AMD will find a way to lose less money this quarter, and this year, than previously feared. But overall, the big picture remains unchanged:
Until AMD finds a way to actually earn a profit, the stock still isn't worth buying.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is certainly an alluring company right now. Its shares have gained more than 100% year-to-date, with much of the bullish sentiment riding on the growing popularity and opportunity behind virtual reality.
To help put the recent stock run in perspective -- and to point out some potential pitfalls at the company -- let's take a look at three charts that paint a fuller picture of AMD and the state of its business.
Longtime AMD shareholders will know that the company's revenue has been anything but encouraging over the past few years. Since 2014, the top line has declined by about 39% from its high.
Data by YCharts.
The main reason for the decline came from slowing sales of AMD's PC processors, particularly in notebooks. PC chips are among the company's biggest revenue drivers, and a slowdown in the PC market over the past few years has hurt AMD tremendously.
Despite the bad times, the company is starting to see revenue growth return, thanks to increased demand for chips and a new licensing deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology. The latter adds about $52 million to AMD's revenue this year, while the former should help the company's long-term prospects.
AMD certainly isn't out of the woods yet, and investors will need to see the company deliver on promising new chips (like its upcoming Zen processor for servers) and new GPUs to see if the recent rebound is sustainable. 
A couple of years ago, the company highlighted a few key areas that it would pursue in order to turn around its business. One of those areas of focus is what the company calls immersive platforms, which include PC components and the growing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) markets. 
The total addressable market for immersive platforms is $20 billion, according to the company, and much of that will come from the AR and VR segments. 
AMD CTO Mark Papermaster highlighted the company's focus on boosting VR adoption rates in a recent interview with TechRadar, saying:
At AMD, we frankly aim to directly impact that adoption rate. That's why, for instance, we brought that $200 price point for the RX 480. That broke the paradigm -- that is a VR-ready graphics card. You can have a wonderful VR experience, 90 frames per second, very low latency with that graphics card.
The graph below shows exactly why AMD is pinning some of its future revenue prospects on the AR and VR markets -- because they'll be worth potentially $150 billion by 2020.

AR and VR certainly aren't the only markets that AMD is focusing on, of course, but with immersive platforms marked as one of the top three focuses for the company over the next few years, it's clear the company is expecting its GPUs to be a major part of its growth story.
It's hard to write an article showing some of the most important AMD charts without including the company's massive bull run this year. The stock has already more than doubled in 2016, with a nearly 220% gain over the past 12 months.

Management and shareholders hope that the upcoming Zen release could steal some of the $18 billion server market away from rival Intel. The company says it has already secured several design wins with original equipment manufacturers and that it will officially launch the chip in the first half of 2017.
AMD certainly has a lot going for it in the GPU, VR, and PC markets -- management is wisely pursuing new areas of growth and re-entering markets where they believe the company can succeed (like server processors).
But without stable revenue, the incredible share price gains would make me hesitant to invest in the company right now. It definitely appears that there are brighter days ahead for the company, but investors should be careful not to overestimate the success AMD will enjoy based on such early efforts with little to show for them.

With shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soaring this year, driven by hype surrounding its Polaris GPUs and upcoming Zen CPUs, it's not surprising that the company is taking advantage of its elevated stock price. AMD plans to sell approximately $600 million worth of new shares for $7.51 a pop, a price that's about four times higher than where the stock price stood at this time last year. Another $450 million will be raised by selling convertible notes, with the cumulative proceeds going toward paying down AMD's existing debt.

AMD data by YCharts.
Investors aren't thrilled about the dilution that this stock sale will cause, knocking down the stock for two days in a row following the announcement. But for AMD, it's a great move that will shore up its balance sheet ahead of the launch of Zen next year.
AMD expects to sell about 79.9 million shares, assuming an offer price of $7.51 per share. The net proceeds of the deal will be approximately $581.3 million, or as much as $668.6 million if the underwriters exercise their options to buy an additional $90 million worth of stock. AMD's diluted share count stood at 821 million at the end of the second quarter, meaning that this offering will increase the share count by nearly 10%.
AMD is also selling $450 million worth of convertible senior notes due in 2026, with the company expecting net proceeds of $439.1 million, or as much as $505.1 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option. The interest rate and conversion price have yet to be determined according to the SEC filing detailing the offering. These convertible notes will cause additional dilution.
In total, AMD could raise as much as $1.17 billion through these two offerings. The company plans to use this money to pay down existing debt, including $226 million that AMD borrowed under a revolving credit line, and up to $1.02 billion worth of outstanding senior notes due in 2020. Those notes yield 7.75%, giving AMD the opportunity to reduce its annual interest expense.
Until the offerings are complete and more details are known, the exact impact on AMD's interest obligations can't be determined. Over the past 12 months, AMD paid $161 million in interest on about $2.24 billion of debt. That interest represents a barrier to AMD returning to profitability, and reducing it by potentially tens of millions of dollars annually will reduce the time it takes for the company to put an end to its long string of losses.
Because AMD plans to use the proceeds for paying down debt, the company's cash balance shouldn't be affected all that much. However, a deal earlier this year that resulted in AMD selling its assembly and test facilities into a joint venture raised about $320 million, boosting the company's cash balance to a comfortable level. At the end of the second quarter, AMD was sitting on nearly $1 billion of cash thanks to that deal.
For investors, the dilution caused by the stock and convertible offering will reduce per-share earnings in the event that AMD returns to profitability. But the reduction in interest payments will boost profits, so it's not all bad news. Had AMD decided to sell additional shares a year ago, when the stock was in the doldrums, the dilution would have been much worse.
With the first Polaris graphics cards already launched, AMD's third-quarter report should shed some light on how the graphics business has fared. Zen won't arrive in volume until next year, so investors still have a while to wait before it's clear whether AMD's plan to effectively compete with Intel comes to fruition.
By selling stock now, when the hype surrounding these products is at a fever pitch, AMD is maximizing its ability to reduce its debt load. In the long run, despite the dilution, that's a good thing for investors.

The stock market treaded water on Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 both posting minimal losses even as the Nasdaq Composite inched higher to set a new all-time record high. Investors seemed unwilling to take major positions in either direction before knowing how the Federal Reserve and other global central banks are likely to respond to current economic conditions, and that uncertainty offset solid gains in the energy markets that sent crude oil prices up more than $1 to climb above $46 per barrel. Several stocks held the market back from gains, and among the poorest performers were Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM), HD Supply (NASDAQ:HDS), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Whole Foods Market lost 5% in the wake of a warning from competing natural foods specialist Sprouts Farmers Market. Whole Foods' smaller rival updated its guidance, pointing to ongoing deflation and increased pressure on the promotional front in pulling back on its outlook for the rest of the year. With expectations for flat comparable-store sales growth for the third quarter, Sprouts said that it expects earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.86 for the full 2016 year. Whole Foods investors interpreted the poor results of its industry peer as reflective of the environment for natural and organic grocery products as a whole. Given the challenges that Whole Foods has already faced, this new challenge was the last thing that many Whole Foods investors wanted to see hurting the pioneering chain's potential rebound.
HD Supply dropped 12% after announcing second-quarter financial results that fell short of expectations. The distributor of industrial materials said that net income dropped by about 10%, and the company also reined in its guidance for its third-quarter results. HD Supply now believes that it might not be able to grow its revenue for the full year beyond what it brought in last year, and that could bode poorly for a stock that had been hovering near all-time record highs. Investors will want to see signs that HD Supply can continue thriving no matter what the industrial business cycle brings, and for now, they're concerned that the future might not be as bright as the past has been.
Finally, Advanced Micro Devices fell 7%. The tech company said late Tuesday that it would raise capital through offerings of stock and debt, including a $600 million secondary offering of common shares and $450 million in 10-year convertible senior notes. The company expects to use the net proceeds to repay what it owes on its credit facility and to restructure other debt by offering to buy back outstanding senior notes. The stock drop reflects concerns about the potential dilutive effect of issuing equity, but with the shares having jumped to their highest levels since 2012, AMD seems to be taking advantage of investor optimism at a perfect time. In the long run, the move should be healthy for AMD's business, even if shareholders don't reap as much of the reward as they otherwise might have.

            ","This article was updated on Feb. 8, 2017, and originally published on Sept. 7, 2016.
The virtual reality market could grow from nearly nothing in 2015 to $30 billion by 2020, according to tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital. Piper Jaffray claims 500 million VR headsets could be sold by 2025.
Those numbers sound impressive, but it might be tough to figure out which companies will benefit the most from that growth. In this article, I'll discuss three tech companies that could generate fresh revenue streams from VR in the near future.
Facebook's Oculus Rift. Image source: Oculus VR.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which bought Oculus VR for $3 billion in 2014, is the top VR company to watch because it launched the first high-end commercial VR headset with the Oculus Rift and the first VR app ecosystem with Oculus Home.
Research firm SuperData estimated that Facebook sold about 355,000 Rifts last year. Last May, Facebook claimed that there were already 250 apps available in Oculus Home, which also serves Samsung's mobile-based Gear VR headsets. SuperData estimates that Samsung will sell 2.3 million Gear VR units this year, mainly because the $99 mobile-based device costs much less than the $600 Rift.

But Facebook isn't depending on Rift sales for growth. Instead, it's likely selling the devices at near break-even levels to spur sales of digital content through Oculus Home, where it retains a 30% cut of each sale. With Rift and Gear VR owners tethered to that ecosystem, Facebook could generate meaningful app revenue -- something which it couldn't do during the smartphone generation without a dominant mobile OS. Several Oculus Home games can already be played online with other players, which offers us a glimpse into the future of remote visits in VR space.
Oculus Rift and Oculus Home sales won't generate much revenue for Facebook, which generates most of its sales from ads, in the near future. But over the next few years, app revenues could climb, and Facebook could tether its social network into virtual reality, offering users a game-changing way of remotely interacting with their family and friends.
Sony (NYSE:SNE) launched the PlayStation VR, a VR headset for the PS4, last October. The headset costs $400, while a bundle including the PlayStation camera and Move controllers will cost $500. SuperData predicts that Sony sold 2.6 million PSVRs this year.

Since the PS4 only costs $400, the PSVR offers a more affordable high-end VR experience than the Rift or HTC's Vive ($800), which both require high-end PCs that cost at least $600. While the PSVR will work with current PS4s, the upcoming PS4 Neo upgrade could boost the performance of VR games for a smoother experience. It also differentiates the PS4 from Microsoft's Xbox One, which doesn't have a dedicated VR headset yet.
Strengthening the Game & Networks Services (G&NS) unit is a top priority for Sony, since it often posts stronger year-over-year growth than its other units. Sony could also strengthen its Pictures and Music businesses by selling VR/3D versions of its movies or music videos through the PlayStation Store.
AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is the chipmaking underdog that lost market share to Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 chips and Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) high-end GPUs over the past decade. But despite those headwinds, AMD is still well-poised to capitalize on the growth of the VR market.
First, AMD's RX 480 was the first $200 graphics card which could be used for VR gaming. PC builds using that card, including the $600 example I just mentioned, knocked the price of ""VR ready"" PCs under $1,000. Nvidia recently countered the 4GB RX 480 with the 3GB GTX 1060 at $200, but AMD already established a first-mover's advantage in the low-end VR space. Robust sales of the RX cards could continue strengthening its Computing and Graphics segment, which posted 28% annual sales growth last quarter.

Second, AMD's semi-custom APUs power the Xbox One and PS4. That's because APUs pack CPUs and GPUs together in smaller, more power-efficient packages than stand-alone processors. It's a rare strength that Intel and Nvidia -- the respective leaders in high-end CPUs and GPUs -- notably lack.
That strength boosted AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) revenues by 4% annually last quarter, and upcoming upgrades for the Xbox One and PS4 should ensure that growth continues. If hardware makers start manufacturing stand-alone headsets that aren't tethered to mobile devices or PCs, they could follow the footsteps of consoles and use AMD's APUs -- thus widening its moat against Intel and Nvidia.
The VR market is still in the early stages of development, and long-term forecasts might not be that accurate. But if you believe that VR headsets could become the next big computing platform after computers and smartphones, Facebook, Sony, and AMD could all profit from that paradigm shift.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has seen its stock pop 160%  this year, and there's good reason for that. Investors are benefiting from the company's recent release of new graphics processors, anticipation for its Zen PC processor, and the likelihood of its designs winning placement in Microsoft and Sony's next consoles.  
Many investors are also banking on AMD's new graphics cards, like the powerful Radeon RX 480, to propel the company further into the virtual reality hardware space. The RX 480 is an ideal candidate for high-end VR headsets, and it costs just $200.
That low price, mixed with the current growth of VR, could give AMD a strong position in the VR hardware market, which IDC forecasts will have a 183% compound annual growth rate between now and 2020.
But if investors like AMD as a VR play, I think there are two better buys that they should consider: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 
NVIDIA is, of course, AMD's biggest rival. Between them, the companies enjoy a GPU duopoly, with NVIDIA taking about 66% of the discrete GPU market, and AMD picking up the rest. 
And it's NVIDIA's dominance in GPUs that gives it the clear advantage. The company just released three new notebook graphics cards that add VR-ready capability to notebooks  -- not an easy feat. The company says the cards' processing capabilities come within 10% of those of their desktop computer counterparts.
Most VR-capable PCs are already using NVIDIA's processors, but the company is looking to expand that advantage even further. Jason Paul, the general manager of NVIDIA's Shield, gaming and VR business, recently told Barron's that its GPUs are starting to be used in powerful server computers -- and that those could eventually power virtual reality from the cloud.  
That's worth noting, because as VR grows, it'll become harder for PC's graphics cards (particularly the ones made for notebooks) to keep up with its intense processing demands. Cloud servers could be the answer, and NVIDIA is already making huge strides in the space with its DXG-1 supercomputer. 
VR aside, NVIDA's stock has popped nearly 87% this year thanks to the company's ongoing moves into new markets like driverless cars and machine learning. When it comes to an overall GPU play with a VR-focus, there's no company better than NVIDIA right now.  
I'll admit, it's a bit strange comparing AMD to Google. But both are making their own VR plays, and I think Google is the better investment.
According to Bloomberg, the company is about to launch its new Daydream virtual reality platform and content hub. Daydream will bring VR-focused apps, games, and videos all to one location for mobile devices. 
Bloomberg said that it could become the ""dominant way people engage with virtual reality"" just as Android became the dominant way people engage with smartphones.
Already the company is paying up to hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece for some individual pieces of original VR content for Daydream, and is also partnering with HBO, Hulu, Ubisoft, and the MLB and NBA to launch content on the platform. 
The opportunity for Google is that Daydream could become the place to access VR content on mobile devices (or, at least, Android ones). There is no VR content hub like this right now. Instead of having content creators or hardware makers fight over an online content distribution network, it makes much more sense to let Google bring them all together. And it's the main reason why I think Google could be the biggest VR winner this year.
AMD isn't a bad investment by any means, and its new lineup of graphics cards should keep it a formidable opponent to NVIDIA. But if investors are looking for companies that have distinct VR advantages, Google and NVIDIA are their best bets.

            ","Some investors might think that stocks only quadruple over multiple years. However, several stocks delivered ""four-bagger"" returns over the past 12 months. Let's examine three such stocks -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN), and Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) -- and see if they can keep delivering comparable returns in the future.

Image source: Getty Images.
AMD is an underdog chipmaker which battles Intel in the CPU market and Nvidia in the GPU market. It lost market share in both markets for years, sales fell, and its losses widened as it boosted spending to keep pace. AMD hit a 52-week low of $1.65 on Jan. 20, after it posted a 23% annual decline in revenue during the fourth quarter and offered weak guidance for the first quarter.
But if you had bought AMD that day, you would be sitting on a gain of over 350% today. AMD's sales fell 19% during the first quarter, but it announced strong guidance for the second quarter. During the second quarter, it posted 9% sales growth -- its first annual sales growth in two full years -- on robust demand for its semi-custom SoCs for gaming consoles. It also expects demand for those SoCs to rise as Microsoft and Sony respectively release upgraded versions of the Xbox One and PS4. AMD also returned to non-GAAP operating profitability during the quarter.

AMD now expects its sales to rise 18% for the third quarter, and analysts believe that it could finish the year with 3% growth. Sales of its new Polaris-based GPUs, which have dramatically lowered the price point for VR-ready PCs, could boost its GPU sales, while its upcoming Zen chips might help it regain some market share from Intel. 
Five9 provides cloud software for managing customer relationships at call centers. Its subscription-based VCC (Virtual Contact Center) platform competes directly against Salesforce's Call Center, but Five9 focuses on smaller businesses instead of Salesforce's larger enterprise customers.
Five9 went public in April 2014, and has delivered over 20% annual sales growth in every quarter since its public debut. Its revenue rose 29% last quarter, up from 26% growth in the previous quarter and 23% growth in the year ago quarter. Analysts expect the company to post 22% sales growth this year.
Fire9 also announced an annual dollar-based retention rate of 100% last quarter, up from 94% a year earlier, along with all-time records in enterprise and commercial bookings. Wall Street has already noticed Five9's hot streak -- if you had purchased Five9 at its 52-week low of $3.48 last October, your initial investment would have risen nearly 320%. Five9 is unprofitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP measures, but its losses are narrowing. 
Weibo, the microblogging site often referred to as ""China's Twitter,"" has rallied almost 340% from its 52-week low of $10.90 last October. That massive rally was fueled by Weibo's impressive sales growth -- its revenue rose 36% annually last quarter, compared to 24% growth in the previous quarter and 39% growth a year ago. Weibo attributes that growth to ""the strong adoption of social marketing"" boosting spending among major companies and SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). Analysts expect Weibo's revenue to rise 34% this year.

Image source: Google Play.
Weibo's monthly active users (MAUs) rose 33% annually to 282 million during the quarter, with 89% of users accessing the service from mobile devices. Its daily active users (DAUs) rose 36% to 126 million. By comparison, Twitter's MAUs rose just 3% to 313 million last quarter. Weibo's non-GAAP net income surged 225% to $35.5 million last quarter. On the same basis, Twitter's net income rose 92% last quarter. 
However, both Weibo and its parent company Sina face the threat of government censorship and abrupt shutdowns. Chinese censors temporarily shut down Sina before, erased Weibo accounts, and threatened the companies over poor self-censorship practices. Those threats indicate that Weibo's growth could abruptly grind to a halt due to government intervention.
With the market near all-time highs, investors should be mindful of AMD, Five9, and Weibo's valuations. AMD doesn't look expensive at 1.5 times sales, but Five9's P/S of 5.3 and Weibo's P/S of 18.3 look pricey. Therefore, investors should realize that these rallies could fade quickly if their streaks of hot sales growth end.

Both Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) have seen their stock prices skyrocket by about 70% over the past three months. That's great news for the companies' current shareholders, of course, but when it comes to picking the long-term winner between the two, which is your best bet now?
To answer that, let's take a quick look at what each of them has going for it:
AMD is a major player in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, where it completes with the other GPU powerhouse, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While NVIDIA makes the majority of sales in the discrete GPU market, AMD has managed to increase its percentage to about 34%. 
Some of AMD's share price gains came after the recent release of its new Radeon RX 480, RX 470, and RX 460 graphics cards. While NVIDIA has had its share of major product releases this year as well, investors were likely impressed that the company's graphics cards are much cheaper than NVIDIA's.
There are also two new growth areas that AMD is poised to benefit from: PCs and virtual reality (VR). Lots of companies are betting on VR, but AMD's GPUs, like its new RX 480, are capable of handling the data-processing demands of higher-end VR headsets. 
Combined, the markets for virtual reality and augmented reality are expected to hit $70 billion by 2020, and AMD should be able to grow its GPU sales right along with that trend. VR hardware sales (which include graphics cards) are expected to grow by 183% between now and 2020, according to IDC.
Additionally, AMD says it will unveil its new Zen PC processor in the first quarter of 2017. The long-awaited processor should help it expand further into the higher-end PC market (an area it currently lags far behind in). 
If all that weren't enough, AMD's processors for gaming consoles are poised for more growth. Sony is releasing an updated version of its PlayStation 4 soon, called the Neo, and Microsoft is readying a new version of the Xbox One. Both are expected to ship with AMD's technology inside them. Gaming consoles could play an integral role in VR adoption, which leaves even more opportunity for AMD.
Ambarella is best known for its SoC (system on a chip) hardware that powers GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) action cameras. That's been both a blessing and a curse for the company, as its fate is largely tied to how well or poorly GoPro's devices are selling.
Ambarella's recent share price gains have been due in large part to the company's strong fiscal Q1 2017 beat, and to investors' anticipation that there are even brighter days ahead.
That optimism has been fueled by the company notching more design wins across all of its major business segments in the past quarter, according to management's comments on the Q1 earnings call. But it remains to be seen whether Ambarella can live up to investors' positive feelings by delivering solid earnings. Second-quarter revenue estimates are for a range of between $60 million and $66 million, which would represent a 21% to 28% year-over-year decline.
Ambarella also makes image-processing semiconductors for drones, security cameras, and automotive cameras, and is expanding into processors for virtual reality headsets. All of these are very promising markets, but the company's bills are still largely paid from sales of chips to GoPro. 
That could be a temporarily good thing for the company this holiday season, when GoPro's Karma drone and its new HERO5 camera are expected to debut. It's believed that Ambarella's hardware won a spot in the HERO5, and might also be found in the Karma drone as well. 
Longtime Ambarella investors may already be used to the company's chaotic stock price pops and dips, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of them as we edge closer to the holiday season. The current stock price run-up makes the shares tempting, but remember that if the HERO5 and Karma wind up with poor sales (or if Ambarella didn't win a spot for its hardware in the drone), we're likely to see another huge sell-off. Because the company's fate is still so closely tied to GoPro's, I don't think Ambarella is a great long-term bet. 
As for AMD, some of the company's stock price gains are based on speculation about the future prospects of PC processor sales and VR adoption. That's not all bad, because these are two legitimate areas for investors to get excited about. But the company is also grounded in solid GPU sales and is continually gaining more market share in that space. 
AMD's fate isn't as closely tied to another single company as Ambarella's is, and for that reason -- along with its strong GPU position -- it's the better play for long-term investors.

It's been a great year to be an AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholder. The chipmaker's stock has risen nearly 170% year to date, strongly outperforming almost all of its peers and the broader market.
With the year more than halfway over, let's take a quick look back at some of AMD's best moves to date.
In June, AMD unveiled three new graphics processors: the RX 480, RX 470, and RX 460. All three are aimed at buyers on a budget, retailing for between $100 and $200. The flagship RX 480 is particularly notable, as it's able to power high-end virtual reality headsets, including the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.
Almost half of AMD's 2016 rally has come in the wake of these new GPUs. The market for virtual reality headsets is projected to surge in the years ahead. Research firm IDC believes that nearly 65 million VR headsets will ship in 2020, up from fewer than 10 million this year.
AMD remains a secondary player in the market for GPUs, but along with rival NVIDIA, holds a duopoly over the space. Investors appear to like AMD's prospects, as the RX 480 could help it court consumers unwilling to pay for NVIDIA's more expensive silicon.
About 60% of AMD's sales come from its enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment. The bulk of that revenue is directly attributable to AMD's video games business. AMD's chips power all current-generation video game consoles, including the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
In the past, video game console-makers released new systems every five to six years. However, the industry appears to be in the midst of a major shift, with more incremental hardware releases occurring more often. That could benefit AMD's semi-custom business in the years ahead.
Earlier this year, AMD confirmed that it had won the rights to three major new devices. One of those devices is Project Scorpio, an upgraded version of the Xbox One console set to ship in the fall of 2017. Another is likely the PlayStation 4 Neo, an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 confirmed to exist, but not yet detailed. The PlayStation 4 Neo is likely to be formally unveiled next month. It will probably sport an AMD chip.
In addition to GPUs and chips for video game consoles, AMD has a significant CPU business. Unfortunately, its CPUs haven't been particularly competitive in recent years. Rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) dominates the market, particularly at the high end -- if you purchase a PC that retails for more than $600, there's a good chance it will be powered by an Intel chip.
But AMD could reemerge as a viable market participant as early as next year. AMD has been hyping its forthcoming ""Zen"" processor since 2015, but offered more concrete details this year.
""I'm excited to report that, in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next generation Zen-based processor at Computex in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter, and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers' labs,"" said AMD CEO Lisa Su on the company's July earnings call.
Earlier this month, AMD demonstrated its forthcoming Summit Ridge -- a processor aimed at high-performance desktop PCs and slated to arrive in the first quarter next year. Details remain scant, but Summit Ridge appears to offer performance on par with Intel's i7 6900K, one of the company's top desktop processors.
AMD's business improved in 2016. Last quarter, AMD reported adjusted operating income, up from a loss in the same quarter last year. But the gain was slight, and AMD remains unprofitable under generally accepted accounting principles. At the same time, its sales have risen only modestly, up 9% on an annual basis last quarter.
The bulk of AMD's share price appreciation appears to have been driven by investors' hopes for a brighter future. With Zen on the horizon and interest in VR heating up, AMD could see meaningfully improved financials in the years ahead, justifying its stock's rapid rise.

By virtually any measure, 2016 has been fantastic for AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders. Year-to-date, AMD stock has risen nearly 160%, and is currently trading near levels not seen since 2012.
Why has AMD performed so spectacularly? Although a number of factors have gone in AMD's favor this year, much of its rally can be traced to one product: the Radeon RX 480.
The market for dedicated graphics processors is dominated by just two companies: AMD and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Of the two, AMD is the smaller player. Last quarter, around 10 million graphics cards were shipped worldwide, of which about 30% were powered by AMD's chips, according to Jon Peddie Research. The remaining 70% relied on chips from rival NVIDIA.
But that 30% is a notable improvement from last year. In the second quarter of 2015, AMD captured just 18% of the graphics card market. That upswing could continue, led by AMD's new family of processors.
In June, AMD unveiled three graphics processors based on its new Polaris architecture: the Radeon RX 480, RX 470, and RX 460. As the flagship card in AMD's lineup, the RX 480 is the most intriguing. It retails for just $199, but is able to power virtual reality headsets, including the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.
AMD shares have risen nearly 70% since the RX 480 was officially unveiled. It isn't the most powerful graphics card on the market, but it offers an economical way to experience VR.
""The launch of our new Polaris-based RX 480 GPUs at the end of June...helped contribute to our highest desktop channel GPU shipments since the fourth quarter of 2014,"" said AMD CEO Lisa Su on the company's July earnings call.
For investors interested in VR, AMD is one of the few companies offering significant exposure. Anyone pursuing a high-end virtual reality experience must buy a graphics processor. When they do, there's a good chance they'll buy one from AMD -- most likely the RX 480.
Interest in VR has skyrocketed in recent months, and demand for VR headsets is expected to surge in the years ahead. Research firm IDC projects that shipments of VR headsets will approach 65 million by 2020, up from about 9.6 million this year.
AMD's business has shown signs of improvement in 2016, but much of its rally may be predicated on investors projecting future dominance. Last quarter, AMD's revenue rose, but only modestly, inching up just over 9%. At the same time, it turned an operating loss into positive operating income, but only on an adjusted basis -- and even then, it only earned $3 million.
Rival NVIDIA is offering a suite of superior products. Currently, AMD has absolutely nothing in its arsenal that can hold its own with NVIDIA's flagship GTX 1080. Fortunately for AMD, the GTX 1080 is about three-times more expensive. But NVIDIA also offers competing products at commensurate price points, including the recently released GTX 1060 3GB.
But a rising tide could lift all boats. Even if AMD remains a secondary player in the graphics processor market, it could benefit from broadly growing demand, spurned on by widespread VR adoption.
The RX 480 isn't the best graphics card on the market, but it offers solid performance at an attractive price point. For investors, it gives them a reason to believe in AMD's graphics business. It's hard to think of a better, or more important product, AMD has released this year.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have exploded since last summer, driven by rising optimism that a long-awaited turnaround is finally here. The stock is up an astounding 330% since this time last year, giving investors who stuck it out an incredible return.

Data by YCharts.
These gains have been driven not by improving results but the expectation that they will improve in the future. AMD launched a brand new line of graphics cards, Polaris, earlier this year, and it plans to begin shipping in volume its upcoming Zen CPUs in 2017. Both AMD and the market predict that these new products will drive market share gains, from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the graphics card market and from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the PC and server CPU markets.
There's only one risk that really matters at this point for AMD investors, given the circumstances: It's that Polaris and Zen will fail to deliver on their promises.

Over the past few years, AMD went from a strong player in the graphics card market to an also-ran. Its unit market share slumped from around 40% in 2014 to just over 20% today as NVIDIA won customers with its disruptive GTX 900 series.
AMD has been slowly clawing back market share over the past few quarters, but the company needs something big in order to jump back to where it was two years ago. Polaris, a line of graphics cards aimed at the high-volume mainstream portion of the market, has the potential to reverse AMD's fortunes in the graphics card market. But NVIDIA won't give up its own gains without a fight.
The first Polaris card, the RX 480, launched to good reviews with its $199 to $239 price point representing an aggressive play at the mainstream graphics card market. It only took a few weeks for NVIDIA to respond, launching the $249 GTX 1060 in July, with a $199 version launched earlier this month. The cheaper version is aimed directly at the lower-end RX 480, while the more expensive version delivers better performance for a slightly higher price.
AMD has since launched two lower-end Polaris graphics cards, the RX 470 and RX 460, and NVIDIA has yet to respond with low-end cards of its own. But the main takeaway is that AMD's Polaris, while competitive with NVIDIA's new Pascal graphics cards, isn't the kind of disruptive product that makes for guaranteed wins. Getting back to a 40% unit market share is likely going to take a lot longer than the market seems to expect, creating the risk that AMD's results won't be good enough to justify the now higher stock price.

AMD expects to begin shipping its Zen CPUs in volume next year, and it recently released benchmarks suggesting that the eight core PC version of the chip will be able to go toe-to-toe with Intel's best. There are a lot of problems with AMD's numbers, as pointed out by Anandtech, so we'll have to wait for independent third-party tests before having a good sense of where Zen truly stacks up.
Like with Polaris, the big risk for AMD is that Zen fails to win the strong market reception and corresponding demand that investors expect. Zen is supposed to fix the mistakes that AMD made with its current generation of CPUs, which suffer from lackluster single-threaded performance compared to Intel's products. The performance gap between the two companies will certainly narrow, aided by AMD's move to a 14nm manufacturing process -- but it may not be enough.
It's important to remember that AMD is competing with Intel, a company that has far greater resources, a near-monopoly in the server CPU market, and a dominant share of the PC CPU market. Zen being a massive success for AMD is not a foregone conclusion, although the market is pricing the stock as if it is.
With AMD stock more than quadrupling over the past year despite the fact that the company is still posting net losses each and every quarter, there's a chance that expectations have diverged from the results the company is likely to deliver. I could be wrong, of course, and both Polaris and Zen may be so successful for AMD that the current stock price proves to be pessimistic. But betting on a best-case scenario is a risky gambit. Anything short of perfection will lead to trouble for investors.

Overall, it's been a good year for semiconductors. Versus the greater Nasdaq Composite's return of 3.6%, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) has increased nearly 28%. The most interesting story in the semiconductor space is the red-hot graphics processing unit, or GPU, makers, which are outperforming the larger index by a huge margin during this period.

AMD data by YCharts.
As you can see, GPU makers NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) are outperforming the greater index by a factor of 6 and 12, respectively. Additionally, comparisons between these GPU makers and the SOX don't tell the whole story of GPU outperformance, because the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is a modified market-weighted index that includes NVIDIA -- and its 170% one-year return -- among the 30 stocks it tracks.
Even better for investors, there are still favorable tailwinds that could drive NVIDIA and AMD higher.
The incredible success of Pokemon Go points to huge demand for virtual and augmented reality. While it's important to note that the game most likely did nothing in the short term to boost either company's fortunes, the game's success nevertheless portends tremendous demand for virtual and augmented reality. This will only increase as game makers embrace the augmented- and virtual-reality formats.
Image source: Leadnet.org.
Currently, the most influential company in the virtual-reality space, Facebook's Oculus, recommends AMD R9 290 and NVIDIA's GTX 970 video cards, or greater, to ensure the full Rift experience on Oculus-ready PCs. As true virtual reality increases in popularity, and the small group of VR innovators currently using VR diffuses into the larger early adopters/opinion leaders and early majority groups (see: Rogers Diffusion of Innovation graph to the left), upgraded GPUs should be positive tailwinds for the entire industry.
Here's the point: AMD and NVIDIA are the entire industry. As Jon Peddie Research notes, in the first quarter of 2016, AMD boasted 22.8% market share, with NVIDIA taking 77.2% of the add-in graphics board market. Presented another way, AMD and NVIDIA have 100% of the add-in graphics board (read: GPU) market in the first quarter. It's unlikely either of these two companies will concede a large amount of market share to another competitor anytime soon.
It's important to note that all investments have risk. One of the key risks to both AMD and NVIDIA is slowing computer shipment figures. In June, IDC announced it expected PC shipments to fall 7.3% this year, 2 percentage points lower than earlier projections. In April, chip giant Intel announced plans to lay off up to 12,000 employees, 11% of its workforce, as the company has struggled in the wake of falling PC sales. On the surface, it would appear the factory-installed GPU market would suffer as shipments continue to fall.
However, a VR/AR increase would help GPUs offset falling PC sales in a few ways. First, VR-inspired computer upgraders will select units with higher-end, more-expensive GPUs to take advantage of VR functionality; the favorable mix should help offset the headwinds of falling factory-installed shipments figures.
Second, increased VR gaming should increase demand for non-PC chips and other VR-supportive technologies. Last quarter, AMD CEO Lisa Su specifically mentioned Microsoft's next-generation gaming console, Project Scorpio, as a design win for AMD's semi-custom chip business. NVIDIA's Iray software allows panoramic snapshots to be turned into immersive, head-mounted display VR experiences, and they should quickly grow alongside VR headsets and content.
Another risk is that both companies are considered ""expensive"" by traditional metrics. NVIDIA trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 41 times, and AMD has struggled with profitability, posting a rare quarter of GAAP profitability in the second quarter with the help of a gain on the sale of equity interests of a joint venture to China in the recently reported second quarter. However, analysts polled by Yahoo! Finance estimate annualized growth of 24% and 49%, respectively, over the next five years. If VR really is ""the next big thing"" in tech, it's likely those figures will be higher.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have been fierce rivals in the CPU market over the past few decades. Back in 2006, AMD conquered nearly half the PC market with its low-cost chips, according to PassMark Software. But over the past decade, AMD's chips fell far behind Intel's in terms of performance and power efficiency. Last quarter, AMD controlled just 18% of the market while Intel controlled 82%.

AMD's big mistake was waging two separate wars -- one in CPUs against Intel, and another in GPUs against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Both rivals had deeper pockets, enabling them to launch CPUs and GPUs which eventually outperformed AMD's. AMD stuck to the low-end CPU and GPU markets, merged CPUs and GPUs together in its APU chipsets, and diversified into embedded chips for gaming consoles, ARM-based processors for data centers, and other markets.
Intel dominated the PC and data center markets, but it gradually ran out of room to grow. Global demand for PCs started falling, due to longer upgrade cycles and the rise of smartphones and tablets. Intel paid billions in subsidies to convince smartphone makers to use its Atom chips, yet it didn't gain any ground against ARM-based leader Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Demand for Intel's data center chips also sputtered due to weaker enterprise spending and aggressive competition from rivals like IBM. Intel has diversified into new markets like the Internet of Things (IoT) and non-volatile memory, but these businesses remain small and competition remains fierce.
The past decade was disastrous for AMD, with its annual revenues dropping from $5.85 billion in 2005 to $3.99 billion in 2015. During that same period, Intel's annual revenue surged 43%. As a result, AMD stock tumbled nearly 70% over the past decade, while Intel stock has more than doubled. 
However, past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. Last quarter, AMD's revenue rose 9% annually to $1.03 billion, beating estimates by about $75 million and representing its first quarter of year-over-year growth in two full years. AMD expects revenue for the current quarter to rise 18% annually, and analysts believe that it can post 3% sales growth this year and 6% sales growth next year. 
Most of that growth will be driven by its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, Semi-Custom) business, which supplies APUs for the PS4 and Xbox One, as well as the GPU for the Wii U. Sony and Microsoft's PS4 Neo, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio hardware upgrades should continue supporting the unit's growth.

Image source: Company websites.
Intel's revenue rose just 2% annually to $13.5 billion last quarter, missing estimates by $40 million. Weak PC sales caused its Client Computing revenue to fall 3%, and data center revenue rose just 5% -- much lower than the 15% annual growth rate Intel previously targeted. Intel expects sales for the current quarter to rise another 3%, while analysts see its full-year revenue improving 4% for both fiscal 2016 and 2017. 
AMD posted a GAAP net profit of $69 million last quarter, which was a massive improvement from its loss of $181 million in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes gains from a Chinese joint venture, its net loss narrowed from $131 million to $40 million, or $0.05 per share -- exceeding expectations by three cents. Analysts expect AMD's non-GAAP earnings to rise 61% this year and grow at an average annual rate of 49% over the next five years. 
Intel's GAAP net income fell 51% to $1.3 billion last quarter due to some big acquisition-related charges. On a non-GAAP basis, net income slipped 6% to $2.9 billion, or $0.59 per share, but still beat estimates by six cents. However, much of that beat can be attributed to the $804 million Intel spent on stock buybacks during the quarter and thousands of job cuts. Analysts expect Intel's non-GAAP earnings to improve 7% this year and rise at an average rate of 5% over the next five years.
It's tough to do an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison between Intel and AMD's valuations, since the former has been consistently profitable while the latter has a negative P/E due to quarters of losses. However, AMD now trades at just 1.6 times sales, which is much lower than Intel's P/S ratio of 2.9 and the semiconductor industry average of 2.9.
AMD's better growth numbers and its lower P/S ratio indicate that it's a better buy than Intel at current prices. However, AMD can only keep growing if console sales keep rising, its GPUs can counter Nvidia's aggressively priced Pascal lineup, and the Zen CPUs dent Intel's PC market. If AMD misses those targets, it could quickly give up its gains, so it's still a much more speculative play than Intel -- which remains a decent income-generating stalwart for conservative investors.

            ","2016 has been a great comeback year for AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). The chipmaker posted 9% annual sales growth last quarter, representing its first quarter of growth in two years. It also believes sales will rise 18% for the current quarter, while analysts forecast 3% sales growth for the year. 
That growth was fueled by robust demand for its semi-custom SoCs for gaming consoles, and that momentum should continue as Sony and Microsoft roll out their PS4 Neo, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio updates. The upcoming launch of its Zen CPU for PCs could also finally enable AMD to regain some lost ground against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).

Image source: AMD.
Those positive catalysts all boosted AMD stock over 150% to a multi-year high this year, but investors shouldn't gloss over the company's missteps. Let's take a look back at AMD's biggest mistake this year -- the underwhelming launch of its RX 480 GPU -- and what the chipmaker should learn from that blunder.
To understand why the RX 480 was so disappointing, we should first discuss AMD's ongoing battle against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). After AMD bought GPU maker ATI in 2006, it claimed nearly half of the dedicated GPU market with its Radeon cards. But by the first quarter of 2016, AMD controlled just 23% of the market, according to research firm JPR, while Nvidia held the remaining 77%. 
AMD lost market share because it was fighting two tough wars -- one in x86 CPUs against Intel and another in GPUs against Nvidia. As a result, AMD lacked the R&D resources to keep pace with both rivals in chip architecture and power efficiency. To remain competitive, AMD targeted the low-end market in CPUs and GPUs, promising nearly comparable performance as Intel or Nvidia for a lower price tag. 
In GPUs, AMD boosted clock speeds instead of developing more power-efficient architectures -- which meant that AMD cards generally consumed more power and ran hotter than Nvidia ones. Those weren't attractive qualities for desktop PC gamers. But with the Polaris-based RX 460, 470, and 480 chips, AMD wanted to change that perception with a more efficient 14nm FinNET architecture. It also heavily promoted the 4GB version of the RX 480, which costs $200, as the cheapest GPU for ""VR ready"" PCs. 
The initial reviews for the RX 480 were extremely promising. Extremetech called the card the ""best $200 GPU you can buy today."" But during the RX 480's launch week, early buyers reported that the card was destroying motherboards by drawing too much power from PCIe slots. AMD quickly rectified the issue with an updated driver, but the public's first impression of the RX 480 was already tainted.
Shortly afterwards, Nvidia launched the GTX 1060, a competing ""VR ready"" card with 6GB for RAM, for $250. According to an average of several thousand benchmarks on UserBenchmark, the GTX 1060 is 11% faster than the RX 480, with 15% higher all-around performance. This puts a lot of pressure on AMD, since some gamers are probably willing to pay $50 more for 50% more RAM with 15% higher performance.
But Nvidia didn't stop there. It recently launched a 3GB variant of the GTX 1060 for $200, clearly aimed at knocking out the RX 480 as the ""best $200 GPU"" on the market. There aren't any benchmark comparisons between this new version and the RX 480 yet, but a Nvidia spokesman recently told PC World that the 3GB version of the GTX 1060 would be ""about 10% faster"" than the 8GB version of the RX 480, which costs $240. If that estimate is accurate, AMD could soon lose the low-end ""VR ready"" GPU market to Nvidia.
If Nvidia marginalizes AMD in the low-end GPU market, AMD's Computing and Graphics (CPU and GPU) revenue, which fell 15% annually last quarter, will continue declining. As a result, investors might need to wait until AMD launches its next-gen GPU Vega -- which is expected to arrive next year -- to retaliate against Nvidia. 
AMD's Polaris-based GPUs aren't bad, but they arguably can't compete effectively against Nvidia's Pascal-based GTX cards. Nvidia knows precisely how to strike AMD for maximum damage, and AMD's GPU sales might wither over the next few quarters as budget-minded gamers gravitate toward the GTX 1060.

We Fools believe that the stock market is largely rational and prices stocks appropriately the vast majority of the time, but that doesn't mean that it's always correct. Sometimes the markets may be overly bullish or bearish for any number of reasons, and if you can take an alternative stance and be proven correct, then you can be in a position to make a killing.
With that in mind, three Motley Fool contributors are sharing the one stock that they think the market is pricing incorrectly. Read on to see which stocks they picked and why they believe that the market's assessment is wrong.
Brian Feroldi: Short-sellers, or investors who bet against stocks, have placed a target on the back of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME). Currently more than 31% of the company's shares have been sold short, which indicates that many believe that this company's future is looking bleak.
At first glance it's easy to understand why so many have adopted that viewpoint. With the rise of smartphones and digital games, it's not hard to predict that the company's core business is going to be under a lot of pressure into the future.
Image source: GameStop.
I thought so, too, but once I started to look under the hood I realized there are plenty of reasons to believe that the market is wrong.
First, let's get the bad news out of the way. Yes, the company's physical game business is expected to continue to decline from here, but at a far slower rate than you might otherwise believe. Management is only forecasting a 6% annualized decline over the next few years. 
Before you smirk at that claim, it's worth pointing out that cutting-edge video games require a huge amount of storage capacity. The average PS4 or Xbox One video game takes up 40 gigabytes of storage space, which is a big reason why digital penetration in video games is only about 20% (versus 50% for music).  In addition, physical games can be resold in GameStop's stores, allowing the customer to recoup some cash. You can't do that with digital downloads, so those two factors should help to slow the overall decline.
But GameStop isn't simply sitting still, as it has numerous growth opportunities in place that will help to offset that decline. For one, the company is using the shift to digital games as a catalyst for growth. GameStop currently rings up more than $1 billion in sales for digital games, up a huge 263% from 2010. 
GameStop is also pushing into the collectible space by offering game-related apparel, gadgets, toys, and more at its stores. Sales are expected to be $500 million in 2015, and the company has aspirations to reach $1 billion in sales by 2020.
There's also the company's Spring Mobile and Simply Mac concepts, which sell products from AT&T and Apple. Sales from these stores are fast approaching a billion dollars, with more to come in the years ahead.
Add it all up, and management is projecting operating earnings growth of 3% to 5% annually from here. The numbers look even better on the bottom line when you consider the effects of share repurchases, as recent history has shown that the company has had success at taking down its share count.

Believe it or not, even analysts agree that this strategy is going to work. The company is projected to grow its EPS by more than 8% over the next five years. With shares trading for only 8 times trailing earnings and offering up a dividend yield of 4.7%, I can't help but think the shorts have bet against the wrong company.



Tim Green: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have surged a mesmerizing 320% over the past year, providing those betting on a turnaround with an incredible gain. The company has already launched the first of its Polaris graphics cards, meant to win back market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and it plans to release its upcoming Zen CPUs next year. Following years of share losses to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in both the PC CPU and server CPU markets, investors are banking on Zen to right the ship.
The first tangible signs of a turnaround surfaced when AMD reported its second-quarter results. The company managed to grow revenue year over year, and while AMD still posted a significant net loss, margins improved. The bull case that has been driving the stock higher over the past year is simple: Polaris and Zen will allow AMD to win back market share from NVIDIA and Intel, heralding in a new era of growth and profitability for the company.
The bear case is also simple, especially following the stock's massive gains over the past year: Both Polaris and Zen will face plenty of competition, and significant market share gains are far from guaranteed. NVIDIA has already launched the GTX 1060, a mainstream competitor to AMD's RX 480, and competitive lower-end cards from NVIDIA are likely later this year. And Intel, which has a near monopoly in the server CPU market, outspends AMD on R&D by a factor of 13. It's certainly not impossible for AMD to stage a triumphant comeback, but I think the market is getting way ahead of itself.
John Rosevear: Here are two charts for your consideration. The first shows General Motors' (NYSE:GM) operating profit margin, excluding special items, in every quarter since the beginning of 2014. (Yes, General Motors. Bear with me here, it's a good story.)

Second, here's how GM's stock price has performed over the same period.

GM data by YCharts.
Interesting, no?
Full disclosure: I did cheat somewhat by choosing a cherry-picked time period. GM's margin in the first half of 2014 were clobbered by the costs of its ignition-switch recall mess, so the slope of the increase looks particularly dramatic. But I only cheated a little: The trend overall has been upward since GM's first post-IPO quarter in 2012, when its margin was around 5.8%.
In fact, last quarter's 9.3% margin was a record. It's not a fluke, either: CEO Mary Barra is driving a series of long-term initiatives (learn more about them here) that are intended to put GM's margin into the 9% to 10% range sustainably by early next decade. There may well turn out to be a sizable increase in revenue (and therefore profits) along the way, too. 
Image source: GM.
It's true that GM was the poster child of the bad old days of Detroit. But that GM is long gone: Over the last few years, GM's quality ratings have skyrocketed, it has emerged as a leader in electric cars and self-driving technology, and it has become much more shareholder-friendly.
What do I mean? Old GM talked about market share and its long-gone glory days as the world's largest-selling automaker, while ignoring the advances made by its rivals. Barra and her team talk about return on invested capital, about returning excess cash to shareholders, about out-disrupting Silicon Valley, and about becoming the world's most profitable automaker.
It's a great story that much of Wall Street seems to be overlooking. The upshot is that right now, GM is dirt cheap: It's trading at just 4 times trailing-12-month earnings, with a dividend yield of almost 4.7%. (Read why that dividend is probably sustainable through a recession.) 
Investors are worried about a near-term slowdown in the U.S. new-car market, but GM's longer-term prospects are very bright. For a patient investor, this one's worth a close look.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 33.5% in July 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Some of the boost came from a solid second-quarter report and all the analyst love that followed. The rest was fueled by buyout speculation and a rosy analysis of AMD's future chip designs.
So what: In the second quarter, AMD's revenue rose 9% year over year. The microchip designer reported a net loss of $0.05 per share, but analysts were expecting about twice as much red ink. Several analyst firms issued bullish reports based on this report, and share prices rose more than 14% the next day.
That gain took place on a Friday, near the end of July. Come Monday, AMD shares raced another 15% higher. One analyst firm speculated that the company could be the target of a buyout attempt. That angle was supported by a successful launch of the new Polaris graphics chip architecture, which looks capable of keeping AMD competitive in this generation of the graphics wars.

AMD data by YCharts.
Now what: AMD shares have now more than doubled in 2016 and tripled over the last 52 weeks. The company is not easy to pin down with simple price-to-earnings metrics, since the bottom line remains negative. The chip underdog has sported positive free cash flows over the last four quarters, but that $107.5 million windfall works out to an enterprise value-to-cash flow ratio of a sky-high 61. By contrast, archrivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) have EV/FCF ratios of 15.2 and 27.9, respectively.
In other words, AMD's valuation is riding high and the company is under tremendous pressure to deliver strong growth and improving profitability if it wants to defend these share prices. The expensive nature of this stock also makes it a less likely takeover target, assuming that the prospective buyers care about paying a fair price.
This stock has been downright exciting to watch in recent quarters, but I'm not convinced that AMD's rally has staying power. I'd suggest watching this one from the sidelines, at least until AMD can prove that it has a clear path to sustainable profits.

            ","Investors might think that it's tough to find tech stocks that can double within a year. But over the past year, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) all accomplished that feat, and could keep rallying. Let's see how these three companies delivered such big returns in such a short time.
Nvidia stock has soared more than 150% over the past 12 months for three reasons. First, it dominates the PC gaming market with its GeForce cards, and demand within that niche market is rising as more graphically intensive games hit the market. That market is also well insulated from the global slowdown in PC shipments. 

Image source: Nvidia.
Second, its GPUs are being installed in an increasing number of data centers for machine learning purposes, since they can process certain science applications at a faster rate than Intel's industry-standard Xeon processors. Lastly, Nvidia pivoted its Tegra mobile chips toward connected cars, which gave it a firm foothold in infotainment systems and onboard computers for autonomous vehicles. 
These strategies all boosted Nvidia's sales growth from single-digit to double-digit levels over the past few quarters as its non-GAAP gross margins expanded. Looking ahead, analysts expect Nvidia's growth to continue with 12% sales growth and 46% earnings growth this fiscal year. 
Shares of AMD have surged 210% over the past 12 months, which is surprising because its CPU and GPU businesses were marginalized by Intel and Nvidia, respectively. AMD sold cheaper chips than both rivals, but they usually lagged behind both in terms of chip architecture and power efficiency. 
But over the past few years, AMD made a comeback by investing heavily in EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) chips for non-PC platforms. The unit's semi-custom SoCs now power the PS4 and Xbox One, and its GPU powers the Wii U. The unit has also been expanding into data centers with ARM-based 64-bit chips.

That strategic shift paid off, and AMD posted 9% year-over-year sales growth during the second quarter of this year, marking its first quarter of annual sales growth since the second quarter of 2014. It also expects that growth to continue with 18% sales growth for the current quarter. While AMD still faces tough battles ahead in the GPU and CPU markets, that positive growth was enough to propel the stock to four-year highs.
Silicon Motion is a Taiwanese chipmaker that produces flash controller ICs (integrated circuits) for storage products and RF (radio frequency) ICs for mobile devices. In the storage market, its ICs are installed in solid state drives, flash memory cards, USB drives, embedded multimedia cards, and connected cars. In the mobile market, its ICs are used in smartphones, tablets, and PCs. 
Since Silicon Motion only provides the controller for the flash storage devices, it isn't exposed to the decline in memory prices which has hurt flash storage companies like Micron. Growth across that larger unit has offset declines at its smaller RF business.
Silicon Motion's revenue and non-GAAP earnings grew at their fastest rate in the company's history last quarter. Revenue rose 61% year-over-year, up from 40% growth in the previous quarter and 26% growth a year ago. Non-GAAP net earnings improved 26% sequentially and 69% annually. Analysts expect that impressive growth to continue with 45% sales growth and 55% earnings growth this year. Those explosive figures explain why the stock has rallied 120% over the past 12 months.
But before investors go chasing Nvidia, AMD, and Silicon Motion Technology, they should check their valuations to see if they're overpriced. 
Nvidia currently trades at 50 times earnings, which is notably lower than the average P/E of 75 for the specialized semiconductor industry. Its forward P/E of 36 is also lower than its projected earnings growth rate for the year. This means that if Nvidia beats analysts estimates over the next few quarters, its stock could still be undervalued at today's prices.
AMD isn't profitable, but its P/S ratio of 1.3 still looks low. Nvidia and Intel respectively trade at 1.7 and 2.9 times sales, so AMD could be undervalued if it keeps posting year-over-year sales growth. Silicon Motion trades at 24 times earnings, which is much higher than the industry average of 15 for diversified electronics companies. But its forward P/E of 14 is much lower than its projected earnings growth rate, so Silicon Motion could still have room to run.
Investors shouldn't avoid stocks just because they've doubled or tripled over the past year. But they should do their homework to see if the positive sentiment which fueled those rallies is sustainable, and if their valuations are still supported by their long-term growth potential.

            ","While hundreds of companies will report quarterly results in August, there are two that stand out. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), the leader in the graphics card market, will need to keep up its recent pace of growth in order to justify its increasingly lofty valuation. And brick-and-mortar retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), faced with a tectonic shift toward e-commerce, has its hands full returning to earnings growth while taking on the Amazon.com juggernaut. Here's what investors need to know about these two companies.

Image source: NVIDIA.
NVIDIA has consolidated its lead in the discrete graphics card market over the past two years, claiming a nearly 80% unit market share during the first quarter and leaving Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with the scraps. At the same time, NVIDIA's push into the data center, pitching its GPUs as ideal accelerators for artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks, has created a fast-growing business for the company.
NVIDIA will report its second-quarter results after the market close on Aug. 11. The stock has been on fire over the past year, up about 175%, as investors have increasingly bet that the company's profits will soar in the future. NVIDIA is at the center of a buzzword trifecta -- artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and self-driving cars -- and investors can't get enough of the company's stock.
With NVIDIA stock now trading for more than 50 times last year's earnings, the company will need to impress when it reports its second-quarter results. Sales of its high-end gaming GPUs have been consistently strong, and that's unlikely to change with AMD offering no real alternative at the moment. But further market share gains will be tough, especially with AMD going after the mainstream portion of the market aggressively. And NVIDIA's growth businesses, including data center and automotive, are still small relative to the core PC GPU business.
With the stock priced at an optimistic level, NVIDIA will need to show that it can produce the earnings growth that investors are expecting.

Retail behemoth Wal-Mart expects its earnings to decline during the second quarter, results for which it will announce on Aug. 18. The company has been making major investments in higher wages for its employees, new training programs, and e-commerce, sacrificing profits in the short-term in an effort to drive growth and customer satisfaction in the long-term. Wal-Mart expects to produce between $0.95 and $1.08 in per-share earnings, compared to $1.08 during the second quarter of last year.
Already, some of these initiatives are bearing fruit. The U.S. business has reported positive comparable sales for seven quarters in a row, and customer service scores are improving. The e-commerce business is growing, albeit slowly, as Wal-Mart expands initiatives like its ShippingPass program and its online grocery pickup service.
Wal-Mart's $3 billion acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet demonstrates how much of a priority online sales have become for the company. Jet launched last year to substantial buzz, promising to undercut Amazon on price by offering discounts based on how many items shoppers buy. With the Jet acquisition, Wal-Mart is following the same strategy that it always has -- offering the lowest prices possible.
Investors shouldn't expect much improvement when it comes to profitability anytime soon, as Wal-Mart doesn't expect meaningful earnings growth to return until fiscal 2019. But the company needs to keep showing progress, particularly positive comparable sales growth in its U.S. business. A surprise drop in sales would likely undo some of the stock's gains this year.

            ","The past decade wasn't kind to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), which ceded the x86 CPU market to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and lost the GPU market to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). AMD's CPUs and GPUs were cheaper, but they always seemed to lag behind Intel and Nvidia in terms of architecture and power efficiency. 

Image source: AMD investor presentation.
Between 2005 and 2015, AMD's annual revenue dropped from $5.85 billion to $3.99 billion. During that same period, Intel's annual revenue rose 43% and Nvidia's revenue more than doubled. AMD lost nearly 70% of its market value over the past decade and went through three CEOs before Lisa Su took over in late 2014. 
But under Su, AMD recently scored a major victory during its second quarter by achieving its first period of annual sales growth since the second quarter of 2014. Sales rose 9% to $1.03 billion during the quarter, beating estimates by about $75 million. AMD expects that growth to continue with about 18% sales growth for the third quarter. That news lifted AMD stock to four-year highs. 
Over the past few years, AMD realized that attacking Intel and Nvidia head-on was futile, since both companies had superior cash flows and higher R&D and marketing budgets. Instead, AMD pivoted toward certain niche markets which its rivals had overlooked. 
In 2013, it scored design wins with Sony and Microsoft to respectively power the PS4 and Xbox One with its semi-custom APUs -- which combine the functions of a CPU and GPU on a single SoC (system on chip). It also supplied the GPU for Nintendo's Wii U, which effectively locked Nvidia out of the eighth generation of gaming consoles. 

All powered by AMD. Image source: Company websites.
Sales of semi-custom SoCs for consoles became a pillar of growth for AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which generated 58% of its sales last quarter. Revenue at the unit rose 5% annually and operating income more than tripled to $84 million. That growth offset an $81 million operating loss at its computing and graphics business. Looking ahead, the EESC business will likely get a boost from new updated consoles like Sony's PS4 Neo and Microsoft's Xbox One S and Scorpio.
AMD also sees niche growth potential in data centers, a market which Intel dominates with its Xeon processors. Instead of competing against Intel with x86 CPUs for high-end servers, AMD has started shipping ARM licensed chips for lower-end servers. To complement that move, AMD formed a joint venture with Chinese firm THATIC earlier this year to develop SoCs for the Chinese server market. It also formed another joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics to expand its ATMP (assembly, test, mark, and pack) capabilities in China.
Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that the fledgling virtual reality market could grow from practically nothing today to $30 billion by 2020. That growth could benefit AMD in two major ways.
When the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were launched earlier this year, consumers had to buy a $1,000 PC to use the headsets. Since the Rift costs $600 and the Vive costs $800, VR remained a hobby for rich tech enthusiasts instead of mainstream consumers. However, AMD recently lowered the price of VR-ready PCs considerably with its $200 RX 480, the cheapest VR-capable card on the market. Current PC builds using the RX 480 have reduced the price of a VR-ready PC to just $600. 
The Rift and Vive currently depend on the PC's GPU power, but companies will likely launch stand-alone headsets which aren't tethered to desktops in the near future. Like gaming consoles, these devices will run better on efficient semi-custom APUs instead of stand-alone CPUs and GPUs. AMD's market-dominating position in semi-custom APUs for consoles gives it a major advantage in this market.
Posting 9% sales growth might not seem like a huge victory, but it's certainly AMD's biggest win of the year so far. However, investors shouldn't ignore three upcoming challenges that could derail AMD's turnaround. 
First, Nvidia's new GTX cards offer a lot of power for just a little more cash. The new GTX 1060, for example, offers better performance than the RX 480 for just $50 more. Second, AMD must prove that its Zen x86 chips, which will arrive at the end of the year, can effectively compete against Intel's upcoming Kaby Lake and stop the bleeding at its CPU business. Lastly, Nintendo has reportedly selected Nvidia's Tegra to power its upcoming NX console, which will likely arrive next March. If the NX is a surprise hit like the original Wii, it could hurt sales of the PS4 and Xbox One and AMD's EESC sales. 
I think AMD's outlook is improving, but I'd be hesitant to call it a ""turnaround"" until it can overcome those challenges. But if AMD's revenues can continue growing year-over-year for the next few quarters, it could be the start of a major comeback for the beaten-down chipmaker.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) returned to revenue growth during the second quarter, showing signs of progress that have been absent for years. The company is still losing money, but new product launches this year and next have the potential to turn around AMD's fortunes. While much can be gleaned from AMD's financial results, management's commentary during the company's conference call provided some invaluable information for investors. Here are four quotes, taken from a transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.
AMD launched its first Polaris graphics card, the RX 480, in late June. With an MSRP of either $199 or $239 depending on the amount of memory, the RX 480 is aimed squarely at the high-volume mainstream portion of the market. So far, AMD CEO Lisa Su is happy with the launch:
We are pleased with the Polaris launch, initial channel sales, and OEM design wins. We expect this strong demand to continue and help drive revenue growth in the third quarter with the launch of the RX 470 and RX 460 desktop GPUs, and Polaris-based notebooks from our OEM customers.
The RX 480 and its lower-end companions will help drive AMD's graphics business during the second half of the year. AMD's unit share of the discrete graphics card market has tumbled over the past two years. During the first quarter of 2016, AMD shipped just 22.8% of discrete graphics cards, according to Jon Peddie Research, down from around 40% during the first quarter of 2014.
Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has lapped up the market share that AMD has lost, launched a mainstream graphics card of its own in July. The GTX 1060 is priced at $249, but according to NVIDIA it offers substantially better performance and efficiency than AMD's RX 480. AMD expects to grow its graphics business during the second half, but it remains to be seen how much market share it will be able to wrestle back from NVIDIA.
The semi-custom business has been a major success for AMD. The company's SoCs (system on a chip) power both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, providing a reliable source of revenue. As game console inventory is built up for the holiday season, Su expects the third quarter to be strongest for the segment:
As in the previous two years, we expect semi-custom shipments to peak for the year in the third quarter, as both Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holidays. Based on strong demand, we believe semi-custom unit shipments and revenue will grow on an annual basis.
In addition to the game console business, AMD will begin to recognize revenue from two additional semi-custom design wins during the second half of the year. AMD expects each deal to generate roughly $500 million of revenue spread across three to four years, enough for the semi-custom segment to grow in 2016. Another semi-custom design win, Microsoft's Project Scorpio console, will begin generating revenue for AMD in 2017.
AMD's upcoming Zen CPUs are expected to improve the company's competitive position relative to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The first PC variants should start shipping toward the end of this year, with significant volume in 2017. The server market may represent an even larger opportunity for AMD, given that Intel currently enjoys a near-monopoly. Su gave a progress update:
We are pleased with the performance we are seeing with Zen hardware, which is helping to expand our customer engagements and accelerating design win momentum across multiple OEMs and ODMs. We remain on track for volume shipments of our Zen server CPU in the first half of 2017.
Intel's corporate strategy now revolves around the cloud and the data center, with PCs remaining an important but shrinking focus. The company's data center segment has been the company's growth engine as the PC market has sputtered, and AMD will undoubtedly face major challenges getting its server chips into cloud data centers currently dominated by Intel.
The good news for AMD is that Intel's pace of moving to smaller process nodes has slowed, with the company abandoning its ""tick-tock"" strategy for an elongated three-step approach. AMD's manufacturing disadvantage will be narrowed with the launch of Zen, and that should help the company make some headway in the server chip market.
Despite the progress AMD has made, the company is still posting significant losses. The company reported a free cash flow loss of $322 million during 2015, a pace that threatened to deplete AMD's cash reserves in just a couple of years.
AMD has taken some steps to shore up its balance sheet, and the result is a larger cushion that gives the company more time to turn itself around. CFO Devinder Kumar explained:
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $957 million at the end of the quarter, up $241 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to net cash proceeds from the ATMP JV transaction, offset by working capital needs in the quarter.
AMD announced a deal to sell its assembly and test facilities to a newly created joint venture last year, which brought in a total of $371 million in cash. Inventory buildup for the second half offset some of these gains, but the net result has been an influx of cash that gives AMD some much needed breathing room. The company is no longer at risk of running low on cash anytime soon.
It now appears that AMD's financial performance has bottomed out. Revenue is growing again, and losses are beginning to shrink. A return to GAAP profitability may still be distant, but the company's balance sheet is in a better position to handle the second phase of AMD's turnaround.

Virtual reality is one of the more exciting trends in technology. The industry remains in its infancy, but several companies are positioning themselves to take advantage of the growing demand for VR headsets and content. Facebook and NVIDIA are popular picks, and for good reason: Both companies could play major roles in the VR economy.
But unfortunately, both stocks are expensive, Facebook perhaps exceptionally so. Investors looking for a bargain might consider AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) or Sony (NYSE:SNE) instead.
If you want to use a high-end virtual reality headset, such as Facebook's Oculus Rift or HTC's Vive, you'll need a PC equipped with a powerful graphics card. Right now, there are only two companies offering such a card, and AMD is one of them. That gives it an opportunity to grow its graphics business substantially in the months and years ahead.
AMD's share of the graphics card market lags behind that of market leader NVIDIA by a sizable percentage. In the first quarter of the year, AMD captured just 22.8% of the market compared to NVIDIA's 77.2%, according to Jon Peddie Research. But AMD has an opportunity to claw back market share by capturing the low-end segment.
AMD's Radeon RX 480 has received fairly strong reviews since it went on sale late last month. The graphics card is capable of powering today's virtual reality headsets, while retailing for just $199. That makes it the most affordable virtual reality-capable graphics card on the market, as NVIDIA's competing GTX 1060 is 25% more expensive.
AMD could also benefit from Sony's forthcoming PlayStation VR. The Japanese gaming giant's VR headset plugs into its PlayStation 4 video game console rather than a PC. Gamers who wish to use Sony's headset won't need to buy powerful graphics cards; instead, they just need consoles. AMD's chips power the PlayStation 4, and increased demand for the console could translate into additional revenue.
From a valuation perspective, AMD is inexpensive. Admittedly, it isn't profitable, and after rallying upwards of 45% in the last four weeks, it isn't as cheap as it was when I recommended it last month. Still, its enterprise value to trailing revenue hovers near 1.7, considerably lower than Facebook's and NVIDIA's. Its trailing price-to-sales ratio, at just 1.4, is similarly modest.
Increased demand for the PlayStation 4 could benefit AMD, but as the maker of the console, Sony could capitalize to an even greater extent. To date, the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 40 million units, and that's helped Sony reward shareholders. Year-to-date, Sony shares have risen more than 23%, outperforming the broader market.
In its fiscal year ended March 31, Sony's video game business generated less than 19% of its revenue, but brought in almost one-third of its operating income. If Sony's guidance proves accurate, it will bring in 45% of its operating income this fiscal year.
PlayStation VR will make its retail debut on Oct. 13. It will work with existing PlayStation 4 consoles, but could also entice some gamers to upgrade. Although Sony has yet to formally unveil it, it has confirmed that it plans to release an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 at some point in the near future. That extra horsepower could dramatically improve the VR experience.
At $399, the PlayStation VR is expensive, but is cheaper than other competing solutions (Facebook's Oculus Rift retails for $599). By itself, the PlayStation 4 is less expensive than a high-powered PC with a capable graphics card, and is easier for the average consumer to setup and use. Moreover, Sony has video game studios and partnerships it can leverage to create quality content for its headset.
Trading with a price-to-earnings ratio near 32, Sony may not look like a bargain, but it's cheaper than other names in the space. And on the basis of other valuation metrics, including enterprise value-to-trailing revenues and price-to-sales, Sony is cheaper than AMD.
Of course, Sony is a complex business with many other segments, but with gaming accounting for an increasing share of Sony's earnings, VR could emerge as a key driver for the stock in the years ahead.

            ","Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) upcoming NX console could be a portable device with detachable controllers, according to Eurogamer. If the report is accurate, the NX's core device would resemble the Wii U GamePad, but function as a stand-alone handheld on the go. However, it will be possible to remove the controllers on the sides from the screen, and plug the base unit into a TV for big-screen gaming.

The NX looks like an extension of the Wii U concept, but addresses the fact that the Wii U GamePad couldn't work as a stand-alone handheld if it wasn't in range of the console. The NX will also reportedly use game cartridges with flash memory instead of optical discs. This makes sense, since loading times are faster and the price of flash memory has declined dramatically, but the 32GB cartridges which Nintendo is recommending could be too small for many modern games.
Those revelations surprised many gamers, who had expected Nintendo to launch a beefier console to challenge Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One. However, the reports about the NX included a pleasant surprise for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) investors -- the device could be powered by its Tegra processors instead of AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD).
Nvidia's Tegra processors were originally designed to challenge Qualcomm in the mobile market. But when it realized that most OEMs wouldn't use Tegra chips, Nvidia pivoted the Tegra line toward Android gaming devices, set-top boxes, and infotainment and telematics systems for cars. 
In recent quarters, demand from the automotive industry has been the core driver of Tegra sales, which rose 10% annually to $160 million (12% of Nvidia's top line) last quarter. Within that total, automotive chip sales rose 47% to $113 million. That growth convinced many investors that connected cars were much more important than Android consoles or set-top boxes to Tegra's future.
The last time Nvidia had a stake in the console market was with the PS3, which was powered by a proprietary GPU it co-developed with Sony. But when the eighth generation of consoles (PS4, Xbox One, Wii U) arrived, all three console makers installed AMD's hardware instead of Nvidia's. 
Sony and Microsoft installed AMD APUs -- which merged CPUs and GPUs together in semi-custom system on chips (SoCs) -- in the PS4 and Xbox One. Nintendo paired an IBM PowerPC processor with an AMD GPU in the Wii U. AMD saw the shutout as a major victory for its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which offset its slower sales of CPUs and GPUs for PCs. 
Nvidia claimed that it ""let"" AMD conquer the console market because the margins were too thin. AMD called Nvidia's declaration a case of ""sour grapes"". Since then, Nvidia's presence in gaming has been an uneven one -- early Tegra-powered Android consoles like the Ouya flopped, while its Shield handheld, tablet, and set-top boxes remain niche devices.

Nvidia's Shield tablet. Image source: Nvidia.
The upgraded PS4 (PS4 Neo) and Xbox One (Scorpio) -- which will be launched with 4K and VR games in mind -- will likely run on upgraded versions of AMD's custom APUs. This means that Nvidia's only way back into the console market is through Nintendo.
Unfortunately, Nintendo has been a laggard in the home console wars. According to industry tracking site Vgchartz, Sony has sold 42.5 million PS4s worldwide, compared to 21.8 million Xbox Ones and 13.2 million Wii Us. But if we include Nintendo's 3DS handheld in the ""eighth generation"", it's actually the best-selling console with 58.7 million units sold. 
Nintendo is trying to leverage its strength in handhelds to straddle the handheld and home console markets with the hybrid NX. Since Nvidia basically tried the same thing with its Tegra-powered Shield tablet -- which converts into an Android ""console"" when hooked up to a TV and a wireless controller -- its CPU (which includes an integrated GPU) is a natural fit for the NX. Using a more power-efficient mobile processor like the Tegra is also necessary to boost the NX's battery life when used as a handheld.
However, Nintendo will likely sacrifice graphical horsepower by using a Tegra instead of an AMD APU. This indicates that Nintendo is more interested in creating a ""unique"" device instead of competing against the PS4, Xbox One, and PC. This means that third-party developers could shun the device, as they did with the Wii U, and force Nintendo to rely mainly on first-party titles. But if the NX is a surprise hit like the original Wii, third-party developers should flock back.
Nintendo's NX might boost sales of Tegra chips when it arrives next year, but it probably won't overtake the importance of connected cars to overall Tegra sales. It probably also won't be a stepping stone back into Sony or Microsoft consoles, since AMD has the market locked down pretty tight with its high-performance APUs.

Growth returned to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) during the second quarter, with the company reporting far higher revenue than analysts were expecting. AMD still posted a loss after backing out a one-time gain from the formation of its assembly and testing joint venture, but that loss was smaller compared to the prior-year period.
The stock surged on the news, with investors betting that AMD's second-quarter results foretell a turnaround during the second half of the year. While AMD showed progress, there are still a few items that need to fall into place before AMD will be able to produce sustained growth and return to profitability. Here's what investors need to know about AMD's second quarter.
AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $1.03 billion, up 9% year over year and $69 million higher than analysts were expecting. The computing and graphics segment, which includes the company's PC CPUs and GPUs, generated $435 million of revenue, up 15% year over year. AMD attributed the increase in sales to higher demand for its notebook processors and GPUs.
The semi-custom segment, which includes game console SoCs as well as embedded and enterprise products, produced $592 million of revenue during the quarter, up 5% year over year. As AMD's share of a shrinking PC market has declined in recent years, its semi-custom business has been a bright spot for the company. The second quarter was no exception.
AMD produced a non-GAAP loss of $40 million, or $0.05 per share, down from a loss of $131 million, or $0.17 per share, during the prior-year period. The average analyst estimate called for a loss of $0.08 per share. Non-GAAP operating profit was positive at $3 million, a milestone that AMD heralded in its earnings press release. The company had previously projected that it would return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second half of the year.
On a GAAP basis, AMD produced an operating loss of $8 million and a net profit of $69 million, or $0.08 per share. A one-time gain of $150 million related to the company's assembly and test joint venture boosted GAAP earnings. Excluding this gain and the related taxes, GAAP net income would have been a loss of about $54 million.
Improvements in profitability came from both segments. The computing and graphics segment produced an operating loss of $81 million, down from a loss of $147 million during the prior-year period. The semi-custom segment offset that loss with an $84 million operating profit, up from just $27 million, with $11 million of operating costs not attributed to either segment. Higher revenue and gross margin, as well as a $26 million licensing gain, drove the improvements compared to the same period last year.
AMD expects its revenue to grow sequentially by 18% during the third quarter, to roughly $1.21 billion. That would represent year-over-year revenue growth of about 14% if AMD hits its guidance. The third quarter is always the strongest for the semi-custom business, with game console inventory being built up for the holiday season, but AMD expects to report year-over-year growth in that segment as well.
AMD reiterated its guidance for revenue growth in 2016 and non-GAAP operating profitability during the second half of the year. Strong semi-custom sales along with the launch of AMD's Polaris graphics cards are expected to drive the company's results. The RX 480, a mainstream card, was launched at the end of June, and AMD will be filling out its lineup of Polaris graphics cards throughout the rest of the year.
While a return to revenue growth and non-GAAP profitability are two important steps in AMD's turnaround, producing GAAP profits excluding one-time gains will require the company to increase its revenue further. Polaris may help AMD win some market share back from NVIDIA, which has built a commanding lead over the past couple of years in the graphics card market. And Zen, AMD's upcoming line of CPUs, is expected to make the company more competitive against Intel.
The success of Polaris and Zen will ultimately determine whether AMD's turnaround gains traction. If either fails to live up to expectations, the signs of progress AMD reported during the second quarter may not mean much in the long run. For now, though, AMD investors are rightfully celebrating the first genuinely positive results from AMD in quite some time.

What: Shares of semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose sharply for the second trading day in a row on Monday, climbing as much as 19%. The stock closed the trading day up 14.7%, or up a total of 28.4% in the past two trading days. The move follows the company's better-than-expected second-quarter results reported after the market closed on Thursday.
So what: AMD stock's move on Monday could be related to continued optimism about the company's second-quarter earnings report, which featured a narrower-than-expected loss per share and higher-than-expected revenue. Further, AMD returned to non-GAAP operating profits one quarter earlier than management had indicated it would.
But other speculation is floating around on Monday, which may have driven some of the optimism surrounding the stock. In particular, Forbes contributor Patrick Moorhead reported AMD sent him a note when he inquired about the company's 14nm chip plans, which he asserts makes him more confident in the company's chip plans. The article can be read in full here.
Now what: Investors should refrain from jumping to any new conclusions about the company based on an analyst note. Investors who are interested in Moorhead's conclusions should reach out directly to the company to verify these facts, or wait for management to confirm what Moorhead is reporting.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has been fighting a losing war against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in high-end GPUs over the past decade. AMD controlled nearly half the dedicated GPU market back in 2006. But by the first quarter of 2016, AMD controlled just 23% of the market, according to research firm JPR, while Nvidia controlled the remaining 77%.
The bears believe that AMD will fall behind Nvidia in GPUs and Intel in CPUs, and end up pigeonholed in niche markets like embedded processors. But there's also a more bullish narrative anchored in virtual reality.

In that thesis, console and headset makers will use AMD's APUs (which combine CPUs and GPUs), because they're generally more cost effective than stand-alone CPUs and GPUs. AMD's new ""VR-ready"" add-in graphics boards could also enable consumers to build cheaper PCs which can run apps for high-end headsets like Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift or HTC and Valve's Vive. Let's discuss that second theory, and see if AMD can challenge Nvidia in the low-end VR-ready GPU market.
AMD's cheapest VR-ready GPU is the RX 480, which has a base clock speed of 1.3 Ghz, 4GB of VRAM, and costs $200. Nvidia's competing device is the GTX 1060, which has a base clock speed of 1.5 Ghz, 6GB of memory, and costs $250.
Early benchmarks on the two devices at PCEVA indicate that the 1060 offers 6%-7% better graphics performance on the latest version of 3DMark's Time Spy DirectX 12 benchmark. Those results are encouraging for AMD, since some customers might question the value of paying 25% more for a 7% performance boost.
They're also better than the ""leaked"" 3DMark Firestrike benchmarks from XFastest in early July, which indicated that the 1060 could outperform the RX 480 by 15%. However, future benchmarks which fully utilize the GTX 1060's higher VRAM could reveal a bigger performance gap between the two cards.

AMD investors should also be wary of two headwinds. First, Nvidia's growth over the past decade has been fueled by robust brand loyalty for its GeForce cards. This arguably enables it to charge a premium on its devices without losing market share to AMD. 
Second, Nvidia has a strong track record of launching more advanced and power efficient chip architectures before AMD. AMD has generally tried to keep pace by boosting clock speeds instead of developing new architectures, which occasionally leads to overheating problems. AMD addressed this perception with a more power efficient 14nm FinNET architecture in its latest GPUs, but the initial launch of the RX 480 was marred by power draw issues -- which were subsequently resolved with a new driver.
Facebook, HTC, Valve, and other PC-based VR headset makers need the price of GPUs to decline to make VR-ready PCs more affordable. Prior to the launch of the RX 480 and GTX 1060, the average price of a VR-ready PC was roughly $1,000. Adding the $600 Oculus Rift or the $800 Vive to that rig made the entire setup a toy for rich gadget enthusiasts instead of mainstream consumers.
New gaming PC builds using the RX 480 or GTX 1060, however, have already reduced the average price to around $700. While that still keeps the price tag of the VR experience well above $1,000, it might attract more mainstream consumers who were looking to upgrade their aging PCs. The prices of Nvidia and AMD's VR-ready cards will likely decline over the next two years, which will make VR-compatible a standard feature on most PCs. 
If that happens, the VR market could grow from nearly nothing today to $30 billion by 2020, as tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital predicts. Headset sales could soar to half a billion units by 2025, according to Piper Jaffray's estimates. 
Nvidia has two distinct advantages over AMD. First, it's allocating most of its R&D and sales/marketing expenses on its GPU business. AMD, however, must allocate those expenses to three fronts -- its GPU battle with Nvidia, its CPU battle with Intel, and its expansion in enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) processors. Nvidia's GAAP operating expenses were nearly 50% higher than AMD's last quarter -- indicating that it has much more cash for big marketing blitzes. 
Second, Nvidia had a GAAP gross margin of 57.5% last quarter, compared to AMD's gross margin of 32%. This means that if AMD gains market share against Nvidia, Nvidia can dramatically lower its prices to regain lost ground. This would be bad for both chipmakers' margins, but gamers and VR headsets would benefit from the arrival of cheaper VR-ready GPUs.
Nvidia has clear advantages in the VR-ready GPU battle, but AMD will likely hold its ground with considerably cheaper GPUs with just slightly lower specs. Therefore, it's unlikely that Nvidia will flush AMD out of the market, but it's equally unlikely that AMD will steal much market share away from Nvidia without triggering a major price war.

            ","What: After Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported better-than-expected second-quarter results on Thursday following the market close, shares of the semiconductor company jumped as much as 14.4% on Friday, and are up 12% at the time of this writing. This extends the stock's incredible performance recently; shares are up about 190% in the past six months.

So what: Investors are likely upbeat about AMD because the company's loss per share was narrower than expected, and its revenue was higher than expected. Adjusted to exclude one-time items, AMD reported a loss of $0.05 per share, better than analysts' consensus estimate for an $0.08 loss. Revenue increased 9% to $1.027 billion -- above analysts' consensus estimate for revenue of $951.3 million. Further, the company returned to non-GAAP operating profitability one quarter ahead of schedule, reporting non-GAAP operating income of $3 million.
""In the second quarter we accomplished a significant milestone as we returned to non-GAAP operating profitability based on solid execution and strong demand for our semi-custom and graphics products,"" said CEO Lisa Su.
Now what: Going forward, Su is optimistic, expecting strength in the company's semi-custom products and its latest Radeon RX and 7th Generation A-Series APUs ""to drive growth and market share gains in the second half of the year.""

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) launched the first of its long-awaited Polaris graphics cards in June, raising hopes that a turnaround was right around the corner. That turnaround won't be evident in the company's second-quarter results, though, as the RX 480 came at the very beginning of the third quarter. AMD is set to report its second-quarter numbers after the market close on Thursday, July 21. Here's what investors need to know.
AMD managed to beat analyst estimates on all fronts in April when it reported its first-quarter results. Revenue came in at $832 million, down 19% year over year but about $13 million higher than the average analyst estimate. On a non-GAAP basis, AMD posted a loss of $0.12 per share. That number was worse than the $0.09-per-share loss in the prior-year period, but it was a penny better than analysts were expecting.
Along with beating first-quarter expectations, AMD provided guidance for the second quarter that was above what analysts predicted. AMD anticipates growing revenue on a sequential basis by 15%, well above the 7% growth that the average analyst estimate called for.
The biggest news had nothing to do with AMD's results. The company announced that it had licensed its processor and SoC intellectual property to a newly created joint venture targeting the Chinese server market. AMD will receive $293 million in licensing fees, contingent on the JV achieving certain milestones, in addition to royalty payments from future sales.
AMD will be launching new server chips next year based on its upcoming Zen microarchitecture, and the JV offers a second path for AMD to claw back market share. In the near term, the deal bolsters AMD's balance sheet and gives the company more time to turn itself around. In the long term, it improves AMD's chances of reasserting itself in the server chip market.
After a rough few years, analysts forecast that AMD will post growth during the second quarter. The average estimate calls for a 1% year-over-year increase in revenue to $951.6 million, up from $942 million during the prior-year period and in-line with the company's guidance.
AMD is still expected to post a loss, although analysts expect an improvement in that area as well. The average estimate calls for a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, substantially better than the $0.17-per-share loss AMD reported during the same period last year.
Analysts are expecting AMD's results to improve later this year and next year, driven by both Polaris and Zen. The average estimate calls for 0.9% revenue growth in 2016, followed by 5.4% revenue growth in 2017.
AMD's Polaris graphics cards, which target the mainstream portion of the market, won't have an impact on AMD's results until the third quarter. But investors should look for management to give an update on the launch during the company's conference call. The RX 480 garnered positive reviews, and for a brief period, rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) won't have a competitor at the price point AMD is targeting.
But the announcement of NVIDIA's GTX 1060, a $249 card that promises to best the RX 480 in terms of both performance and efficiency, could pose a problem for AMD. The competing card is set to launch on July 19, cutting short the period during which the RX 480 faces no current-generation competition. NVIDIA shipped about 77% of discrete graphics cards during the first quarter, and the GTX 1060 will act as a major obstacle to AMD's plan to win back market share.
The PC version of AMD's Zen CPU is still expected to launch toward the end of this year, although the chips are unlikely to have much of an effect on AMD's results until 2017. Polaris and Zen are the linchpins of AMD's turnaround, and the company will need both to be successful in order to pull itself out of the red.
Shares of AMD have soared so far this year on the hope that the company's turnaround is finally taking shape. The stock is up nearly 90% year to date, a sign that confidence in the company has vastly increased. The second half of 2016 will be the real test of whether AMD's strategy will ultimately pay off. If Polaris or Zen fall short of expectations, AMD investors could be in for a rough ride.

This contest isn't even close. Image source: Getty Images.
Let me cut to the chase. These two stocks have almost nothing in common.
NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is a solid business with a bright future. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a risky turnaround bet with a lot to prove. Apart from working in the same semiconductor industry, AMD and NXP couldn't be more different if they tried.
That's the view from 30,000 feet. Here's a more detailed version of the same argument.

Data from YCharts..
Breaking down the financial data above, you'll find that NXP is firmly profitable and modestly priced. The stock trades at 2.4 times NXP's book value, which is on the lower end of price-to-book valuations among chip stocks with similar business models.
AMD, on the other hand, shows negative earnings and is burning cash. Sales have fallen 18% over the last four quarterly reports, and the company carries a negative book value. In other words, AMD's financial papers suggest that, if the company were to liquidate its assets, pay off its debts, and return the remainder to shareholders, investors would end up owing money to the debt holders.
Yet, AMD shares have nearly tripled over the last 52 weeks, while NXP shares lost 13%. The long-term picture works out the other way around, with NXP creating shareholder value, and AMD destroying it.
To AMD's credit, the company recently introduced a long-awaited graphics processor platform. The so-called Polaris architecture is locking horns with the equally fresh Pascal technology from arch-rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). That's a refreshing change from recent years, where AMD has been lagging far behind NVIDIA's graphics products in terms of both performance and bang for your buck.
But AMD is priced for perfection, and the company has a long history of making product promises it can't keep. Investors can only hope that AMD's Polaris and the upcoming Zen processors will make the company relevant again. That's a big leap of faith, not a calculated risk. And if the company fails to deliver, share prices would tumble down again. There's not much substance to this business.
The Dutch chipmaker is also betting the farm on a new market, but from a much stronger position than AMD. After merging with sector rival Freescale Semiconductor, the company has become the name to beat in automotive computing. That was a thriving sector when it was just based on a proliferation of semiconductors in modern infotainment and engine control systems. Now, the industry is taking its first trembling steps into self-driving cars.
It seems obvious that true autopilot systems for cars eventually will become commonplace. When that happens, you'll see a radical spike in car-mounted processing muscle. And NXP has built the perfect beast to capture this hockey-stick moment in time.
On top of all that, NXP's broad portfolio of data security and communications solutions would keep the company afloat in case the automotive computing boom rolls off the rails somehow. AMD doesn't have the luxury of a solid Plan B, and absolutely needs its handful of significant innovations to succeed. There is no safety net there.
So there you have it. NXP is already successful, and ready to launch into an even higher orbit as an automotive computing leader. In the opposite corner, AMD investors are betting that the company will ignite a turnaround rocket ride for the ages with the Zen and Polaris chips.
I would much rather invest in NXP's combination of promise and stability than in AMD's unproven hopes and dreams. How about you?

As NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) focuses on the high end of the graphics card market with the GTX 1080 and GTX 1070, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) was left with an opening. The first graphics card based on its Polaris graphics architecture, the RX 480, is a mainstream product priced at $199. AMD ceded the high end of the market for the time being in an effort to win back as much market share as possible.
During NVIDIA's last big graphics-card refresh, which began in late 2014 with the GTX 970 and GTX 980, a mainstream card didn't arrive from the company until four months after those high-end cards were released. With AMD gunning for mainstream market share, the story is different this time around. NVIDIA recently announced the GTX 1060, a mainstream $249 card aimed squarely at the RX 480. It will arrive on July 19, just a few weeks after AMD's first Polaris card became available, and a little more than a month after the GTX 1070 launched.
AMD's RX 480 comes in two variants. A version with 4GB of memory is priced at $199, while an 8GB version sells for $239. The GTX 1060, which comes equipped with 6GB of memory, will be in direct competition with the pricier RX 480. NVIDIA still won't have any new graphics cards selling at $200, but it probably0 won't be too long until the company fills in that gap.
According to benchmarks from Tom's Hardware, the RX 480 provides gaming performance that falls a bit short of NVIDIA's last-gen GTX 980, which was a high-end card. That's impressive for a $239 graphics card. But it now looks like NVIDIA's GTX 1060 will be just as impressive, if not more so. NVIDIA is claiming that the GTX 1060 will be 15% faster and 75% more power efficient than the RX 480, which, if true would put AMD in a difficult position.
The large difference in power efficiency should be surprising. Both NVIDIA's Pascal cards and AMD's Polaris cards have moved to 14/16nm FinFET manufacturing, which brings with it efficiency improvements. But if NVIDIA's numbers are taken at face value, they suggest that AMD is still well behind in terms of efficiency. The RX 480 has had some issues with drawing too much power, which has since been fixed with a driver update, but the whole episode reflects poorly on AMD.
The good news for AMD is that it will still have the best $200 graphics card available, at least for the time being. A GTX 1050 and/or GTX 1050 Ti will be coming at some point from NVIDIA, but so far there's no word on the timing.
AMD has been posting losses for a few years now, and one side-effect has been a shrinking R&D budget. During 2015, AMD spent just $946 million on R&D, down from $1.07 billion in 2014 and $1.45 billion in 2011. This R&D spending is spread across both CPUs and GPUs, meaning that the company's graphics business is only getting some fraction of those resources.
NVIDIA now outspends AMD when it comes to R&D, despite all of its products being built around its graphics technology. NVIDIA spent $1.33 billion on R&D in 2015, about 40% more than AMD. Some of this spending goes toward NVIDIA's growth businesses, like its self-driving-car platform, but it's safe to say that the company has more resources to devote to GPU development than AMD.
This mismatch in R&D spending seems to have created a situation where AMD is perpetually behind NVIDIA when it comes to efficiency. The RX 480 certainly represents a substantial improvement compared to AMD's previous generation of products, but the card uses nearly as much power as NVIDIA's high-end GTX 1080 under load. That raises some questions about how competitive AMD's eventual high-end products will be.
The GTX 1060 looks like it's going to take the wind out of AMD's sails. We'll have to wait until independent benchmarks become available, but based on what NVIDIA has said about the GTX 1060's performance, AMD's RX 480 is looking a lot less impressive.

In investing, a general rule of thumb is that stocks will return roughly 7%-10% per year over the long term. Using the Rule of 72 as a guide, investors can expect to double their initial investment every seven-to-10 years, on average.
Of course, that's simply the average. If you had the foresight to buy these three companies a mere 52-weeks ago, you'd be sitting on returns in excess of 100%.
Graphics processing units (GPU) manufacturers have been on fire. The two largest GPU manufacturers, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), are both up approximately 150% during the past one-year period. The overall industry is in the midst of positive tailwinds: The growth of eSports and virtual reality functionality will most likely lead to a large upgrade cycle for both companies.
It's folly to assume that both companies are in the same place financially. AMD has consistently struggled with profitability, and is viewed as more of a turnaround investment. In the last few years, NVIDIA has gobbled up market share to the detriment of AMD, rising from 60% add-in board unit market share in 2014 to nearly 80% as of the end of 2015. NVIDIA has transitioned to a platform company, with solutions for gaming, VR, and even automotive markets.
Recently, both companies have introduced new graphics architecture: NVIDIA announced its Pascal in May, while AMD introduced Polaris soon thereafter. With favorable industry tailwinds, it's likely both companies can continue to power higher.
The last year hasn't been positive for the greater Chinese stock market, with the Shanghai Composite Index down 15% during this time frame. As far as economic conditions, the country is cooling a bit: The World Bank now expects fellow Asian country India to surpass the country from a GDP growth standpoint. One stock that seems to be unaffected is Chinese social network Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), which has increased approximately 130% in the last year.
Two factors are leading Weibo's over performance. The first is the company's huge increase in monthly active users. In its annual filing, Weibo reported 236 million monthly active users, or MAUs, in December 2015, up 34% from its 175.7 million the company reported in in December 2014. Additionally, 83% of Weibo's MAUs accessed Weibo from their mobile devices in 2015; 63% of the company's advertising and marketing revenue was from high-growth mobile.
The second reason is that the company has been rumored to be an acquisition target for the past year. Chinese etailer Alibaba has been mentioned as the potential acquirer. Alibaba already owns approximately 30% of Weibo, and current Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang is on Weibo's board of directors.
If you're looking for a stock positioned to grow from increased internet activity from a growing Chinese middle class, keep Weibo on your watchlist.

The stock market has come close to hitting new record highs recently, but it still hasn't pushed much higher over the past year. Major market benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrials are only up about 3% to 4% from this time last year. Yet when you go beyond the indexes to invest in individual stocks, some companies have proven to be much more successful, and investors who found some of the best performers have seen their money double in just a year's time. Below, we'll take a closer look at three of these two-baggers to see if there are more gains in store for those who are only now getting into these stocks.

NVDA Total Return Price data by YCharts.
The technology industry is a common source of stocks that post high returns, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) certainly hasn't disappointed shareholders recently. The maker of high-end graphics cards has seen its stock jump 163% since July 2015, and the stock has given investors a fairly steady ride upward over the past 12 months, with only minor pullbacks along the way that have tended to follow overall market disruptions.
Much of NVIDIA's success has come from its ability to capture even more of the market for graphics cards than it already had. Competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which you'll see discussed in more detail below, has made its own efforts to try to carve out a bigger niche for itself in graphics products. But NVIDIA nevertheless has seen massive market-share gains of about 20 percentage points since early 2014 and now commands four-fifths of the overall market.
More importantly, NVIDIA commands the higher end of the market, and that puts it on the cutting edge of future advances. With the move toward greater centralization of computing power, NVIDIA's data center business has become more important, and in its most recent quarter, the company said that its data center-related sales jumped more than 60%. As long as cloud computing keeps demand high, NVIDIA has the opportunity to keep posting gains.
Top returns often come with huge volatility, and Weight Watchers International (NYSE:WTW) is the best example of that fact. Shareholders have seen their stock rise 200% over the past year, and yet there are some who would say that they're actually disappointed by the way Weight Watchers has moved recently.
Image source: Weight Watchers.
Weight Watchers' biggest gains came late in 2015, when investors responded very favorably to the fact that celebrity Oprah Winfrey had taken an equity stake in the company, joined its board of directors, and looked to lend her renown and reputation to support the weight-loss specialist. The hype from Winfrey's move sent the stock up more than 550% in the span of less than six months, and subsequent releases showing her progress in losing weight with the Weight Watchers program has led to occasional pops in the stock as well.
Yet Weight Watchers has given back a sizable portion of those gains in 2016, as momentum investors appear to have grown impatient with the company's progress. Recent reports have included big gains in important metrics like subscriber count and meeting attendance, but year-over-year revenue has continued to fall. Even an increase in the company's earnings guidance for the full year wasn't enough to get the stock to move further in the right direction. In the long run, Weight Watchers and Winfrey could be a winning team, but the stock price arguably reflects that potential already.
Whenever stocks move sharply higher, it's important to put the rise in context. Advanced Micro Devices has gained 154% over the past year, which is undoubtedly impressive. However, even after that gain, the chipmaker's stock has returned less than 10% for investors who bought it two years ago, and longer-term investors are still sitting on massive losses.
This time last year, AMD was struggling badly. Falling PC sales had sent the stock sharply lower over the preceding year, and many investors saw little chance for the company to regain its lost profit potential. Even initiatives to focus on semi-custom chips for areas like the gaming console industry weren't enough to offset declines from the core computing and graphics segment, and AMD's losses multiplied from past levels.
Image source: AMD.
Yet since then, AMD has seen some promising things happen. Its new Polaris graphics architecture has a chance to help it fight back against NVIDIA and recapture some of its lost market share in the discrete graphics card market. Advanced Micro also hopes that its semi-custom business will move beyond game consoles and have its chips appear in other applications. Some investors also see promise in the data center business as a new source of revenue for AMD. The company's historical also-ran competitive position still makes some skeptical, but Advanced Micro Devices has at least bought itself more time as it seeks to be more competitive.
Stocks don't double in value all that often, and it's risky to expect more gains after a big jump. For these three stocks, AMD has the most room to turn its business around and produce positive returns, and NVIDIA has the chance to take a leadership role in its industry. Weight Watchers, however, must prove it can build momentum in order to get its stock moving back upward.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) recently launched its RX 460, 470, and 480 graphics cards for the budget GPU market. The Polaris-based cards cost from $100 to $240, are optimized for virtual reality games, and are powered by 14nm FinNET GPUs, which are more power-efficient than Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) 16nm GPUs. 
The RX 480, which is priced at $200 for the 4GB version and $240 for the 8GB version, reportedly offers comparable performance to Nvidia's older GTX 980, which costs about $100 more. While none of the Polaris cards are designed to challenge Nvidia's newest GTX 1070 and 1080 cards -- which start at $380 and $600, respectively -- they could appeal to more budget-minded gamers who want a cheaper way to experience high-end VR games. AMD's initial launch was met with glowing reviews, with ExtremeTech calling the RX 480 the ""best $200 GPU you can buy today.""

The RX 480. Image source: AMD.
Unfortunately, that positive buzz was immediately overshadowed by reports of power draw issues with the RX 480. The RX 480 was advertised as having a maximum power draw of 150W, but initial reports showed that some cards were drawing as much as 170W from some systems. Furthermore, the affected cards drew up to 90W from the PCIe slot, which far exceeded the 75W that the slot was intended to provide. 
The AMD discussion boards quickly filled up with complaints of fried PCIe slots, and AMD stated that it was working on an updated driver to fix the issue. It's unclear whether or not a software update can get the cards to behave, but it raises some serious questions about AMD's GPU business.
AMD has lost a lot of ground to Nvidia in gaming GPUs over the past few years. Research firm JPR reports that AMD controlled just 23% of the add-in graphics board market in the first quarter of 2016, compared to Nvidia's 77% share. 
While Nvidia has dedicated most of its R&D and marketing to its GPU business, AMD has been trying to battle Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in x86 processors and Nvidia in GPUs at the same time. AMD has been losing both those battles and must split its R&D expenses (which were already 32% lower than Nvidia's in their most recent quarters) across its CPU, GPU, and embedded chip businesses. 
As a result, AMD has constantly struggled to match Intel and Nvidia in developing more power-efficient hardware. To keep up with Nvidia, AMD took the cheaper route of boosting clock speeds without upgrading its architecture as frequently. This meant that AMD's cards often offered performance comparable to Nvidia's cards at lower prices, but the cards also drew more power and ran hotter -- which wasn't great for high-powered gaming rigs. 
AMD knew that it needed to make its cards more power-efficient to appeal to PC gamers, a market that has bucked the the overall slowdown in the PC market. The 14nm Polaris cards were supposed to enable AMD to sell cards that were both cheaper and more power-efficient than Nvidia's high-end cards from last year. 
AMD says that it will release the new RX 480 driver on July 7, along with a software update that will add optional ""compatibility"" profiles to reduce the card's overall power consumption. In addition to lowering the PCIe power draw below 75W, AMD promises that the new driver will boost overall performance by up to 3%. 
If the software update fixes the problems with the RX 480, AMD customers and investors should breathe a sigh of relief, since the issue likely isn't hardware related. But if additional power draw issues appear after the update, the problems could be more deeply rooted and might impact sales of the new card. 
AMD stock has nearly doubled over the past 12 months on high hopes that its Polaris GPUs, next-gen Vega GPUs, Zen CPUs, and new SoCs for upgraded PS4s and Xbox Ones will turn its business around. The RX 480 plays a key role in this turnaround, since it's the top card in its budget VR push, so investors should follow this story closely to see if the power draw issues are resolved in a timely manner.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 12.5% in June, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The big news for AMD during the month was the announcement and launch of the Radeon RX 480, the company's first graphics card based on its Polaris architecture.
So what: AMD announced the RX 480 on June 1, confirming that its first Polaris graphics card would be a mainstream part priced at $199. Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) had previously announced two high-end cards based on its new Pascal architecture, leaving AMD with an opening to steal market share at lower prices.
The RX 480 launched on June 29 to positive reviews. NVIDIA will almost certainly launch a competing mainstream product in the coming months, but for the time being AMD has a good chance at picking up some market share. The company shipped just 22.8% of discrete graphics cards during the first quarter, according to Jon Peddie Research, down from around 40% in the same period two years ago.
While AMD's turnaround efforts have yet to positively affect its financial results, the launch of the RX 480 has helped drive optimism that the company is on the cusp of returning to growth. This optimism drove the stock higher in June.
Now what: While it appears likely that Polaris will help AMD claw back some market share from NVIDIA, a return to profitability may still take some time. During AMD's latest quarter the company posted at $109 million net loss, driven by weak sales of CPUs, GPUs, and console SoCs. That's a deep hole that AMD will need to pull itself out of, and the success of both Polaris and Zen, the company's upcoming CPU architecture, will likely be required.
AMD's turnaround is no longer a long-shot in the eyes of investors, evidenced by the 12.5% jump in the stock price in June and the more than 70% rise so far this year. But AMD will need to meet expectations for those gains to stick around.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have surged 70% so far this year as of market close on June 24. While the company has been struggling in recent years, a flurry of new products slated for release in 2016 has raised investors' hopes that a turnaround is right around the corner.
So what: AMD has suffered from market share losses to both Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market over the past few years. The company is wildly unprofitable, posting a $660 million net loss in 2015 on $3.99 billion of revenue. So far this year, the company's numbers haven't been showing any signs of improvement.
But there are a few reasons to believe that AMD's fortunes could improve. The company's latest graphics architecture, Polaris, represents an aggressive bet on the mainstream graphics card market at a time when rival NVIDIA is focusing on the high-end portion of the market. The Radeon RX 480 will be released on June 29 for just $199, with lower-end cards to follow, giving the company an opportunity to win back market share. During the first quarter, AMD's unit share stood at just 22.8%, down from around 40% in early 2014.
Later this year, the first of AMD's Zen CPUs are expected to be released, with server variants coming in 2017. Zen will bring major improvements in performance and efficiency, and with the chips being built on a 14 nanometer process, the manufacturing gap between AMD and Intel will shrink. AMD's previous CPU architecture was largely a disaster for the company, leaving it with uncompetitive products, and Zen is supposed to right that wrong.
In addition to new product launches driving the stock price higher, AMD struck a major deal in April to license its chip technology to a new joint venture in China. The purpose of the JV will be to develop chips for servers to be sold in China, thus giving AMD another avenue to attack Intel's dominance in the data center. AMD expects to receive $293 million in licensing fees in addition to ongoing royalties.
Now what: With the chip licensing deal bolstering AMD's balance sheet, the company now has more time to turn itself around. Investors are betting that both Polaris and Zen will succeed in winning market share from NVIDIA and Intel, reversing the long slump AMD currently finds itself in.
If AMD can deliver competitive products on time this year, the 70% jump in the stock price so far in 2016 could be warranted. But if AMD falls short, either by under-delivering on its promises or by delaying Zen, these impressive gains may not hold.

Demand for virtual reality is expected to surge in the years ahead. Research firm IDC expects that more than 110 million VR headsets will be sold in 2020, up from 9.6 million headsets in 2016.
Investors looking to add exposure to the trend have a number of stocks to choose from, including both NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). But while those companies may offer attractive upside, their shares certainly aren't cheap, trading for about 40- and 69-times trailing earnings, respectively.
Those investors looking for more of a bargain might consider AMD (NASDAQ: AMD). The computing giant seems likely to play a large role in the market for VR experiences, as its graphics cards could power many VR-capable PCs in the years ahead.
Admittedly, AMD isn't profitable. Last quarter, it lost $109 million. AMD's management believes the firm will become profitable in the second half of the year on an adjusted basis, but will remain unprofitable under generally accepted accounting principles for some time. That means AMD has no trailing -- or even forward -- price-to-earnings ratio. Still, it compares favorably to Facebook and NVIDIA based on many other metrics.
AMD's trailing price-to-sales ratio, for example, hovers around 1, compared to 5-times for NVIDIA and more than 16-times for Facebook. Its enterprise value to trailing revenue is likewise considerably lower: about 1.5-times for AMD, 4-times for NVIDIA, and 15-times for Facebook. That's not to say Facebook and NVIDIA are unreasonably expensive: both businesses are booming. NVIDIA's revenue rose 13% on an annual basis last quarter; Facebook's surged 52%. But at current levels, investors are certainly paying for that growth.
AMD's business, in contrast, is less attractive. In addition to losing money, sales were actually down over 19% last quarter. 
But if demand were to rebound, shares could catapult higher. Last year, the company set its long-term earnings per share target at around $0.50. If the market were to value AMD as highly as NVIDIA, shares could have 300% upside. Even with a modest 15-times multiple, AMD could still rally 50% from current levels.
But where is the rebound in AMD's business going to come from? VR offers an interesting avenue for AMD's growth.
There are several ways consumers can experience VR today, including low-tech budget options such as Google Cardboard. But more immersive, compelling experiences require the use of high-end VR headsets, most notably Facebook's Oculus Rift. The social network's gaming device isn't a stand-alone gadget; rather, it must be used in conjunction with a powerful PC equipped with an expensive graphics card.
AMD's share of the graphics card market has fallen precipitously in recent years, yet it maintains its long-standing duopoly with NVIDIA. If you want to use the Oculus Rift, you'll need a PC equipped with a graphics card from one of the two companies. For VR, NVIDIA's lineup was widely seen as more attractive, as its 2015 flagship graphics cards outperformed AMD's similarly priced models. AMD's offerings were more competitive at the low- and mid-segments of the market, but didn't offer enough power for compelling VR experiences.
But later this month AMD will refresh its lineup, launching a new graphics card that could become the preferred solution for affordable, VR-capable machines.
AMD's RX 480 retails for just $199. It's not as powerful as NVIDIA's competing GTX 1070, but it costs about half as much. And it's still good enough to drive the Oculus Rift. Today, a PC capable of handling the Oculus Rift retails for around $1,000. The RX 480 should drive that figure down to around $700-$800. And many gamers who already have fully functional PCs could purchase it as an inexpensive upgrade, making their PCs VR-capable in the process.
There are of course other problems to contend with. The Oculus Rift by itself still retails for around $600, and content remains relatively scarce. But with the RX 480X, AMD is doing its part to help bring VR to the masses.
NVIDIA could also introduce a less expensive card in an attempt to counter AMD's offering; but for the time being, the RX 480X is compelling. Look for AMD's share of the graphics card market to rise in the quarters ahead. If VR enters the mainstream, AMD's business should benefit.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have surged far this year, up nearly 80% year to date. AMD has struggled in recent years, with a slumping PC market and share losses to both Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). That struggle continues, but optimism about new products has driven the stock price to its highest level since 2012.

AMD data by YCharts.
This kind of optimism can be dangerous, especially given AMD's history of failing to deliver on its promises. Here are three reasons AMD stock might give up its gains.
AMD recently revealed three graphics cards based on its Polaris graphics architecture. All three cards will focus on the mainstream portion of the graphics card market, with the RX 480, the only card with a firm launch date and price, set to become available on June 29 priced at just $199. The RX 470 and RX 460 will be lower-end cards, but few details have been disclosed.
NVIDIA, AMD's only competitor in the graphics card market, is focusing on the high end. The company announced the GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 in May, priced at $379 and $599, respectively, and based on NVIDIA's Pascal graphics architecture. Both Pascal and Polaris bring major improvements in performance and efficiency.
NVIDIA's unit share of the graphics card market stands at about 80%, up from 60% in early 2014. AMD's bet on the mainstream is an attempt to win back some of that lost market share, and I think the company has a good chance of doing just that. But NVIDIA will almost certainly be launching mainstream Pascal cards in the coming months, and there's no reason to believe they won't be competitive with AMD's products. If AMD doesn't produce the kind of market share gains investors seem to be expecting, the stock could lose some of its recent luster.
Toward the end of this year, AMD is expected to launch new PC processors based on Zen, the company's upcoming microarchitecture. Zen is supposed to fix the major performance problems that plagued the previous generation of AMD CPUs and made it impossible to compete effectively with Intel. AMD has said  Zen will bring a 40% improvement in instructions-per-clock, a measure of single-threaded performance, compared to the previous generation of CPUs.
Next year, AMD will launch server variants of Zen as the company begins its assault on Intel's near-monopoly in the server chip market. While the PC market is shrinking, server chip sales are benefiting from the continued build-out of cloud data centers. Intel's data center segment produced nearly as much operating profit as its client computing segment last year.
The good news for AMD is that Zen will be built on a 14nm process, and Intel won't be moving to 10nm until sometime in 2017, following the company's abandonment of its tick-tock strategy. The manufacturing gap between the two companies will be narrower than it's been in years. It's the perfect time for AMD to launch competitive chips.
There are a couple of things that could go wrong for AMD. Zen could fail to live up to expectations -- it wouldn't be the first time AMD over-promised and under-delivered. And Zen could still be delayed. If either of those scenarios play out, the turnaround story would be in jeopardy, and shares of AMD could tumble.
Even if both Polaris and Zen are viewed as successes for AMD, an 80% increase in the stock price in just a few short months may be a case of expectations getting out of hand. AMD is still very unprofitable, posting a $589 million net loss over the past 12 months on $3.8 billion of revenue. Margins have a lot of room to improve, but the hole AMD finds itself in is deep.
In the company's best year over the past decade, which was 2010, net income was just shy of $500 million. Historically, the company's profitability has fluctuated wildly, especially since 2000. On average, AMD hasn't produced much of a profit at all.

AMD Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts.
With a current market capitalization of around $4 billion, buying AMD at this price requires the belief that AMD is not only going to surge back to profitability, but that the company is going to be fundamentally different than it has been in the past. The stock price may have gotten out ahead of what AMD can realistically accomplish, and any bad news at all could send shares lower.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) revealed the first graphics card based on its Polaris architecture, the RX 480, at Computex earlier this month. The RX 480 is a $199 card aimed at the mainstream portion of the market, selling for a bit more than half the price of NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) cheapest Pascal graphics card, the GTX 1070. AMD's strategy is to win share, sacrificing the high-end of the market for the time being.
While the RX 480 has a firm launch date, June 29, and a firm price, AMD has been less forthcoming with the rest of the lineup. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), AMD teased the RX 470 and RX 460, two lower-end cards set to be released at some point this summer. This brings the Polaris lineup to three cards -- all, presumably, priced below $200.
The RX 480 is being positioned as an affordable way to power virtual-reality headsets like the Oculus Rift. According to AMD, only 16% of PC gamers are currently buying GPUs capable of VR. The minimum requirement for the Rift is a GTX 970 from NVIDIA, or an R9 290 from AMD, both of which launched at well over $300. The RX 480 brings down the price quite a bit.
AMD has revealed very little about the RX 470 and RX 460. The company states that the RX 470 is aimed at ""delivering refined, power-efficient HD gaming,"" while the RX 460 is ""a cool and efficient solution for the ultimate e-sports gaming experience."" Neither will be powerful enough for VR, but PC gaming at 1080p will be less expensive compared to last generation.
If I had to guess, I'd say that the RX 470 will launch for around $150, and the RX 460 for around $100. Those prices would be similar to the launch prices of the last-gen R7 370 and R7 360, but both cards should be substantially more powerful than their predecessors.
NVIDIA's strategy with Pascal follows the typical pattern of launching high-end cards first. NVIDIA announced the GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 last month, priced at $379 and $599, respectively, and a lower-end card from the company is likely still months away. AMD desperately needs to regain market share after losing so much over the past couple of years, and a head start in the mainstream portion of the market may be just what the doctor ordered.
NVIDIA will almost certainly launch lower-end graphics cards to compete with AMD in the coming months. If last generation was any indication, a GTX 1060 and GTX 1050 are likely in the works.
AMD will also likely launch a higher-end card, possibly the RX 490, at some point this summer. The company described its strategy with the RX series as ""delivering enthusiast class performance and features for gamers at mainstream price points from $100-$300."" With the RX 480 priced at $199, there's plenty of room for a higher-end model.
Will AMD's aggressive push into the mainstream-graphics market lead to market-share gains? Probably. The enthusiast portion of the market is small in terms of units, and most of the volume happens at the price points AMD is going after. The company will have a head start, leaving NVIDIA to play catch-up when it finally launches lower-end cards.
I see no reason to believe that NVIDIA's eventual mainstream cards won't be competitive. The company has a major R&D advantage, surpassing AMD in terms of spending despite being focused solely on graphics, and both Polaris and Pascal bring similar improvements in terms of efficiency. NVIDIA's unit market share, which currently sits at around 80%, has gotten high enough that it will be difficult for the company to defend. But that doesn't mean that it will be easy for AMD to get back to where it was a few years ago.
One downside to AMD's mainstream strategy is that a solid $100-$200 graphics card doesn't get the kind of headlines a record-breaking $600 card tends to get. AMD will need to get people excited about the RX series, at least enough to make the plunge before NVIDIA launches competing products. Needless to say, it's going to be an interesting year in the graphics-card industry.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 28.7% in May 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Building further on a fantastic April surge, AMD shares have now soared 82% higher in just three months.
So what: The April pop's driver was pretty obvious, as AMD released a strong earnings report in that month. May didn't have any single nitro-powered growth event. Instead, AMD's rise rested on a couple of smaller pops across the second half of the month.
First, the company announced that its upcoming Polaris graphics platform would be unveiled on June 1. That was a welcome response to recent platform updates from graphics rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), showing that AMD just might have what it takes to stay relevant in this important and rapidly changing market.
Then, a new consortium was formed to promote industry standards for accelerated computing in data center environments. The Murderers' Row of IT heavyweights included AMD but neither NVIDIA nor Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). This move could give AMD a leg up on its largest rivals when consortium members look for number-crunching hardware under the developing Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators (CCIX) standard.
Finally, AMD introduced a new line of graphics processors for high-density blade servers. Designed specifically for virtual computing and virtualized server builds, the FirePro S7100X fills number-crunching needs that are poorly met by AMD's traditional Opteron line of server chips.
Now what: The storied NVIDIA rivalry is heating up again, with both companies rolling out brand-new graphics architectures as we speak. Their next quarterly reports will let us know whether AMD's Polaris or NVIDIA's Pascal better meets the needs of clients in supercomputing and big data analysis. In the meantime, keep an eye on head-to-head comparisons between the two in the hardware enthusiast press.
The summer of 2016 is a pivot point for both of these stocks, as their finest graphics efforts do battle in the open market. The winner is poised to dominate the growing niche for data analysis hardware at a hockey-stick growth moment for that macro trend. If the difference is large, the loser is doomed to long-term irrelevance. Otherwise, we could be looking at two co-winners here.
There is not yet enough data to compute the final outcome. Stay tuned for the next couple of quarterly reports from AMD and NVIDIA, which will indicate the true direction of the market winds.

For struggling chip company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), 2016 is a critical year. AMD just announced the first graphics card based on its Polaris graphics architecture, a mainstream product meant to wrestle away market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Toward the end of the year, AMD is expected to launch Zen, its brand-new line of CPUs aimed at competing head-on with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
Shares of AMD have soared so far this year on the hope that the company is finally on the brink of turning itself around. But there are a few things investors need to know about AMD.

AMD data by YCharts.
AMD has posted a net loss in each of the past four years. Since 2006, the company has reported a profitable year only three times. Free cash flow has been negative in all but two years over the past decade; over the past four years, AMD's cumulative free cash flow stands at a loss of $1.22 billion.
Given this record, it shouldn't be surprising that AMD's balance sheet is not particularly strong. At the end of the first quarter, AMD's cash balance stood at $716 million, on the low end of the company's target range of $600 million to $1 billion. Total debt stood at $2.23 billion, requiring AMD to pay about $40 million in quarterly interest. The company's book value, or assets minus liabilities, is now negative $503 million, and it's been in decline for the past five years.

AMD Book Value (Quarterly) data by YCharts.
AMD's cash balance doesn't reflect two deals the company has made in recent months, so the situation isn't quite as bad as it looks. In October, the company announced a semiconductor assembly and test joint venture that will boost its cash reserves by $320 million. Another deal announced in April, in which AMD will license its x86 processor and system-on-a-chip technology to a joint venture in China, will bring in another $293 million. While these deals buy the company more time, AMD needs to return to profitability sooner rather than later.
At Computex AMD announced the Radeon RX 480, its first Polaris graphics card. While NVIDIA is following the standard pattern of launching high-end cards first and lower-end cards later, AMD is going after the mainstream market right away by pricing the RX 480 at an aggressive $199. That compares to $379 for NVIDIA's more powerful GeForce GTX 1070 and $599 for the GTX 1080.
AMD was forced to do something bold with Polaris, because the company has fallen so far behind. For the past few quarters AMD has managed a unit share of roughly 20% in the discrete graphics card market. That's down from the 40% share the company enjoyed as recently as the second quarter of 2014. NVIDIA is AMD's only competitor, and it will take a combination of competitive products and aggressive pricing to win back customers.
Eschewing the high end for the time being carries risks for AMD. The market for graphics cards has been declining in terms of units for quite some time, partly due to major improvements in integrated graphics. But the number of enthusiast card shipments doubled in 2015, according to Jon Peddie Research, and that's an area where NVIDIA dominates. AMD is going against this major trend with the RX 480, and only time will tell if the company's strategy ultimately pays off.
With Zen, AMD hopes to regain share from Intel in both the PC CPU and server CPU markets, something that will be easier said than done. In the PC market, the past few years have been unkind to AMD. According to data from PassMark Software, only about 20% of PCs in use today are powered by AMD processors, down from nearly 50% in 2006. As the PC market has contracted in recent years, AMD's position in the industry has consistently deteriorated.
Zen is supposed to bring major performance improvements that reduce or eliminate Intel's advantages. But convincing PC OEMs to offer models with AMD processors will not be easy. The average consumer looking to buy a laptop isn't checking CPU benchmarks online. The result of AMD's terrible performance in recent years has been the perception that its products are inferior to those of Intel. Even if Zen makes that untrue, changing the narrative and winning back considerable market share won't happen overnight.
AMD is in even worse shape in the server CPU market. The company's market share is basically null, and with Intel's post-PC strategy centered on cloud computing and data centers, AMD will be battling a determined foe with far greater resources. A comeback certainly isn't impossible for AMD, and even modest market-share gains would likely be viewed as a success. But the odds are not in AMD's favor.

Following NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) reveal of two high-end Pascal graphics cards in early May, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) finally unveiled the first graphics card based on its Polaris architecture during Computex. The Radeon RX 480 is a mainstream product that will be priced at just $199 when it becomes available on June 29th -- a bit more than half the price of NVIDIA's GTX 1070.
I argued in a previous article that AMD would need to launch a disruptive product in order to claw back market share from NVIDIA, and the RX 480 looks like it could fit the bill. The downside to this strategy is that AMD is handing over the lucrative high-end of the market to NVIDIA without a fight. But AMD desperately needs to regain its former position in the graphics-card industry, and going after the high-volume mainstream segment with a disruptively priced card looks like a pretty good idea.
There aren't any independent benchmarks yet, so we'll have to wait until closer to launch before getting a clear idea of how the RX 480 performs. According to AMD, the card has compute performance of more than 5 teraflops, which would put it somewhere between the last-gen R9 390 and R9 390X.
Polaris brings with it plenty of architectural improvements, though, as well as a higher memory bandwidth, and substantially lower power usage. In terms of real-world performance, somewhere in the ballpark of the 390X would probably be a safe assumption.
This means that the RX 480 will be substantially slower than NVIDIA's GTX 1070. But with the 1070 priced at $379 when it launches later this month, the gap in price between the two cards may be larger than the gap in performance. Had AMD launched a $300 card instead, I would have been concerned that the 1070 would pull PC gamers up to a higher price point, like NVIDIA managed to do with its last-gen GTX 970. But the RX 480 is going after a different demographic entirely.
AMD is pushing this new graphics card as ideal for bringing the total cost down for buying a VR-capable system. Oculus VR had previously listed NVIDIA's GTX 970 and AMD's Radeon 290 as the minimum required to run the Oculus Rift, both of which launched at well over $300. The RX 480 lowers the cost of a VR-capable PC, but that's only half the problem.
The Oculus Rift headset retails for $599, and the HTC Vive costs a whopping $799. Even if a powerful PC wasn't required, the cost of the headsets alone would prevent VR from truly going mainstream until prices come down. AMD is making a big deal of the RX 480's ability to power VR, and I don't doubt that lowering the cost of the required PC will accelerate VR's ascendance to the mainstream. But if someone's willing to shell out $599 or $799 for a VR headset, I doubt they would then turn around and skimp on the graphics card.
Until NVIDIA launches lower-end Pascal graphics cards, which will happen within the next few months if history is any indication, the RX 480 should be a no-brainer for PC gamers looking to spend no more than $200. By pricing this card so low, it will be difficult for NVIDIA to undercut AMD on price.
Having said that, there's every reason to believe that the GTX 1060, or whatever NVIDIA calls its lower-end Pascal card, will be competitive with the RX 480. Another problem for AMD: NVIDIA currently enjoys a unit share of around 80% in the graphics-card market. There's certainly some stickiness in play, especially with NVIDIA building out its software offerings like GeForce Experience; so current NVIDIA users may be less willing to switch to AMD.
Despite these issues, I expect the RX 480 to drive at least some market-share gains for AMD, assuming it performs as well as its specs suggest. What the graphics card does for the company's profitability is another question entirely, though, and the focus on enabling VR seems early, with headsets being so expensive. With NVIDIA being the undisputed leader in the high-end of the market, I doubt the RX 480 will have much of an impact on that company's financial performance.
Pricing the RX 480 at $199 is an aggressive, and likely necessary, move by AMD. The onus is now on NVIDIA to respond with a mainstream variant of Pascal.

            ","NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently launched the GTX 1080, its newest high-end graphics card. NVIDIA claims that a single GTX 1080, which costs about $600 from third-party original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), offers faster performance than two linked GeForce GTX 980s or a single Titan X. Both those setups cost around $1,000. NVIDIA also launched the less beefy GTX 1070 for $380, which is still more powerful than two linked GTX 980s or the Titan X.

Those big improvements in price and power were possible thanks to the new 16nm FinFET manufacturing process from TSMC (NYSE:TSM), which is more power efficient than the older 28nm process used in NVIDIA's older cards. It also indicates that NVIDIA plans to aggressively widen its moat against AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) lower-priced cards. 
Meanwhile, AMD is expected to unveil its latest GPU, Polaris, at Computex 2016 in Taipei next week. Those cards will come in three versions -- the Vega 10, Polaris 10, and Polaris 11 -- which will compete against NVIDIA's GTX 1070 and 1080 cards. AMD hasn't announced the official prices yet, but it has previously stated that the Polaris GPUs should cost less than $349. The Polaris GPUs were built on the 14nm FinNET process, which could be more power efficient than the 16nm one used by NVIDIA. Both NVIDIA and AMD claim that their cards are optimized for virtual reality games.
NVIDIA controlled 77% of the add-in graphics board market in the first quarter of 2016, according to research firm JPR, while AMD controlled just 23%. NVIDIA's GeForce generally has a higher level of brand recognition than AMD's Radeon, NVIDIA usually pursues architecture upgrades more aggressively, and it launches software suites and updates more frequently. 
To keep up, AMD sometimes sold its cards at lower prices and boosted the power draw of its GPUs instead of upgrading the architecture -- which produced faster but less power-efficient cards. That strategy wasn't ideal for long-term growth. Last quarter, AMD's computing and graphics revenue (which includes its CPUs and GPUs) fell 14% annually to $460 million. The unit's operating loss narrowed slightly, from $75 million a year earlier to $70 million.

AMD's development of the 14nm Polaris GPUs indicates that it doesn't plan to tread water anymore -- it wants to challenge NVIDIA's new flagship cards head-on. During last quarter's conference call (as transcribed by Thomson Reuters), CEO Lisa Su told investors that the Polaris ""delivers double the performance per watt of our current mainstream offerings, which we believe provides us with significant opportunities to gain share.""
NVIDIA's launch of the GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 indicates that it doesn't want AMD to grow its market share. By comparing the two new cards against the top-tier dual GTX 960s and Titan X setups, NVIDIA can likely attract a market of mid-range PC gamers who previously wouldn't have considered buying either $1,000 setup. 
NVIDIA's GPU business has been posting solid growth over the past few quarters. Its total GPU revenue rose 15% annually to $1.08 billion last quarter, with gaming platform revenue improving 17%, to $687 million. That boosted NVIDIA's total revenue 13%, to $1.3 billion last quarter.
NVIDIA's biggest advantage over AMD is that it has a more streamlined business model, which consists of a core GPU business and new high-growth chips for connected cars and data centers. That's why analysts expect NVIDIA's sales and earnings to respectively improve 11% and 44% this year.
AMD's GPU business is lumped together with its sluggish CPU business, which has been marginalized by market leader Intel. AMD is trying to achieve growth in GPUs with Polaris, bounce back in CPUs with Zen, blend CPUs with GPUs in its APUs, and remain in gaming consoles with its embedded chips. That's a lot of stuff to juggle as the company's bottom line remains deep in the red. 
We won't have a clear picture of how NVIDIA's newest GPUs will fare against AMD's until both cards are properly benchmarked against each other. But for now, I think NVIDIA's bigger market share and brand recognition, simpler business model, and deeper pockets for marketing blitzes could make it tough for AMD to challenge NVIDIA, even though the underdog's Polaris GPUs could be more technologically impressive.

At the moment, Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) share of the server chip market basically rounds down to zero. Rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is responsible for 99% of server chips shipped each year, a near-monopoly that has led that company to produce incredible profits in its data center business. AMD has so far completely missed out on the demand for server chips created by cloud-computing companies building out massive hyperscale data centers.
This situation could change in 2017, when AMD launches new server chips based on its upcoming Zen microarchitecture. The company is promising major performance improvements, and the move to a 14-nanometer process will help close the manufacturing gap with Intel. Things could still go wrong: Zen server chips could be delayed, or could fail to live up to the performance promises AMD has made. But it's hard to imagine AMD's position in the server chip market getting any worse.
Besting Intel won't be easy, but AMD has done it before.
In 2002, AMD was in a position similar to where it finds itself today. The company was unprofitable, forced to slash costs, and its share of the x86 server chip market was essentially zero. AMD was less diversified at that time, as it didn't acquire graphics chip company ATI until 2006, and the company still manufactured its own chips. But its position in the server market was nearly identical.
Image source: AMD.
Four years later, AMD held a roughly 26% unit share of the x86 server chip market. Intel, once viewed as an unstoppable juggernaut, was unable to fend off AMD. Opteron, a line of server chips launched by AMD in 2003, proved to be a massive success, propelling the company back to prosperity and creating a major headache for Intel.
Opteron was a 64-bit processor that could run 32-bit applications with no performance penalties, something that Intel's Xeon processors could not do at the time. Intel's high-end Itanium processors were 64-bit, but legacy 32-bit applications ran slow, and the product line was completely abandoned a few years ago after continually failing to gain much traction. Intel launched a 64-bit Xeon processor in 2004, but it would take until late 2006, when the first Xeon chip based on its Core architecture was released, before the company reclaimed the performance crown and began to eat away at AMD's market share.
Despite the similarities between 2002 and today, Zen is unlikely to repeat Opteron's massive, albeit short-lived, success. That's not to say that AMD won't win market share from Intel. But expecting the company to claim a quarter of the server chip market in a few short years is probably overly optimistic.
In 2002, it took a good product from AMD and a major misstep from Intel to fuel the former's market share gains. Intel's focus was split between Xeon and Itanium, and it allowed AMD to gain technical and performance advantages that took years for Intel to correct. In contrast, Zen is AMD's attempt to catch up to Intel in terms of performance, and it's unlikely that AMD's new chips will be clearly superior.
Server chips are also a far more important part of Intel's business today. During 2015, Intel's data center segment accounted for 29% of total revenue and 56% of operating profit. Intel didn't break out server chip sales back in 2002, but in 2009 the data center group accounted for just 18% of revenue and 40% of operating profit.
The first pillar of Intel's new post-PC strategy is the cloud, and with the data center group being its main growth engine going forward, the odds of Intel making another major misstep that opens the door for AMD is slim. If AMD's Zen server chips produce the kind of performance gains that AMD has promised, the company can certainly win back some market share from Intel. But a repeat of 2003, when Opteron upended the server chip market, is unlikely.

            ","Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently updated its investor-presentation slide deck. Although it has since been modified, the company previously included the following slide, comparing its first-generation eight-core Bulldozer-based PC processor, codenamed Orochi, to its upcoming Zen-based, eight-core Summit Ridge processor:

Image credit: AMD.
Using this slide, we can probably get some sense of how Summit Ridge will compare with Orochi. This should allow us to do a preliminary competitive comparison with Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) processors.
On the right, AMD seems to indicate that Summit Ridge will offer around twice the performance of Orochi. Note that the Y-axes aren't labeled, so the assumption that the ""Summit"" bar is twice as long as the ""Orochi"" bar is just that -- an assumption.
Further, I am going to assume that AMD's comparison refers to multithreaded performance, since such a comparison would probably put the Summit Ridge part in an ideal light.
At any rate, with the assumptions in place, we can do some work.
In the Cinebench R11.5 benchmark, a performance test that can effectively utilize many cores to render a complex 3D scene, the top Orochi chip, marketed as the FX-8150, scores 6.01 points at its default speed, per a benchmark performed by website Bit-Tech.
A straight doubling of this score would put the Summit Ridge part at around 12 points in this test.
I ran this test on my Intel Core i7-6700K. The chip is at factory default speeds of 4GHz base/4.2GHz turbo, and memory is running at DDR4-2133 speeds -- it can overclock higher, but this is the highest that Intel rates the memory controller at. I got a score of 10.20.
That means that, in this performance test, a quad-core Skylake at 4GHz base/4.2GHz turbo is around 15% slower than an eight-core Summit Ridge at unknown clock speeds.
According to Bit-Tech, the six-core Haswell-based Core i7 5820K scores around 11.7 in the same test -- about what the eight core, 16-thread AMD Summit Ridge could score. The 5820K has six cores, rather than the four cores in my 6700K chip, but the cores themselves come out of the box at much lower frequencies, so per-core performance is much lower, but there are two more cores to pick up the slack.
AMD's Zen CPU core, should it hit its performance targets, will be a much worthier adversary to Intel's current processor cores than AMD's current processors are.
Indeed, if we use Cinebench R11.5 as a proxy for multicore performance, then I would guess that AMD's upcoming Summit Ridge chip will be about as fast as the current six-core Intel Core i7-5820K -- a $390 part -- in multi-threaded workloads.
This would suggest that Intel's per-core performance is better, but thanks to AMD's throwing in more cores, it should be able to offer up similar multicore performance.
From a business perspective, AMD's current best high-end desktop chip sells for around $199. Assuming that Intel doesn't dramatically change its product stack between now and the launch of Summit Ridge, AMD would be in a position to charge, perhaps, $299 for the top Summit Ridge part -- a significant boost in selling price.
At around $340, Intel will be able to offer a part with better one- to four-core performance, though in workloads that can use eight cores, the AMD part should come out on top. And I expect that at $389, Intel will offer up a six-core Broadwell-E part with roughly similar multicore performance but better single-core performance.
I don't think AMD is going to put out ""Intel-killer"" parts, but I do think Summit Ridge has the potential to improve AMD's competitive positioning in the enthusiast desktop market.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) appears to be in the midst of a turnaround. Over the last one-year period, AMD stock has increased nearly 65% versus the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index's (NASDAQ:SOXX) loss of nearly 9%. Against its biggest GPU competitor, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), however, AMD stock underperformed during this period. 

AMD data by YCharts.
For AMD, less bad news has been good news. Although the company beat top-line analyst expectations by posting $832 million in revenue, this was 19% lower than last year's corresponding quarter. On a divisional basis, AMD's revenue decrease (first quarter 2016 compared with first quarter 2015) was broad based with a 14% decrease in computing and graphics, and a 25% decrease in the company's smaller enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business. AMD shares surged 10% after first-quarter earnings when management guided for second-half profitability (non-GAAP).
One of the opportunities for AMD has been simply to win back market share in discrete GPUs. After years of enjoying a 60/40-split with NVIDIA taking the larger share, AMD now only claims roughly 20% of the discrete graphics card market. The company hopes its newest graphics architecture will improve the company's fortunes.
AMD is going with a different strategy Perhaps AMD doesn't have to win back market share from NVIDIA on a significant basis in order for investors to be rewarded. The company stated it would launch its new Polaris GPU architecture in ""mid-2016,"" with the rumors suggesting, specifically, June at Computex. Instead of attempting to compete with NVIDIA's Pascal in the high end, AMD is focusing its efforts on mainstream users. AMD's Corporate Vice President of Alliances, Content and VR, Roy Taylor discussed this with ARS Technica.
The reason Polaris is a big deal is because I believe we will be able to grow that TAM [total addressable market] significantly. I don't think NVIDIA is going to do anything to increase the TAM, because according to everything we've seen around Pascal, it's a high-end part. I don't know what the price is gonna be, but let's say it's as low as 500-600 [pounds] and as high as 800-1000 [pounds]. That price range is not going to expand the TAM for VR. We're going on the record right now to say Polaris will expand the TAM. Full stop.
Since then, NVIDIA confirmed it will introduce a lower-spec Pascal-powered GeForce GTX 1070 in June at a $379 price point. It was always a pipe dream for AMD to think NVIDIA would totally concede the low/mid-range market, but Taylor's bullishness points to a low-cost, value-driven product that will grow the VR market.
Gaming and VR may help AMD continue its run Over the next few years, virtual reality will most likely be a huge catalyst to NVIDIA, AMD, or both. Current Facebook-owned VR company Oculus names NVIDIA's GTX 970 and AMD's R9 290 video graphics as entry-level cards for virtual-reality functionality. The industry should witness a huge upgrade cycle for gamers seeking to add VR to their gaming experience. AMD doesn't need to significantly grow market share in order to benefit from this shift.
Overall, gaming should boost AMD's fortunes for the intermediate future. CEO Lisa Su guided for 15% revenue growth in the second fiscal quarter, pointing to the company's system-on-a-chip, or SOC, business as the driver for returns. Typically, AMD's SOC business is limited to gaming consoles, with speculation that Sony's next-gen Neo version of the PlayStation will be one of the consoles. If the company can deliver on promises then it's possible for the stock to continue to power higher.

Sometime soon, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is expected to officially unveil its newest graphics cards built on the Polaris graphics architecture. With Polaris, AMD is making a bid to reclaim its position in the graphics card industry. Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has run away with the market in recent years, leaving AMD with a unit market share of about 20%. That's down from 40% just two short years ago.
NVIDIA has already shown its hand, announcing two high-end graphics cards based on its new Pascal graphics architecture earlier this month. NVIDIA-provided benchmarks show major performance and efficiency improvements compared to the cards that the new GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 are replacing. Both Pascal and Polaris cards will be built on advanced 14/16nm FinFET manufacturing processes.
While NVIDIA is following the typical pattern of introducing high-end parts first and filling in the rest of the lineup later, AMD is taking the opposite approach with Polaris. There will be two Polaris GPUs, Polaris 10 and Polaris 11, and neither will be focused on the high-end desktop graphics market. Polaris 11 is targeting the mainstream notebook market, and Polaris 10 will go after the mainstream desktop and the high-end notebook market.
AMD's strategy is a risky gambit. On the one hand, most of the volume in the graphics card market comes from mainstream cards. With mainstream Pascal cards yet to be announced, Polaris will be competing with last-gen NVIDIA products, a situation that could lead to meaningful gains in market share.
On the other hand, the graphics card market is moving in the exact opposite direction, and AMD risks ceding the lucrative high-end graphics market to NVIDIA for another product generation.
Despite the weak PC market, NVIDIA has managed to grow its GPU revenue in recent quarters. In 2015, revenue from GPUs, which include gaming GPUs as well as enterprise and data center GPUs, rose 9% compared to 2014. Gaming revenue has been growing even faster for NVIDIA, jumping 25% year over year during the fourth quarter. A portion of this growth was due to NVIDIA's winning market share from AMD. But a shift toward high-end graphics cards was also a contributing factor.
According to Jon Peddie Research, the market for discrete graphics cards has been shrinking for quite some time. Unit shipments of add-in boards peaked at 114 million in 1999, falling to 65 million by 2013. The decline continued during the fourth quarter of 2015, with total discrete GPU shipments slumping about 7% year over year. A weak PC market and integrated graphics improving dramatically in recent years have been the main drivers of this decline.
While the discrete GPU market is declining in terms of volume, the enthusiast portion of the market is thriving. In 2015, shipments of enthusiast graphics cards doubled to 5.9 million units. Much of this increase, I suspect, was due to NVIDIA's GTX 970, a graphics card launched in late 2014 for $329 that has been a massive success for the company. Despite its high price, the GTX 970 is by far the most popular discrete graphics card in use on the Steam PC gaming platform.
AMD's plan to focus on the mainstream GPU market comes at a time when the market is clearly shifting toward the high end. NVIDIA was able to pull PC gamers to higher price points in 2015 with the GTX 970, and the company is looking to do it again with the GTX 1070 this year. If all of AMD's Polaris graphics cards are priced below the GTX 1070, the company will need to offer compelling performance in order to prevent the same thing from happening this time around.
AMD's bet on mainstream graphics could backfire if Polaris falls short of expectations. The GTX 1070 is a bit more expensive than its predecessor, with an MSRP of $379, which gives AMD some breathing room on price. The latest rumors point to AMD shooting for a price point below $299 for Polaris 10.
If Polaris 10 delivers enough performance at that price, the GTX 1070 may not have the same success as the GTX 970 did before it. But if AMD can't give PC gamers a good reason to choose its new cards over NVIDIA's higher-end offering, market share gains may be minimal for the struggling company.

Graphics processor specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported results on Thursday night, covering the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. In after-market trading, investors reacted to the report with an instant share-price boost of more than 7%.

Sales exceeded the top-end of management's guidance for the quarter. GAAP earnings were expected to stop at roughly $190 million. The company enjoyed strong sales growth in three out of five reportable business segments, as products based on the long-awaited Pascal architecture started rolling out.
Looking ahead, management offered the following guidance for the second quarter.
Co-founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang celebrated NVIDIA's strong position in several interesting growth markets.
""Accelerating our growth is deep learning, a new computing model that uses the GPU's massive computing power to learn artificial intelligence algorithms. Its adoption is sweeping one industry after another, driving demand for our GPUs,"" Huang said in a press statement. ""Our new Pascal GPU architecture will give a giant boost to deep learning, gaming and VR.""
The Pascal products are said to be in ""full production,"" ready to hit store shelves and distributors later this month. NVIDIA says that the new products are twice as fast as the current line of Titan X flagship, and uses one-third as much wall power. And the Pascal line will be sold at half the price of Titan X.
While we await independent reviews, we can only go by NVIDIA's own word at this point. Delivering on these promises would be game changing, taking the wind out of arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) sails; that is, unless AMD's upcoming Polaris architecture can match Polaris blow for blow.
Meanwhile, NVIDIA is riding plenty high on older products as shown by the dramatic wins in data-center and automotive sales.

            ","Troubled chip company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) hopes to turn things around in 2016. The company is close to launching new graphics cards, with the goal of winning back some market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). On the CPU front, AMD plans to launch the first round of its Zen CPUs later this year. Big performance gains could help the company erase the advantage Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) products have held for years.
Neither of these efforts are guaranteed to be successful, and if one or both fail, a turnaround at AMD may not materialize at all. To get a better understanding of where AMD stands today, here are three charts investors need to see.
The last year in which AMD turned a profit was 2011. Share losses in the CPU and GPU markets, as well as a prolonged slump in PC sales, are mostly to blame. AMD's successful semi-custom business, which supplies the major game consoles with SoCs, has been a bright spot for the company. But it hasn't been enough to offset losses related to PCs.
AMD's revenue hit a low point in 2015, and despite the company's optimism that it would return to non-GAAP profitability during the second half of last year, the net loss was the largest in three years.

Data source: Morningstar.
AMD expects to grow revenue in 2016, driven by additional semi-custom design wins that will begin to generate revenue during the second half as well as the launch of its Polaris graphics cards. The company also expects to generate a non-GAAP operating profit during the second half of the year. While AMD will almost certainly still post a net loss in 2016, the worst would be over if this guidance is hit. So far, there's been little evidence to suggest that AMD's turnaround is making any progress at all. If all goes according to plan, the second half of this year will finally offer proof that the company's strategy is working.
Two years ago, AMD shipped about 40% of all discrete graphics cards. NVIDIA shipped the remaining 60%, but the two companies were both strong players in the industry. This market share split had remained roughly the same for years up until late 2014.
Things changed when NVIDIA launched the GTX 970 and GTX 980 in September of 2014. The GTX 970, disruptively priced, rose to become the most popular graphics card used by PC gamers on the Steam platform. AMD's market share began to slump, and the launch of its own high-end Fury graphics cards last year failed to do much to change the situation. By the fourth quarter of 2015, NVIDIA claimed around 80% of the market by units.

Data source: Jon Peddie Research.
AMD is banking on its upcoming Polaris graphics cards to claw back market share, but NVIDIA has new products of its own. The company announced the first two graphics cards based on its Pascal architecture earlier this month, and the performance and efficiency gains are impressive. AMD will need to launch disruptive products in order to have any chance of returning to growth this year.
Based on AMD's performance over the past few years, it's safe to say the company has been losing market share in the PC CPU market to Intel. A decade ago, AMD was a strong player in the market, with products that were competitive with those offered by Intel. Today, that's simply not the case.
Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform, keeps track of what type of CPU its users own. While these numbers aren't representative of the PC market as a whole, the decline in AMD's presence on Steam over the past few years is substantial.

Data source: Steam.
AMD made some major mistakes with its Bulldozer CPUs launched in 2011. Single-threaded performance was abysmal compared to comparable Intel products, and various revisions didn't help. Zen, AMD's upcoming CPU microarchitecture, aims to solve this problem. AMD has promised a 40% boost in instructions-per-clock, and the company is moving to a 14nm manufacturing process. Both of these changes should help AMD close the gap with Intel in terms of performance.
There's a lot riding on Zen, and if AMD comes up short, a turnaround will be a lot more difficult to imagine. AMD has a history of over-promising and under-delivering, but the company needs to hit it out of the park this year.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has a plan to return to growth this year. It's an optimistic plan, and the company has a history of coming up well short of its own expectations. But investors seem to be on board with AMD's guidance, evidenced by the stock recently surging to levels not seen since 2014.
AMD's success this year depends on Polaris, its upcoming graphics architecture. The company is expected to officially announce new graphics cards based on Polaris as early as this month. Major improvements in performance and efficiency are expected, in part due to the move to a 14-nanometer manufacturing process. AMD's graphics card unit market share currently sits at about 20%, cut in half since early 2014, and the company is banking on Polaris to regain its former position in the industry.

Image source: NVIDIA.
Regaining substantial market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be easier said than done. NVIDIA announced the first two graphics cards based on its Pascal graphics architecture on May 6. The GTX 1080, priced at $599 and available on May 27, replaces the GTX 980 and is more powerful and more efficient than the Titan X, NVIDIA's most powerful last-gen graphics card. The card sports 8 GB of high-speed GDDR5X memory, which provides more bandwidth than the standard GDDR5 memory used in most graphics cards.
NVIDIA claims that the GTX 1080 more than doubles the performance of the GTX 980 in certain virtual reality applications. In standard PC games, NVIDIA-provided benchmarks put the gain at around 1.5 to 1.75. Independent benchmarks aren't yet available, but it's clear that the GTX 1080 offers a major jump in performance.
The second Pascal graphics card, the GTX 1070, is more affordable. It replaces the GTX 970 and will be priced at $379 when it launches on June 10. The GTX 970 was a runaway hit for NVIDIA, with the card rising to be the most popular among Steam users. While the GTX 1070 is priced a bit higher than the GTX 970, the performance gains should be substantial.

Image source: AMD.
According to AMD's first-quarter earnings report, Polaris won't focus on the high end of the market, at least initially. Two versions, Polaris 10 and Polaris 11, will target the notebook market and the mainstream desktop market, with the goal being to enable virtual reality applications at mainstream price points. We won't know for sure until AMD officially announces its new products, but NVIDIA's GTX 1080 may not have a new competitor at all.
AMD's focus on the mainstream may simply be an issue of resources. NVIDIA claims that developing Pascal required billions of dollars of research and development spending, with several thousand people working on the project for over two years. NVIDIA's R&D spending has ramped up over the past few years, with about $1.3 billion spent in fiscal 2016. That compares to just $950 million spent by AMD, spread across both GPU and CPU development. AMD has slashed R&D spending in recent years as the company has struggled with growing losses.
With NVIDIA focusing on the high end of the market, AMD's strategy could work out well if Polaris delivers enough performance at a low enough price to capture PC gamers who would have otherwise opted for the GTX 1070. But the market for VR headsets is very young, and AMD specifically targeting VR with mainstream graphics cards could backfire. The Oculus Rift costs $599, expensive enough that it likely prices out the majority of PC gamers. Those willing to pay such a high price for a VR headset are probably willing to pay a higher price for a graphics card as well, instead of settling for a mainstream part.
NVIDIA will no doubt launch mainstream Pascal graphics cards in the coming months. The GTX 960 came about four months after the GTX 980 and GTX 970 were announced, so new Pascal cards sometime this year is a good bet. AMD will also likely launch higher-end cards at some point in the future.
The wait for Polaris is almost over. AMD has made big promises, and its ability to hit its guidance this year depends on Polaris winning back market share from NVIDIA. For that to happen, AMD's new graphics cards need to offer compelling price-to-performance ratios. A lackluster launch, like the 2015 release of the Fury X, would be a disaster. AMD needs to be disruptive, like NVIDIA was in 2014 with the GTX 970. Anything short of that would likely lead to another disappointing year for AMD.

Of all the chip stocks our market has to offer, arguably no two well-known names could be in quite as different a position as video processing chip specialist Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) and graphics chip company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). But these two companies also have more in common than you might think.
But before we get there, I can't help wondering: Which is the better buy today?
On one hand, Ambarella stock has fallen nearly 50% over the past year and sits more than 70% below its 52-week-high, given ongoing weakness in its core wearable-camera segment. Most recently, Ambarella shares plunged more than 7% in a single day last week, after key customer GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) told investors that revenue in its most recent quarter declined a whopping 49.5% from the same year-ago period. Putting aside the fact that the decline was better than GoPro expected, Ambarella's guilt by association seemed fair enough at first glance; GoPro has previously represented as much as 30% of Ambarella's total revenue, so it stands to reason that Ambarella should continue to suffer as long as the action camera maker's sales remain depressed. 
As I researched the biggest threats to Ambarella for an article last month, however, I realized this concern might prove unfounded. Recall, for example, that during its most recent earnings conference call two months ago, Ambarella management revealed that GoPro's high inventories had already caused demand from GoPro to decline to the low-single-digit range as a percentage of overall revenue. As a result, Ambarella opted to take a conservative approach in accounting for wearables revenue in issuing guidance -- which calls for revenue to decline in the range of 24% to 20% year over year for the current quarter -- despite what management described as ""strong sales"" from supplemental markets, including IP security, automotive aftermarket, home monitoring, and flying cameras.
For perspective, that disappointing guidance was the primary reason Ambarella shares also plunged after the company's quarterly report in March. As such, it appears to me that Ambarella's latest GoPro-induced decline was nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction that had already been priced in after the company's latest outlook. If Ambarella's other markets continue to show promise as it diversifies away from the wearable market -- and keeping in mind that wearables could see a rebound if GoPro introduces its new HERO 5 camera line in time for the holidays -- Ambarella could be poised for a fast and furious rebound.
On the other hand, Advanced Micro Devices stock is up nearly 60% over the past year, driven most recently by a 38% single-day pop two weeks ago on the heels of the company's better-than-expected first-quarter results.
But that's also not to say AMD's results were impressive on the surface. Similar to Ambarella's impending performance, AMD's revenue declined 19.2% in the first quarter, to $832 million, and resulted in an adjusted net loss of $96 million, or $0.12 per share. AMD management primarily blamed lower sales of semi-custom SoCs and client notebook processors for the declines, extending past concerns that had left the stock depressed in the first place. However, Wall Street was even less optimistic going in to the announcement, with analysts' consensus estimates predicting lower revenue of $818.2 million, and a wider adjusted loss of $0.13 per share. 
If that relative outperformance wasn't enough, AMD also revealed a new $293 million milestone-based agreement to license its processor and SoC technology to a newly created joint venture with China-based Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., Ltd., which will develop SoCs tailored to the Chinese Server market that serve to complement AMD's existing products. AMD also suggested it will receive additional royalties from the JV's future product sales.
In addition, AMD offered surprisingly strong guidance for revenue in the second quarter in the range of $931.8 million to $981.8 million, the midpoint of which represents modest year-over-year growth of 1.6%, and sat significantly higher than analysts' expectations for revenue to decline 5.6% year over year. For this, AMD management largely credited three new semi-custom SoC design wins -- a move many industry watchers see as a hint that AMD's semi-custom chips will appear once again in all three major gaming console providers' next-gen systems.
At the same time, however, I'm also unsettled that AMD still operates at a loss, even after adjusting for one-time items that tend to skew comparable results. By contrast, even as its sales remain under pressure, Ambarella has still managed to remain profitable on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. 
And as fellow Fool Tim Green pointed out recently, these deals alone won't be enough to push AMD into the black in the second half of this year, leaving some of the onus on taking back significant graphics-card share from NVIDIA. Considering NVIDIA just launched two new highly coveted gaming graphics cards based on its Pascal architecture this week, and last quarter commanded nearly 80% of the graphics card market in terms of units shipped, I fear this may prove too great a challenge for AMD to overcome. If that proves to be the case, AMD's recent jump could be short-lived.
So in the end, given what I believe is the market's overdone response to Ambarella's near-term struggles and the prospects of a turnaround, I'm convinced Ambarella is the better buy today.

            ","Many companies consider virtual reality to be the next frontier for hardware and software growth. Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital claims that the fledgling market will grow from practically nothing today to a $30 billion market by 2020, while Goldman Sachs estimates that the market could be worth $80 billion by 2025.

To tap into that growth, many investors are seeking out companies with exposure to VR hardware and software. The most obvious choice is Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), which sells the Oculus Rift, but sales of the headset and its related software will likely only account for a single-digit percentage of the company's sales this year. Facebook also isn't cheap, with a trailing P/E of 72 in an industry that generally trades around 32 times earnings. Therefore, let's look beyond the Oculus Rift to find two cheaper and more meaningful ways to invest in the VR market.
AMDShares of AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) have fallen nearly 90% over the past decade, due to the loss of both x86 chips to Intel and high-end graphics cards to Nvidia. However, shares rallied more than 50% over the past 12 months on hopes that the company can turn its business around.
AMD considers VR to be a big part of that strategy. Its APUs combine CPUs with GPUs on a single chip, making them ideal all-in-one solutions for devices that require major graphical processing horsepower in slimmer packages. Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One both use AMD's semi-custom, low-power APUs, which are sold through its EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) business. These APUs will likely be used in stand-alone VR headsets in the future -- and here AMD has a clear advantage over Nvidia because it dominates the market for custom APUs.
On the PC front, AMD has worked with PC manufacturers to create ""Oculus Ready"" PCs designed to meet the high requirements for Rift gaming. Selling add-in boards into these rigs could boost AMD's market share against Nvidia. On the software end, AMD offers LiquidVR, a suite of technologies that reduces delays (latency) in VR image processing, which can cause motion sickness. Several partners, including Facebook's Oculus and HTC, have already integrated LiquidVR into their devices and software.

AMD stock only trades at 0.7 times trailing sales, compared to the industry average P/S ratio of 1.9. That makes it fundamentally cheap. The chipmaker's sales are still declining, and it isn't profitable -- but its new Polaris GPU, Zen x86 chips, and custom SoCs for new consoles could turn things around.
SonySony stock has fallen more than 20% over the past 12 months due to slowdowns in its smartphone and camera businesses, a brand-tarnishing cyber attack on Sony Pictures, and a general downturn in Japanese stocks. However, Sony's gaming business remained strong, posting 12% sales growth in fiscal 2015 and accounting for nearly a fifth of the company's top line. The unit's operating income growth of 84% also helped Sony post its first full year of profits in three years. That growth was driven by robust sales of PS4 hardware and software.
Looking ahead into the rest of 2016, VR could boost the gaming unit's sales in two ways. First, Sony will launch its PlayStation VR headset for the PS4 in October. The stand-alone headset will cost $399, while a bundle (including two Move controllers, headphones, the PS Camera, a game, and a demo disc) will cost $500. Combined with the $350 PS4, the PlayStation VR will likely be the cheapest ""high end"" VR experience, available for $850. The Rift, by comparison, costs $600 and requires a PC which costs around $1,000.

Second, Sony is expected to refresh the PS4 with the ""PS4.5/NEO"" hardware update, which should add 4K support and better support for PlayStation VR games. If Sony convinces enough gamers to buy both the PlayStation VR and the PS4.5/NEO, its gaming business could get a healthy boost in hardware sales. If the gaming unit continues to drive bottom line growth, Sony stock might bounce back as the VR market matures.
But the VR market has a lot to proveAMD and Sony will benefit if the VR market's growth meets industry expectations. However, the market could also struggle to grow beyond hardcore gamers if efforts to reach more mainstream users -- like Facebook and YouTube's 360-degree videos -- fall short of expectations. High price tags for first generation VR headsets could also throttle the market's growth. 
Therefore, investors shouldn't buy AMD or Sony simply because they are exposed to the VR market. Instead, they should only invest if they believe that their core businesses can still grow -- with or without VR. That being said, these two stocks are a great way to incorporate VR into a portfolio for a fair price.

            ","With the PC market in decline, both Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are feeling the pain. Global PC shipments dropped 9.8% in 2013, 2.1% in 2014, and 10.4% in 2015, driven by a combination of factors including the rise of mobile devices and the failure of Windows 10 to trigger an upgrade cycle. 2016 isn't off to a better start, with global PC shipments slumping 11.5% year over year during the first quarter.
Both AMD and Intel are still heavily dependent on the PC market, although both companies are working to change that. AMD has built up its semi-custom chip business, with its SoCs powering the major game consoles, and the company plans to make a run at the server chip market next year with its upcoming Zen CPUs. Intel dominates that market, with the company's server chip business acting as a source of both growth and outsize profits, partially offsetting PC-related weakness.
With both AMD and Intel facing considerable challenges, which is the better buy?
The case for AMD

Image source: AMD.
A quick look at AMD's financial statements reveals that the company is in serious trouble. Revenue dropped 28% in 2015 driven by a weak PC market, share losses to Intel, and share losses to NVIDIA in the graphics card market. The company posted a $660 million net loss on $3.99 billion of revenue, the fourth annual loss in a row. AMD's book value, or assets minus liabilities, turned negative.
The company expects this year to mark the turning point of its efforts to turn the business around. AMD's guidance calls for a return to revenue growth, driven by new semi-custom design wins and the upcoming launch of its Polaris graphics cards. Non-GAAP operating profitability is expected to return during the second half of the year, a massive improvement over 2015.
AMD provided similarly optimistic guidance last year, but the company came up far short and was forced to abandon those targets just a few months later. I don't fully trust AMD's guidance for that reason. But if Polaris is a success, and if Zen, which launches for PCs toward the end of this year and for servers next year, follows suit, AMD stock could be worth far more than it trades for today. The company sports a market capitalization of just $2.8 billion, down more than 80% over the past decade. A return to profitability in 2017 or 2018 would likely send the stock soaring.
What makes AMD stock risky is the chance that something goes wrong. NVIDIA currently dominates the graphics card market, shipping around 80% of cards during the fourth quarter last year, and its upcoming Pascal graphics cards are set to launch in the same timeframe as Polaris. If Polaris fails to win back meaningful market share from NVIDIA, AMD's guidance could again prove to be overly optimistic. AMD stock has plenty of upside potential, but it comes with plenty of risk as well.
The case for Intel

Image source: Intel.
Intel investors have been subject to a parade of bad news in recent weeks. First, the company announced plans to lay off up to 12,000 employees, or roughly 11% of its global workforce, by the middle of next year in an effort to adjust to lower demand for PCs. Second, Intel announced it is essentially giving up on the mobile market, at least for the time being, by axing its SoFIA and Broxton chips.
With the PC market showing no signs of turning around, Intel expects its data center and Internet of Things businesses to be the key growth drivers for the company going forward. During 2015, the data center segment generated $7.85 billion of operating profit, nearly as much as the client computing segment, while growing revenue by 11%. The rapid rise of cloud computing has been a boon for the company, with Intel enjoying a near-monopoly in the server chip market.
The bad news is that competition is coming. AMD will launch new server chips in 2017, potentially winning back some market share, and initiatives from International Business Machines and ARM Holdings to create viable alternatives in the data center are slowly gaining momentum. Earlier this month, Alphabet's Google announced that it was working to develop a server architecture based on IBM's POWER chips, a move that could mark the beginning of the end of Intel's uncontested data center dominance.
There are a lot of headwinds working against Intel at the moment, but the company is still very profitable. During 2015, Intel generated net income of $11.4 billion, putting the P/E ratio of the stock at about 12.8. With that valuation, investors aren't betting on much growth for Intel going forward.
Still, if the PC market eventually stabilizes and Intel manages to fight off encroaching competition in the data center segment, Intel would likely be able to maintain its profitability. And potential growth areas like the Internet of Things and 3D XPoint memory could drive earnings higher in the long run. Intel's growth story isn't dead, but earnings growth is no longer a foregone conclusion, and a substantial earnings decline is possible if things don't go Intel's way.
Which is the better buy? Neither AMD nor Intel look like particularly attractive investments at this point. AMD has more upside potential, but the company needs to deliver with its upcoming product launches, something it's had problems with in the past. Intel has an attractive valuation assuming earnings don't decline, but the company is facing major headwinds as PC sales slump and its efforts in mobile fizzle.
Intel is the safer bet, simply because the company is wildly profitable and enjoys some significant competitive advantages. AMD has the potential to soar, but it also has the potential to crash and burn if Polaris and Zen come up short. For most investors, Intel looks like the better buy, despite the myriad problems facing the company.

Don't look now, but Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has surged in the past year: Versus the Nasdaq Composite's 5% loss over that time, AMD is up approximately 60%. The vast majority of AMD's overperformance is due to the company's first-quarter results, reported last month, where the company beat analyst expectations on the top line by posting $832 million, beating analyst expectations by $13.8 million.
However, long-term investors are still disappointed with the company's performance as shares of AMD are down nearly 60% over the past five years. The stock has struggled over that period in the face of a slowing PC industry and competition from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU business. For example, although AMD exceeded analyst expectations in the most recent quarter, revenue still fell 19.2% from last year's corresponding quarter and it reported a per-share loss of $0.14.
Can AMD reverse its performance? In the company's computing and graphics business, revenue fell 14%. While AMD has been faulted for poor execution, this loss reflects a poor computer market more than AMD's company-specific failures. Last quarter, Gartner reported that PC sales fell 9.6% on a year-on-year basis.
However, there is one potential growth driver on the horizon: virtual reality. For full VR functionality, Facebook's Oculus device, currently considered the most developed ecosystem, specifically recommends NVIDIA's GTX 970 or AMD's R9 290 PC graphics cards. Although AMD has lost considerable market share in GPUs to NVIDIA over the past few years, a rising tide in virtual-reality personal gaming could lift both boats.
Will Nintendo and Sony add to gains? Last quarter, the company struggled in its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom division. On a year-on-year basis, sales decreased by 25%. While AMD's computing and graphics division is larger, investors watch AMD's enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business because the division is more profitable.

As a comparison, the commoditized computing and graphics business reported an operating loss of $70 million on $460 million in revenue in the first quarter, whereas enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom businesses reported a gain of $16 million on $372 million in revenue. For AMD investors, growth in enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom sales should be watched, as it's currently AMD's profitable division.
In AMD's recent earnings call, CEO Lisa Su noted that the company expected revenue to increase 15% sequentially in the second quarter because of strong demand for semi-custom unit shipments. Su was somewhat secretive, but did credit semi-custom system-on-a-chip design wins as adding $1.5 billion in revenue over the next three or four years. Though it's unconfirmed, tech site ARS Technica cites leaks that Nintendo's new NX gaming console and Sony's PlayStation NEO refresh are likely to be among these wins.
In the long run, AMD could benefit from a shift toward virtual-reality processing and gaming, both of which could increase demand for the company's graphics cards. While the company is waiting for this longer-term catalyst to develop, the company should benefit from gaming SOCs. AMD still faces headwinds, but there are positive catalysts in the offing.

It's finally happening. After years of struggling with a weak PC market and share losses to both Intel and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) expects its turnaround efforts to pay off during the second half of the year. AMD's guidance calls for revenue growth in 2016, along with a return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second half. All of those qualifiers before the word profitability means that AMD will still almost certainly post a net loss, but hitting this guidance would mark a vast improvement compared to the second half of 2015. Shares of AMD exploded higher when the company unveiled this guidance along with its first-quarter report.

AMD data by YCharts.
But AMD investors may be counting their chickens before they hatch. When I first read AMD's guidance, I was overcome with a sense of deja vu. This all seemed very familiar. It turns out that the company provided very similar guidance last year, only to abandon those targets a few months later. Given AMD's history of overly optimistic outlooks, I just don't trust the company's guidance.
A guidance disaster AMD held an analyst day event in May 2015 where the company outlined its strategy and provided its outlook for the rest of the year. AMD expected great things during the second half 2015, including revenue growth, a non-GAAP net profit, and positive free cash flow. Here's a rundown of its guidance for the second half of 2015:
Item
Guidance
Revenue
Up 15% +/- 3% from first half
Gross margin
32% to 34%
Net income
Positive
Cash
$800 million to $1 billion
Free cash flow
Positive
All figures except revenue and cash non-GAAP. Data source: AMD 2015 analyst day presentation.
Unfortunately for AMD, the PC market performed far worse than the company expected. During AMD's Q2 2015 earnings conference call, less than three months after the analyst day event, the company was forced to abandon this outlook, with CFO Devinder Kumar stating that the goal of profitability had been pushed back.
Here's are AMD's actual results for the second half of 2015.
Item
Guidance
Revenue
Up 2.3% from first half
Gross margin
25.9%
Net income
($215 million)
Cash
$785 million
Free cash flow
($63 million)
All figures except revenue and cash non-GAAP. Source: AMD Q3 & Q4 2015 earnings reports .
Revenue barely grew compared to the first half, both free cash flow and net income were soundly negative, and the company's cash balance fell below the low end of its guidance. AMD wasn't even in the ballpark.
Will it be different this time around? AMD's 2015 guidance assumed that the PC market would improve, driven by the release of Windows 10. That didn't happen. This year, AMD is working under the assumption that the PC market will continue to be weak. That makes the company more likely to hit its guidance this time around, with less room for a negative surprise when it comes to PC sales.
AMD will get a revenue boost during the second half thanks to the ramping of revenue from additional semi-custom design wins that the company has previously announced. These three deals are expected to generate around $1.5 billion of total revenue over the course of the next three to four years. AMD didn't say exactly how much revenue will be recognized from these deals this year, only that it will take time to ramp.
These deals alone won't be enough push AMD into the black during the second half. AMD pointed to graphics as the second area responsible for its second half expectations. New graphics cards based on Polaris, AMD's upcoming graphics architecture, are set to launch in the next few months, and AMD will be aiming to win back considerable market share from NVIDIA. During the fourth quarter of 2015, AMD shipped just 21.1% of graphics cards, leaving NVIDIA with the lion's share of the market. Historically, AMD's share has been closer to 40%.
NVIDIA will be launching new graphics cards of its own this year, based on its upcoming Pascal architecture, so there's no guarantee that Polaris will be a big enough success for AMD to hit its guidance. Polaris will reportedly be focused on the mainstream market, according to Ars Technica, a move which could leave NVIDIA unchallenged at the high end.
I think AMD has a better chance of hitting its guidance this year than it did last year, especially given the additional semi-custom revenue. But AMD's business has proven to be very difficult to predict, and both the PC market and AMD's ability to regain graphics share remain wild cards. If AMD manages to hit its guidance for the second half, it would be the first real sign that the core business is turning around. But I would take the company's guidance with a grain of salt.

In the graphics processing world, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) lead the pack. Both have essentially cornered the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, and their pursuits have paid off substantially for investors over the past few years.
Take a look at their stock prices over the past 12 months: 
Data source: YCharts.
NVIDIA has focused its attention on how best to use its GPU skills in new markets, and it appears to be paying off. In fiscal Q4 2016, the company's revenue hit a record high of $1.4 billion and for the full fiscal 2015, an increase of 12% year over year. Meanwhile, AMD's Q1 2016 revenues were $832 million, falling 19% year over year.
It's not just NVIDIA's revenues that are outpacing AMD's -- it's also its GPU market share. A few years ago, NVIDIA held 64% of the discrete desktop GPU market share and AMD took about 36%. But over the past few years, NVIDIA has started to make more gains, rising to over 76%, while AMD has fallen to below 24%. 
Part of NVIDIA's rise comes from the expansion of its GPU expertise. The company not only uses its GPUs in desktops but in computers for driverless cars and virtual reality (VR) as well. The company's GeForce GTX 970 and 980 GPUs are the leading graphics processors for computers that can run high-end VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. 
The VR-ready desktop market is still very niche right now, representing about 1% of all PCs on the market. By 2018, though, there are expected to be about 171 million VR users worldwide, and the market size will grow to $70 billion by 2020. 
NVIDIA is also using its Tesla graphics processors to help power its new DGX-1 supercomputer. The server will be used for a variety of high-powered calculations, including crunching data for driverless cars from the cloud.
To its credit, some of AMD's latest Radeon GPUs are in several VR-ready computers as well. The company is positioned to benefit from VR's growth just as NVIDIA is, but with its discrete GPU market share far behind NVIDIA's, AMD won't benefit to the same degree.
However, AMD is making some big gains with its server processors and recently announced a $293 million partnership with China's Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment. That's an important win for AMD because of the growing Chinese server market. 
AMD could also benefit from Intel's recent announcement that it'll be moving away from the PC market to higher growth segments. AMD may be able to gain some PC wins as Intel shifts directions, but it'll take some time to see if that really pays off.  
So who wins?Both companies clearly have their strong suits, but I think NVIDIA is a better buy right now because of the new market segments it's pursuing. There are projected to be 12 million driverless car sales annually by 2035, according to IHS Automotive, and NVIDIA's technology is helping to push that market forward in ways AMD just can't match. 
Similarly, VR's growth over the coming years should bring in additional revenue for both companies, but NVIDIA's dominant position in GPU market share gives it the clear advantage in the space. 
AMD may be expanding further into servers and PC processors, but just as Intel has shown, betting on the PC market is a losing battle. I think NVIDIA's pursuits have better long-term potential, and that's why I'd choose it right now.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been beaten down in recent years, and for good reason. The company has struggled to compete in both the CPU and GPU markets, leading to slumping revenue and four consecutive years of losses. AMD's first-quarter earnings report wasn't pretty, but optimistic guidance and news of a joint venture in China sent shares soaring.
Beyond the numbers, AMD's management team provided additional details for investors during the company's earnings conference call. Here are five quotes from AMD's management, taken from the conference call transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.
Polaris is near AMD has lost considerable share in the discrete graphics card market to rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past couple of years. During the fourth quarter of 2015, AMD shipped just 21.1% of discrete graphics cards, with NVIDIA accounting for the rest, according to Jon Peddie Research. Two years ago, AMD's market share was roughly 40%, with NVIDIA enjoying only a modest lead.
AMD is betting on Polaris, its new graphics architecture, to restore its competitive position in the industry. According to CEO Lisa Su, these new graphics cards are on schedule.
We remain on track to introduce our new 14 nanometer FinFET-based Polaris GPUs midyear. Polaris delivers double the performance per watt of our current mainstream offerings, which we believe provides us with significant opportunities to gain share.
Both AMD's Polaris and NVIDIA's upcoming Pascal GPUs will be built on 14/16 nm FinFET processes, following years of both companies being stuck at 28nm. The improvements in performance and efficiency should be substantial, and as long as Polaris can go toe to toe with Pascal in both areas, AMD should be able to claw back at least some market share.
New semi-custom wins set to deliver AMD's semi-custom business, which up until now has been comprised solely of the SoCs that power the major game consoles, will get a jolt during the second half of this year. AMD has previously announced three additional semi-custom design wins, expected to generate a total of roughly $1.5 billion over the course of a few years. According to Su, the first revenues from these efforts will begin rolling in later this year.
Based on our current visibility, we expect semi-custom unit shipments and revenue to grow on an annual basis based on strong demand for game consoles and the ramp of our previously announced new business in the second half of the year.
Game console sales have been strong this generation, but AMD receives less per unit as time goes on, meaning that AMD's revenue from the game consoles can peak before units do. However, the company expects to grow its semi-custom business this year due to new revenue from additional design wins. Details are scarce regarding the nature of these semi-custom chips, but diversifying beyond the game consoles is an important step for AMD.
Zen in the data center AMD expects its upcoming Zen CPUs to restore its competitiveness in the CPU market, where Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is dominant. The first Zen PC CPUs are expected toward the end of this year, but the server version won't be widely available until next year. Su provided an update on Zen's progress:
I am also pleased to share that we are making excellent progress on our strategy to reestablish our presence in the data center market as we successfully passed several key milestones related to our next-generation Zen-based server processor. The Zen silicon running in our bring-up labs is meeting our expectations, and priority customer sampling is on track to begin this quarter in advance of data center system availability in 2017.
Intel has essentially run away with the server chip market, but AMD will make an attempt to regain share next year. Zen promises a 40% boost in instructions per clock compared to AMD's previous CPUs, and with the chips being built on a 14nm process, Intel's manufacturing edge will be smaller than it's been in quite some time. AMD is also employing a separate strategy, forming a joint venture with a Chinese firm and licensing its technology, in an effort to win market share in China. Given how low AMD's server chip market share is at the moment – it basically rounds down to zero-even modest gains would be a boon for the company.
The JV won't boost revenue by much Strategically, AMD's server chip joint venture makes a lot of sense. The company will receive $293 million in licensing fees, in addition to royalty payments from future product sales. But this won't do much to boost revenue this year, according to Su.
So look, on the JV licensing payments, we will expect about half of the licensing revenue to come over the next two years, so over 2016 and 2017. Our current forecast for 2016 was that $50-ish million that Devinder mentioned, and it is contingent on several milestones that we believe are on track.
Only about $50 million of revenue will be recognized this year, with another $100 million coming in 2017 and the remaining half in later years. These payments are based on the JV achieving certain milestones, so they aren't guaranteed. The good news is that much of this should flow through to the bottom line after taxes.
Optimistic guidance 2015 was an awful year for AMD, but according to CFO Devinder Kumar, AMD expects 2016 to be better.
For the full-year 2016, we continue to expect revenue to grow year over year, to be non-GAAP operating profitable in the second half of 2016, and to generate positive free cash flow from operations for 2016.
AMD will return to revenue growth this year, according to its guidance, driven by new semi-custom design wins and the launch of Polaris. AMD also expects to post a non-GAAP operating profit during the second half, although net income will still very likely be negative due to interest payments. The licensing payments will certainly help the cause, and if AMD hits its guidance, it would be proof that the turnaround is finally making some progress after years of turmoil.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) soared more than 50% on April 22 after the chipmaker's first quarter earnings beat expectations. The stock has since given up some of those gains, but investors might be wondering if it's finally time to buy some shares of the beaten-down chipmaker. Let's take a look at its key numbers, guidance, and new announcements to decide.

Image source: AMD.
The key numbersAMD's revenue fell 19% annually to $832 million, which beat expectations by $13.8 million. Computing and Graphics revenue, which accounted for 55% of that total, fell 14% due to lower sales of PC processors and lower average selling prices for both CPUs and GPUs. However, the unit's operating loss narrowed slightly from $75 million a year ago to $70 million. EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) revenue, which accounted for the remaining 45% of its sales, fell 25% due to lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. The unit's operating income plunged 64% to $16 million due to higher R&D expenses.
On the bottom line, AMD posted a non-GAAP net loss of $96 million, or $0.12 per share, which was wider than its loss of $0.09 a year earlier but a penny higher than expectations. On a GAAP basis, AMD's net loss narrowed from $180 million in the prior year quarter to $109 million.
Positive developmentsAMD expects its revenue to rise 15% sequentially during the current quarter, which exceeds expectations for 7% growth. That would also equal 2% year-over-year growth -- which would represent its first quarter of annual sales growth since the second quarter of 2014.
CEO Lisa Su attributes that rebound to ""new product introductions and design wins,"" which might include new consoles like Sony's 4K-capable ""PlayStation NEO"" and Nintendo's next-gen ""NX"" console. Those design wins are expected to boost its EESC revenue with higher orders of semi-custom SoCs. Su also believes that launching new 14nm FinNET-based Polaris GPUs in mid-2016 will provide AMD ""with significant opportunities to gain share"" against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Su claims that Polaris will deliver ""double the performance per watt"" of its current GPUs.
AMD also disclosed a new joint venture with Chinese firm THATIC to ""develop SoCs tailored to the Chinese server market that will complement AMD's own offerings."" This deal includes a $293 million licensing agreement, in which payments will depend on the SoCs ""achieving certain milestones,"" as well as royalty payments on SoC sales. That partnership is a vote of confidence for AMD's ARM-licensed server CPU, which it introduced in January, and could also boost its EESC revenue.
But competition remains fierceAMD's forecast looks rosy, but investors should remember that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia still respectively dominate the CPU and high-end GPU markets.
AMD's best shot at catching up to Intel is Zen, its next-gen CPU, which will arrive at the end of the year. AMD claims that Zen chips will offer a 40% improvement in IPC (instructions per cycle) over its maligned Bulldozer chips. However, it's still unclear how the 14nm Zen chips will fare against Intel's comparable 14nm Skylake chips. Intel will also update Skylake with the Kaby Lake revision in the second half of 2016, followed by 10nm Cannonlake chips in 2017. Those two updates could render Zen obsolete by the time it arrives. Intel also still controls about 99% of the worldwide data center market with its Xeon chips, so the impact of ARM-based AMD server CPUs could be minimal.
In the add-in graphics board market, Nvidia will launch new Pascal GPUs this summer to counter AMD's Polaris. Nvidia has also been integrating its GPUs with its mobile Tegra CPUs in its Drive PX2 platform for autonomous cars -- which gives it additional growth opportunities beyond professional graphics and gaming. We won't know how Polaris fares against Pascal until both GPUs arrive, but AMD must make a huge splash to gain market share against Nvidia, which controlled over 80% of the add-in graphics board market at the end of 2015.
Look but don't touchEven after its recent rally, AMD's EV/Sales ratio of 1.2 is much lower than Intel's ratio of 2.7 and Nvidia's ratio of 3.2. While that makes AMD look ""cheaper"", it also faces a less certain future than both rivals. AMD has carved out a nice niche market in consoles, but demand remains seasonal, and its dependence on console makers likely gives it less clout in price negotiations. Higher R&D expenses could also prevent AMD from becoming profitable again, even as revenue growth improves.
Therefore, I'm adding AMD to my watchlist for now, but I'm not planning to pick up shares anytime soon. The company's first quarter report was good and its guidance was solid, but I don't think a 50% rally was justified or sustainable.

Investors who have held on to shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were rewarded last week when the stock surged nearly 50% following the company's first-quarter earnings report. Some of those gains have since been given back, but the stock now sits at the highest level since late 2014.
AMD's results, while still lackluster on an absolute basis, bested analyst expectations, and the company's guidance was better than expected as well. The big news, though, was a licensing deal that will put nearly $300 million of cash into the company's coffers. Here's what investors need to know about AMD's first-quarter results.
The numbers AMD reported revenue of $832 million for the first quarter, down 19.2% year over year, but about $14 million higher than analysts were expecting. AMD pointed to lower sales of semi-custom SoCs and client notebook processors as the main drivers of the revenue decline.
Sales from the computing and graphics segment slumped 14% year over year to $460 million. Demand for PCs remains sluggish, with IDC reporting that PC shipments declined by 11.5% year over year during the first quarter. Despite lower revenue, the segment operating loss was $70 million, down from $75 million during the prior-year period.
The enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment suffered a steeper decline, with revenue falling by 25% year over year to $372 million. The major game consoles remain the biggest source of revenue in this segment, although the second half of the year will bring additional revenue through the three additional semi-custom design wins AMD has previously announced. Operating profit for the segment declined to just $16 million, down from $45 million during the prior-year period.
AMD reported a non-GAAP loss of $0.12 per share, worse than the $0.09-per-share loss reported during the prior-year period, but $0.01 better than analysts were expecting. On a GAAP basis, AMD reported a loss of $0.14 per share.
The guidance While AMD's first-quarter results offered little indication of progress, the company's guidance calls for improvement during the second quarter and the second half of the year. AMD expects revenue to increase by 15% sequentially during the second quarter, while analysts were expecting a more modest 7% rise. This guidance represents a slight year-over-year increase, the first in quite some time. Strong demand for both semi-custom chips and graphics products will drive this revenue increase, according to the company.
For the full year, AMD expects revenue to grow compared to 2015, with the company returning to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second half of the year. Investors should note that AMD is on the hook for about $160 million in interest payments each year, meaning that the company's net income will remain negative in 2016. Operating cash flow is also expected to turn positive in 2016, although free cash flow will almost certainly remain negative as well. During 2015, AMD posted a free cash flow loss of $322 million.
The licensing deal Beyond AMD's optimistic guidance, the big news was a licensing deal the company struck with Chinese firm THATIC. AMD will license its high-performance processor and SoC technology to a newly created joint venture with the company in an effort to develop SoCs aimed at the Chinese server market. AMD will receive $293 million in cash, with payments contingent on the JV achieving certain milestones, and the company will receive royalty income from the JV's future product sales as well.
Besides providing AMD with much-needed cash, the licensing deal targets the Chinese server market in a way that could lead to meaningful market share gains for the company. China has been aiming to become less dependent on U.S. technology products, and licensing its IP may be the simplest way to win back market share from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in China.
This is similar to what International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is attempting through the OpenPOWER foundation. IBM is allowing third-party companies to design custom POWER chips, and Chinese firm Suzhou PowerCore began doing exactly that last year. Intel's dominance of the server chip market in China will face considerable challenges with both IBM and AMD licensing their respective technologies.
Foolish thoughts AMD's first quarter showed no real signs of improvement, but the company expects the second half of the year to look a lot better. If AMD hits its guidance, 2016 will finally bring to a halt the revenue declines that have plagued the company for the past few years.
Revenue from additional semi-custom deals, and payments from the licensing deal, will boost AMD's sales during the second half of the year. But the success of Polaris, AMD's upcoming line of graphics cards, will likely determine whether AMD hits its targets. If AMD fails to win back considerable market share from NVIDIA, non-GAAP operating profitability may need to be pushed back into 2017.
AMD has made big promises before. During the company's analyst day presentation in May of 2015, AMD offered similar optimistic guidance for the second half of last year. That guidance was soon abandoned as the PC market continued to slump. With the stock surging nearly 50% after AMD's earnings report, investors are betting that this time will be different.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) slumped on Monday, giving back some of the post-earnings gains the stock racked up on Friday. At 11 a.m. ET Monday, shares of AMD were down about 12.5%.
So what: AMD reported its first-quarter results last Thursday following the market close. The company beat analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings, provided guidance that was above analyst expectations, and announced a licensing deal that will bring in $293 million of much-needed cash. This raft of good news, along with a likely short squeeze, sent shares of AMD soaring, with the stock gaining nearly 50% on Friday.
While the news was genuinely positive for AMD, the market's reaction may have been a bit overdone. The company is still unprofitable, and while it expects to return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second half of this year, about $160 million in annual interest payments means the company will still post a major net loss.
The drop in AMD stock on Monday was likely a hangover from the massive gains on Friday. While AMD received a variety of analyst upgrades following earnings, Wedbush remained cautious on the stock, suggesting the stock's gains may not last given the challenges facing the company.
Now what: There are a few things working in AMD's favor this year that will help the company's results. First, AMD previously announced it had secured three semi-custom design wins beyond the current game consoles, and that these wins would generated about $1.5 billion of revenue over the course of three years. This revenue will began ramping up during the second half of this year, providing a boost to the company's semi-custom segment.
Second, AMD's new Polaris graphics cards are expected to launch toward the middle of this year. If successful, AMD could win back some graphics card market share from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) during the second half. At the moment, NVIDIA controls about 80% of the market, up from around 60% in early 2014. NVIDIA will also be launching new graphics cards this year, which means AMD winning back significant market share is far from a foregone conclusion.
Shares of AMD may be volatile for a while as investors digest all of this news, but it's clear from Monday's drop that the huge gains on Friday may have been an overreaction.

Investors will look at Friday's close for the stock market and think stocks finished the week on a quiet note, but nothing could be further from the truth. A big slate of major technology company earnings releases set the tone for the market, and it took a sizable afternoon rally for major market benchmarks to claw their way back toward the unchanged mark. The Dow even managed to climb above 18,000 again, overcoming poor tech-stock performance that held the Nasdaq down by nearly a full percentage point.
Many stocks managed to climb, though, and among the best performers were Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN), and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC).
Advanced Micro Devices soared 52% after reporting much better results in its first-quarter financial report Thursday afternoon than investors had expected to see. Sales were still down 19% from year-ago levels, but AMD managed to limit its adjusted loss to $0.12 per share, and that gave investors hope that the company might finally have found a solid strategy going forward. Guidance for the current quarter should include a revenue bounce, and many investors took company comments as hints that new game consoles might legitimize AMD's move to focus on the video-gaming industry. Most importantly, AMD said it had licensed certain system-on-chip technology to a joint venture with a Chinese tech company for nearly $300 million. If AMD can successfully monetize some of its intellectual property, then it could dramatically increase the value of its overall assets, and today's share-price move reflects a revaluation by investors of the company's prospects in the long run.
Southwestern Energy jumped 15% in the wake of its own favorable first-quarter earnings news. The energy specialist posted an adjusted loss of $0.08 per share, but that was less than half the loss most investors were looking to see from the company. Further asset writedowns were necessary as a result of poor market conditions for oil and gas, but many investors were pleased that Southwestern managed to keep production levels rising despite spending less money on capital expenditures. The company celebrated the fact that it generated more net cash than it invested in operations during the first quarter, and Southwestern Energy believes it will be able to identify even more ways to become more efficient and focus its efforts on its most lucrative plays. The industry still has a long way to go, but Southwestern seems to be navigating tough conditions well.
Finally, Norfolk Southern gained 11%. The railroad giant surprised investors by posting a much better profit than expected, with net income of $387 million working out to $1.29 per share, topping the consensus forecast by $0.32. Industry conditions remained challenging, but Norfolk Southern responded with efforts to streamline operations, cut costs, and maintain customer service. The railroad's operating ratio fell eight percentage points to just over 70%, and strong gains in revenue from automotive shipments helped cushion the blow of weaker volume for coal and intermodal transport. Several analysts added positive comments about Norfolk Southern's efforts, noting that even though major areas like coal remain difficult, the railroad is working hard to restructure itself to become less reliant on deteriorating industries and diversify its exposure.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped more than 38% Friday after the company announced a notable IP licensing agreement along with better-than-expected first-quarter 2016 results.
So what: Quarterly revenue fell 19.2% year over year, to $832 million, and, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), translated to a net loss of $109 million, or $0.14 per share. On an adjusted basis, AMD's net loss was a more modest $96 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to a loss of $73 million, or $0.09 per share in last year's first quarter.
That might not sound impressive, but analysts, on average, were anticipating a wider net loss of $0.13 per share on even lower revenue of $818.2 million.
In any case, AMD blamed its revenue declines primarily on lower sales of semi-custom SoCs and client notebook processors. But gross margin also ticked up two percentage points, to 32%, helped by ""a richer product mix and the mix of revenue between business segments.""
Now what: But arguably most exciting is the fact AMD has struck a $293 million agreement to license its processor and SoC technology to a newly created joint venture it formed with China-based Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., Ltd. -- THATIC, for short -- to develop SoCs tailored to the Chiense Server market to complement AMD's offerings. 
The company calls the agreement ""a meaningful step in AMD's IP monetization strategy intended to accelerate the Company's growth and better monetize its valuable assets.""
Payments are contingent upon the joint venture achieving certain undisclosed milestones, while AMD anticipates receiving additional royalty payments from the joint venture's future product sales.
Finally, AMD anticipates revenue for the current quarter to increase 15% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. That equates to a range of $931.8 million to $981.8 million, which is also well above analysts' expectations for second-quarter 2016 revenue of $889.2 million. During the subsequent conference call, AMD management credited three semi-custom SoC design wins as a ""large driver"" of this upside surprise -- potentially hinting its semi-custom chips have found a home in all three major gaming console providers' widely anticipated next-gen systems.
In the end, AMD's beat and raise would have been good enough to send the stock flying today. But by combining that beat with the significant IP licensing agreement and the hope it will set the stage for similar deals with other licensees going forward, AMD is understandably riding a wave of optimism regarding its ability to once again achieve sustained profitability. While I'm personally content watching from the sidelines until the dust settles given the gravity of Friday's pop, it's no surprise to see shares of AMD up big.

Investors are all a-twitter about the bad news at Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) this week. Revenue was weak, profits growth was in the low single digits, guidance for the full year was lousy -- and 12,000 workers are about to be laid off. But over at Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), the joint is jumping.
The news Analysts looking ahead to AMD's earnings report this week were predicting a big decline in revenue and a big quarterly loss of $0.13 per share. When the news actually came out, however, it was less-bad than feared. Sales and profits both went down, granted, but less than analysts had predicted. Better still, management predicted a sequential rise in revenue in Q2.
This has at least two separate analysts -- MKM Partners and Craig-Hallum -- talking about a ""resurrection"" of AMD's business. As related by TheFly.com this morning, both firms were sufficiently impressed with the progress AMD is making that they've decided to upgrade the shares to buy in anticipation of a turnaround.
Here are three things you need to know about that upgrade.
 AMD wants to be big in servers. But will it ever produce big profits? Image source: AMD.
Thing No. 1: Revenue will rise AMD management promised investors 12% to 18% sequential improvement in revenue in Q2. At the midpoint, that estimate implies revenue will grow past $956 million -- growth twice as fast as the 7% growth rate Wall Street had been predicting.
More important than the sequential number, by the way, is that AMD is predicting it will collect more revenuesin Q2 2016 than it did in Q2 2015. This is real, honest-to-goodness year-over-year sales growth that AMD is promising.
Thing No. 2: Real growth from virtual reality AMD sees the new wave of virtual reality gaming as key to its success. Desktop graphics chips revenue was already up by double-digits (percentage-wise and sequentially) in Q1. Now AMD has is promising that the ""proliferation of virtual reality"" will drive strong demand for its chips over the longer term.
Craig-Hallum is swallowing that argument whole, and calling VR ""a significant positive for the chip maker.""
Thing No. 3: Building a great wall in China? One other thing that's exciting these analysts is AMD's decision to partner with THATIC to produce computer chips in China. MKM believes this will help AMD to grab a piece of China's ""$12B-$14B server chip market,"" and pose ""a serious challenge"" to Intel in the Chinese market.
Craig-Hallum, too, is predicting ""significant success"" for AMD in China, and predicting a ""major turnaround"" for AMD as a whole.
The really important thing: Valuation Add it all up, and MKM thinks that AMD shares, previously priced under $3 and worth no more than $2.90 in its estimation, could now rise as high as $4 a share. Investors are jumping on board that estimate, driving AMD shares nearly $1 higher in Friday trading, and paying as much as $3.61 per share for the chip stock. But with so much of the predicting share price growth already having happened this morning, is there any more room to run?
Craig-Hallum thinks so. Even more bullish than MKM, Craig-Hallum used to think that AMD shares were worth about $3 apiece. Now, Craig-Hallum thinks AMD shares could hit $6 within a year!
That being said, cautious investors might want to take a step back from the hype, and focus on the facts. Yes, AMD is promising sales growth, and yes, analysts are predicting a turnaround -- but we've heard all this before. For example, way back in 2009, when Intel settled a big lawsuit brought by AMD, and forked over $1.25 billion to its rival.
And yet, since that date, what has really happened? AMD's revenue has continued to shrink, and the company has resumed its old habits of losing money hand over fist. In fact, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, AMD managed to lose $1.8 billion over the past five years combined, and hasn't earned one red cent of profit in the past four years.
Long story short, while it's always possible that ""this time will be different,"" keep this in mind: Despite beating estimates, AMD still lost money last quarter. It's lost nearly $600 million over the past year. And according to the estimates of most analysts, AMD is going to continue losing money for the foreseeable future. (On S&P Global, not a single analyst is positing a profitable year for AMD any time before 2019.)
Long story shorter: Caveat investor. AMD is still no buy.

With new product launches still at least a few months away, signs of a turnaround are unlikely to show up in Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) first-quarter earnings report. Results will be announced Thursday following the market close, and if analyst estimates are correct, investors can expect a steep decline in revenue and earnings.
Demand for PCs remained weak during the first quarter, with IDC reporting that global unit shipments declined by 11.5% year over year. AMD's core business is heavily dependent on the PC, and without any indication that demand is stabilizing, returning to revenue growth will be difficult for the company. AMD plans to launch new GPUs and CPUs later this year, and both are expected to improve the company's competitive position, but a weak PC market will make executing a turnaround far more difficult.
What analysts are expecting The average analyst estimate calls for AMD's first-quarter revenue to decline by 20.6% year over year to $818.2 million. This estimate is in line with AMD's guidance for a sequential revenue decline of 14%, plus or minus 3%. The computing and graphics segment, which contains both CPUs and GPUs aimed at PCs, has been the biggest driver of AMD's recent revenue declines. But the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment, which contains AMD's game console chip business, suffered a revenue decline as well during the fourth quarter, suggesting that AMD's game console revenue this cycle may have already peaked.
A non-GAAP loss of $0.13 per share is expected by analysts, down from a loss of $0.09 per share during the prior-year period. The semi-custom segment has been a source of profits for the company in recent years, but losses in the computing and graphics segment have overwhelmed those gains. AMD's debt load is also a factor, with quarterly interest payments of about $40 million knocking down profitability.
Analysts are expecting things to improve going forward, with just a 3.5% revenue decline expected for the full year and a 5.4% revenue increase in 2017. Analysts are also predicting losses to shrink in 2016 compared to 2015. Hitting these numbers will require AMD's upcoming Polaris GPUs and Zen CPUs to drive meaningful market share gains, an outcome that is far from guaranteed.
Looking ahead AMD's first quarter will likely be more of the same. The PC market hasn't improved, and without any new products, it's unlikely that AMD has managed to win back much market share. In the GPU market, rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) shipped just shy of 80% of discrete graphics cards during the fourth quarter, and while AMD has been slowly clawing back share, the gap between the two companies is far larger than it was just a few years ago.
AMD's 2015 graphics card launch, which included new high-end cards like the Fury X and a rebranding of the rest of the lineup, did little to improve AMD's position in the industry. Polaris, which will bring significant improvements in both performance and efficiency, in part due to the move to a 14nm manufacturing process, will be up against NVIDIA's Pascal architecture, which promises similar gains. An exact launch date for Polaris hasn't been announced, although rumors point to June. Expect management to discuss the upcoming launch during AMD's earnings conference call.
On the CPU front, AMD's Zen microarchitecture is planned to debut toward the end of this year. AMD has lost considerable market share to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) over the past few years, and a weak PC market is now ravaging both companies' results. During the fourth quarter, Intel reported that desktop and notebook unit volumes dropped by 9% and 10%, respectively, contributing to a decline in net income.
Market share gains prior to Zen will be tough for AMD, which means that the next few quarters are unlikely to show much improvement. If Zen delivers, Intel could face serious competition in both the PC and server CPU markets. But if Zen falls short of expectations, a return to profitability becomes more difficult to imagine.
AMD's first-quarter numbers are going to be ugly, continuing a trend that has persisted for the past couple of years. The turnaround will begin in earnest with the launch of Polaris in a few months and pick up steam with Zen. That's the hope, at least. For now, AMD investors will need to continue to stomach the company's terrible results.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been suffering from falling revenue and profits for the past few years, and it doesn't look like that will change when AMD reports its first-quarter results next week. Global PC sales slumped 11.5% during the first quarter, according to IDC, and with AMD heavily dependent on the PC market, another steep revenue decline is in the cards. AMD stock has surged recently, but the company desperately needs to win back some market share.
Streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is also reporting results next week, and the company expects to continue adding international subscribers at a rapid pace. Back in 2014, Netflix boosted its prices but promised that old members would be free from price hikes for two years. That two-year window ends next month, and while Netflix's first-quarter results won't be affected, at least some members may drop the service going forward.
Following a holiday quarter that propelled the stock higher, Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) is facing major headwinds in 2016 that will be reflected in its first-quarter report. A significant source of revenue is gone, and currency continues to wreak havoc on Mattel's results. Mattel's core brands, which include Barbie, Fisher-Price, and Hot Wheels, returned to growth in the fourth quarter, but revenue growth will be tough to come by this year. The good news is that Mattel has so far maintained its lofty 4.6% dividend yield, giving investors a reason to stick around.

            ","Technology has, and will continue to, shape the world we live in. Not only has this had major implications for the average individual, but it has had profound effects for investors. One cannot read a history of the modern stock market without getting at least a hint of the unimaginable wealth that has been generated by disruptive, dominant, innovative technology firms. This is not to say that the secret to wealth is exclusively investing in technology, but not to have a stake in the future itself via owning pieces of today's top tech firms is downright, well, (lowercase) foolish.
With this in mind, and in the hopes of finding the next winning tech shares, some of The Motley Fool's best and brightest put their heads together and came up with three tech stocks that they believe could soar in 2016. Read on to learn what they came up with. 
Tim Green: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been hemorrhaging market share in both the GPU and CPU markets over the past couple of years. The company is posting big losses every quarter, and its stock has been decimated over the past five years, losing about two-thirds of its value. Over the past 10 years, the stock has lost a staggering 90% of its value.

AMD data by YCharts.
But 2016 is a big year for AMD, and if things go right, the stock could make a major recovery. After losing considerable share in the GPU market, the company plans to launch a brand-new line of graphics cards, Polaris, later this year. AMD promises significant performance and efficiency gains, and if Polaris meets expectations, AMD's GPU business may finally return to growth.
Towards the end of 2016, AMD plans to launch Zen, its brand-new CPU microarchitecture. The company's current line of CPUs has largely been a disaster, giving Intel an enormous lead in both the PC and server markets. Zen aims to fix these issues, with AMD promising a 40% boost in instructions-per-clock, which should go a long way in closing the performance gap with Intel products. And with Intel delaying its 10nm manufacturing process, the manufacturing gap between Intel and AMD will narrow considerably.
If AMD can execute and launch competitive GPU and CPU products this year, a change in investor sentiment could send the stock soaring. The company has a history of overpromising and underdelivering, though, making the stock risky despite its beaten-down price tag.
Sean O'Reilly: My pick for a technology stock that could soar this year, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has a great deal to offer venturesome investors. After all, it isn't every day one can buy into dominant search engine in a gargantuan, burgeoning Internet market. Often compared to Alphabet's Google search engine (and rightly so), Baidu sports a 70% market share of the Chinese Internet search market. Not quite as good as Google stateside but more than respectable.

All the more impressive is Baidu's financial results. The company generated record free cash flow last year of just under $2.2 billion, grew revenues by 32% and continues to make strides in the early stages of the fast-growing Chinese online-to-offline market (which is basically code for the blurring of the lines between online and traditional shopping experiences). 
Shares have been sold off en masse as fears surrounding China's slowing growth rate have made their way to its capital markets. Granted, GDP growth is slowing to a more manageable 6%-7% (which is still crazy fast on a global basis, no matter how you slice it), but the bottom line for investors is that none of this really matters to Baidu in the long term. As China's dominant search engine, the company stands to benefit mightily as the country becomes more connected.
Shares are well off their highs of late 2014/2015, when Baidu shares traded hands for some $250. Now valued at just 29 times forward S&P Global Market Intelligence EPS estimates, which compares favorably to Alphabet's own forward P/E of 28, Baidu could very well soar this year as the market properly values its authoritative franchise in an industry that will continue to grow in the decades ahead. 
Keith Noonan: Most known as the supplier of the video chips at the core of GoPro cameras, Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) has seen its stock price fall roughly 40% over the last year. This is due to a reduced growth forecast and mounting challenges from resource-rich competitors including Qualcomm. The roughly $1.4 billion market cap semiconductor company does have a history of volatility. Although the stock's recent declines are at least partially reflective of compounding risks and uncertainties facing the company, a depressed valuation, momentum in emerging segments, and a solid balance sheet set up the potential for big gains in the remainder of 2016.
Much of Ambarella's woes in the last year can be tied to the poor performance of GoPro's Hero4 Session camera -- a reduced form factor variation on the camera company's Hero 4 line that was intended to bridge a gap as GoPro readied its next mainline for release. Sales to GoPro have recently made up somewhere in the neighborhood of 30% of Ambarella's revenues, and the lack of a hit product to shift inventory has highlighted concerns that the video chip company is overly reliant on its biggest customer. Softness in wearables is forecast to drive revenues for the current quarter down somewhere between 20% and 24% compared to the prior year quarter. However, even as the company deals with a weak release stretch in the action camera space, it still has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 15 and a forward PEG ratio of approximately 0.56.
Action cameras will continue to play a big role in Ambarella's performance, but the company's security IP camera segment looks strong, and emerging demand for drone, automobile, and smart home cameras and sensors opens up opportunities. With no debt on the books and an enterprise value of roughly $1.1 billion, a stronger-than-expected performance for one of its growing product categories or a strong release from GoPro could send Ambarella stock soaring.

            ","It's no secret Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is struggling. AMD has posted a loss in each of the past four years, with share losses to Intel in the CPU market and to NVIDIA in the GPU market putting the company in a difficult spot. Design wins for the major game consoles have saved the company from ruin, providing a much-needed source of revenue and profits, but AMD's turnaround has shown few signs of progress. The company is planning major new CPU and GPU launches this year, which could finally turn the tide.
NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), in contrast, is coming off a very profitable 2015. The company, which designs chips for a wide variety of areas including automotive and mobile payments, earned $1.5 billion of net income last year on $6.1 billion of revenue. NXP's recently closed acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor deepened its automotive business, positioning the company to benefit from the increasing connectivity and computing power of the automobile.
Which of these two options -- an uncertain turnaround story with significant upside if things go right, or a wildly profitable company betting big on smarter cars -- offers the best opportunity for investors?

The financial situation at AMD does not inspire confidence. The company has been burning through cash, posting a negative free cash flow for the past four years, and it was recently forced to sell off assets, its assembly and test manufacturing facilities, in order to shore up the balance sheet. At the end of 2015, AMD still had $785 million of cash, above its minimum target of $600 million, but the company's book value had plunged into negative territory.
These losses can't continue forever, but there may be light at the end of the tunnel. AMD plans to launch brand-new graphics cards later this year, based on its Polaris architecture, that promise major improvements in performance and efficiency. AMD has fallen badly behind NVIDIA over the past couple of years, with its unit share of the discrete graphics card market falling from 40% to 20%. If the company can put out competitive products, matching or beating NVIDIA's upcoming Pascal graphics cards in terms of performance, some of that market share could return to AMD.
Also coming later this year is Zen, AMD's brand-new CPU architecture. Zen will replace Bulldozer and its various revisions, which have largely been a disaster for the company. AMD's share of the PC and server CPU markets have plummeted, and a weak market for PCs is rubbing salt in the wounds. Zen promises to boost by 40% instructions per clock, a measure of single-threaded performance, which should help close the performance gap with Intel products.
If everything goes right for AMD, and both its new GPUs and CPUs are successful, the stock could soar. But AMD has a history of over-promising and under-delivering, and if these new products don't improve AMD's financial performance, the stock could tumble even further. Buying AMD stock is a risky bet on a turnaround that may never materialize, but the potential rewards could be worth the risk for some investors.
NXP Semiconductors

The acquisition of Freescale has tilted NXP's portfolio of products more heavily toward automotive. According to the company's guidance for the first quarter, automotive revenue will account for about 36% of total revenue, up from around 20% prior to the merger. According to NXP, the company is now the No. 1 provider of automotive semiconductors in the world. Beyond automotive, NXP offers a variety of products, ranging from NFC chips that enable mobile payment systems to AC-DC power conversion chips for notebook computers.
Even with a larger automotive segment, NXP remains a highly diversified semiconductor company. That doesn't protect it from cyclical downturns in the industry, though, and the company is currently going through a rough patch. Based on NXP's first-quarter guidance, total revenue is set to decline by about 18% compared to the combined revenue of NXP and Freescale in the prior-year period.
NXP stock appears cheap based on last-year's record earnings. The company managed a GAAP operating margin of 33%, generating EPS of $6.10. That puts the current stock price at about 13.6 times earnings. But there's a danger in valuing a cyclical company like NXP based on peak earnings, and if the company's margins don't prove to be sustainable, the stock may ultimately not be as cheap as it seems. Analysts expect non-GAAP earnings to be essentially flat this year, although that may be too optimistic, depending on how long NXP's revenue slump lasts.
In the long run, NXP is well positioned to benefit from the increased penetration of advanced driver assistance systems in automobiles, and eventually, from self-driving cars. In the short run, though, the company's results may be volatile.
NXP is a market leader in many of the areas where it competes, while AMD is playing catch-up in its core markets. For an investment in AMD to work out, everything needs to go right for the company over the coming year. For NXP, the company just needs to avoid major mistakes. From a long-term growth perspective, NXP also seems to offer greater potential, while AMD is still heavily dependent on a slumping PC market. In the end, NXP looks like the clear-cut winner.

One of the hardest things all investors have to deal with is deciding when to sell. Sell too early, and you risk missing out on further gains. Sell too late, and you risk a decline that sends the stock tumbling. Deciding when to buy is much easier. Is the stock cheap, relative to earnings and growth prospects? If so, buy it. Otherwise, don't.
I first bought shares of graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in early 2013, adding to my position twice over the following months. The stock has surged over the past three years, nearly tripling from my lowest purchase price of $12.60 per share. The decision to buy was easy: NVIDIA was shockingly cheap and had a few major growth prospects that were being ignored by the market. Adjusting for the excess cash on the company's balance sheet, NVIDIA traded for a single-digit earnings multiple at the time, a price that seemed too good to be true. Meanwhile, the company's push into the enterprise and mobile markets created the potential for long-term growth.

NVDA data by YCharts.
I've sold pieces of my NVIDIA position a few different times over the past three years for various reasons, but recently, I've fully exited my position. My opinion of the company's growth prospects remains unchanged, but the valuation has risen to levels that don't make much sense.
A nosebleed valuation At the moment, NVIDIA trades for about $36 per share, the highest level since late 2007. In fiscal 2016, the company generated record revenue of $5.01 billion, with growth being driven by strong sales of high-end gaming graphics cards, enterprise products, and automotive platforms. NVIDIA abandoned the mobile device market after attempting to become a major competitor with its Tegra SoCs, and now the focus of the Tegra segment is mostly automotive.
NVIDIA earned $1.08 per share on a GAAP basis in fiscal 2016, putting the P/E ratio at a lofty 33.3. The multiple is lower on a non-GAAP basis, but with much of the difference due to stock-based compensation, I'll stick with the GAAP figures. NVIDIA still has a large net cash position, and adjusting for this, the P/E ratio falls to about 27.8.
This valuation assumes that fairly rapid growth is going to occur going forward, and while there are certainly growth opportunities, there are some headwinds as well. First, NVIDIA recognizes $264 million of revenue each year from a cross-licensing agreement with Intel. That agreement expires next year, and the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which ends in April of 2017, will be the last quarter NVIDIA recognizes that revenue. It's unclear whether the agreement will be renewed, or if the amount of money changing hands will be adjusted. Under the worst-case scenario, all of this revenue goes away; excluding this revenue from fiscal 2016 results, GAAP EPS would have been about 35% lower, assuming everything else remains unchanged.
The second headwind is the very gaming GPU market that has driven NVIDIA's growth over the past few years. NVIDIA's unit share of the discrete graphics card market is roughly 80%, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) claiming the rest. This is up from about 60% a couple of years ago, and it's unlikely that further market share gains are possible. With both NVIDIA and AMD set to launch new graphics cards this year, the best case scenario for NVIDIA is simply maintaining its current lead.
Growth comes at a priceThat's not to say NVIDIA's gaming GPU business can't growth. A shift to higher-end cards has been helping NVIDIA's results, and its GTX 970, which sells for around $350, is the most popular graphics card on the Steam gaming platform. The introduction of virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift can also drive sales of high-end graphics cards, as well as the increasing affordability of 4K screens. I expect NVIDIA's gaming business to continue to post solid results, but I don't think the growth will be enough to justify the valuation.
NVIDIA's other growth areas, namely datacenter and automotive, have long growth runways, but again, I think the valuation more than prices this growth in. During fiscal 2016, the datacenter segment generated $339 million of revenue, just 6.8% of the total, while the automotive segment generated $320 million, 6.4% of the total. These are still small parts of the overall business, and while growth will likely be brisk going forward, paying nearly 30 times earnings is tough to justify.
It was a hard decision to sell NVIDIA, and part of me wanted to hold on for the ride. But it seems to me that the best-case scenario, or close to it, needs to play out for the stock to outperform the market from its current price. As a value investor, I don't like betting on best-case scenarios, and without any margin of safety, it was time for me to end my stint as an NVIDIA shareholder.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soared 33.2% in March, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Various pieces of good news, including the company's announcement that its chips power the vast majority of the total addressable market for VR systems, drove the stock to bounce from deep lows carved out earlier in the year.

AMD data by YCharts.
So what: On March 14, AMD touted its success in the VR market, pointing to data from Jon Peddie Research stating that its chips power 83% of dedicated VR systems. This number includes game consoles, and with AMD powering both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, its high market share shouldn't come as a surprise. Sony plans to launch its PlayStation VR headset in October.
On March 16, a rumor that Intel was interested in licensing AMD's graphics patents sent shares higher. Intel currently pays AMD rival NVIDIA annual payments as part of a cross-licensing deal, but with that deal set to expire next year, there may be an opening for AMD. This rumor was never confirmed, but shares of AMD jumped regardless.
On March 18, reports surfaced that Sony planned to launch an upgraded version of its PlayStation 4 gaming console capable of handling 4K gaming. The new console would require an improved GPU, supplied by AMD, raising the possibility that AMD's semi-custom segment could get an unexpected boost in revenue.
Now what: With shares of AMD tumbling in January, it only took a few pieces of good news to send shares soaring in March. 2016 is an important year for AMD, with the launch of its new Polaris GPUs and its new Zen CPUs set for later this year. AMD will need to win back share in both the GPU and the CPU markets in order to turn around its business. During 2015, the company posted a massive $660 million net loss. It will ultimately take more than a few rumors to drive AMD's stock price higher in the long run.

            ","Shares of graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) have been on a tear over the past three years, rising about 170%. In that time, the company has consolidated its lead in the gaming GPU market at the expense of rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), while simultaneously pushing deeper into the enterprise and automotive markets. For a better idea of where the company stands today, here are three charts that NVIDIA investors need to see.
A dominant GPU market share NVIDIA has long been the No. 1 player in the discrete graphics card market, but its lead over AMD began to grow dramatically in mid-2014. The typical 60-40 split between the two companies in terms of unit market share broke down, and by the second quarter of 2015, NVIDIA's share had surpassed 80%.
 
Data from Jon Peddie Research.
The market for discrete graphics cards is actually in decline in terms of units, down substantially over the past five years, according to Jon Peddie Research. But the market for high-end discrete graphics cards is growing, and that's what has been driving NVIDIA's results. During NVIDIA's most recently reported quarter, gaming revenue jumped 25%, driven by the company's Maxwell-based graphics cards. The company launched the GTX 970 and GTX 980 back in September of 2014 at disruptive prices, helping to drive its market share higher. The GTX 970, a $300-$350 part, has become the most popular graphics card in use on the Steam gaming platform, despite its high price tag.
AMD has regained a bit of market share over the past two quarters, and both NVIDIA and AMD plan to launch brand new GPUs this year, creating a potential opening for AMD to make a comeback. But with NVIDIA's graphics cards stickier than ever thanks to the company's efforts to build an ecosystem around its products, winning back considerable market share will be easier said than done for AMD.
Winning the accelerator market In addition to the gaming market, NVIDIA's GPUs are widely used for high-performance computing and supercomputing applications. NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs are used as accelerators, providing vastly superior performance compared to CPUs for use cases well suited for the massively parallel architecture of a GPU. As of February of 2015, NVIDIA controlled 84% of the accelerator market.

Image source: NVIDIA.
According to NVIDIA, the accelerator business represents a $5 billion growth opportunity. During 2015, NVIDIA's datacenter business, which includes Tesla as well as GRID, the company's graphics virtualization platform, generated about $340 million in revenue, leaving a long runway for future growth.
NVIDIA certainly isn't without competition, though, and one of the biggest threats is CPU giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel has offered accelerator cards of its own for the past few years, but the company's upcoming Knight's Landing could be a major threat to NVIDIA. The good news for NVIDIA is that Pascal, the company's upcoming graphics architecture based on a 16nm FinFET manufacturing process, is set to launch later this year. With Knight's Landing slowly rolling out this year, Intel's manufacturing edge will likely be minimized.
The datacenter business is one of NVIDIA's most important growth opportunities, and while its market share may shrink as competition heats up, Tesla has been a major success for the company.
Becoming a platform business NVIDIA likes to call itself a platform company, and for good reason. In the gaming market, NVIDIA has built an ecosystem around its GeForce gaming GPUs, pushing software like GeForce Experience and launching its own SHIELD devices that provide additional functionality to owners of GeForce graphics cards. In the automotive market, the Drive PX and Drive CX platforms provide automotive companies with solutions, not just chips.
There's no better evidence to show that this strategy is working than the evolution of NVIDIA's gross margin.

NVDA Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts
NVIDIA has become far less dependent on the OEM market over the past few years, helping to drive its gross margin higher. In fiscal 2013, sales derived from PC and Tegra OEMs accounted for 42% of total revenue. By the second quarter of fiscal 2016, that percentage had dropped to just 9%. OEM sales carry the lowest gross margin of any of NVIDIA's segments, well below the company average.
Going forward, NVIDIA is well positioned in all of its major businesses for continued growth, although competition, from AMD in gaming, Intel in data center, and a variety of competitors in automotive, will certainly pose a challenge.

            ","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently announced in its 10-K filing that it will move away from its ""tick-tock"" chip production cycle and toward a three-step development process instead. For decades, Intel's chipmaking business has relied on alternating ""ticks"" and ""tocks"" every year. 
During a ""tick"" launch, Intel introduces a smaller microarchitecture with a new manufacturing process. During a ""tock"" launch, the microprocessors are upgraded, but the size remains the same. From now on, Intel will replace that 24-month cycle with a 30-month ""process, architecture, optimization"" model instead.

Inside an Intel manufacturing plant. Source: Intel.
The original tick-tock strategy formed the foundation of Moore's Law, a concept named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, which claims that the number of transistors within the same area of silicon will double every two years. Following that ""law"" kept Intel at the top of the PC and server chip markets, while serving as a plot device for countless sci-fi stories about malevolent AIs.
But in recent years, it's become much harder to shrink down chips and squeeze in more transistors. During a conference call last year, CEO Brian Krzanich admitted that the tick-tock period had expanded closer to two and a half years rather than two. Therefore, Intel's official expansion of the tick-tock cycle into three steps wasn't that surprising. But will doing so dull Intel's competitive edge against rival chipmakers?
Understanding the new 30-month cycleIntel's ""process, architecture, and optimization"" model basically adds an additional ""optimization"" stage to the end of the tick-tock cycle. Simply put, it lets Intel stay on each ""tick"" -- as defined by the size of the die, in nanometers -- for longer than before.
Intel's newest generation chips are 14nm ones. Intel ushered in that generation with the Broadwell design in September 2014, which it upgraded in August 2015 with Skylake. Intel will then ""optimize"" the 14nm design with Kaby Lake near the end of 2016. Intel originally intended for Skylake to be directly succeeded by the 10nm Cannonlake chips this year, but the company has since delayed that ""tick"" upgrade to the second half of 2017.
Intel insists that this expanded launch cycle doesn't mean that Moore's Law has ended. Critics, however, have long claimed that Moore's Law is merely a business and marketing strategy instead of an actual scientific ""law"". For example, the original Moore's Law from 1965 called for the number of transistors to double every year, before it was stretched to a ""two-year cadence"" in 1975. The official expansion of that ""law"" to 30 months indicates that the 1975 version of Moore's Law needs to be revised again.

A single wafer consists of multiple squares, or ""dies."" Source: Intel.
What does this mean for Intel's business?The good news for Intel investors is that the chipmaker still creates industry standard, ""best in breed"" chips for PCs and servers. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), its only meaningful competitor in the x86 arena, shot itself in the foot when its current generation of Bulldozer CPUs fell behind Intel's in terms of single-threaded performance.
AMD's best hope for striking back is launching its new generation of Zen chips by the end of this year. However, the Zen will be AMD's first 14nm CPU, and it will arrive more than two years after Intel's Broadwell. The Zen might compete effectively against Intel's Kaby Lake processors, but it's highly doubtful that it will launch 10nm processors before Intel.
Last summer, IBM (NYSE:IBM) apparently leapfrogged over Intel with the creation of a 7nm chip. However, that process used a silicon-germanium manufacturing process instead of the pure silicon process which Intel uses. Therefore, the chip was an interesting showcase piece that generated a lot of buzz, but it's still far too expensive to be fully commercialized. Moreover, IBM's server chip designs use the Power architecture, which has been marginalized by Intel's 99% share of the data center market.
Intel investors have other things to worry aboutThe ""end"" of the tick-tock cycle and Moore's Law might reduce the speed at which Intel shrinks its die, but it's hard to see AMD catching up and denting its share of the PC and data center markets anytime soon. Instead, investors should focus on the near-term threats facing the company -- sluggish PC sales and its failure to enter the mobile chip market. Both factors will likely weigh down its Client Computing business, which posted an 8% sales decline last year.
Introducing new chip architectures every two to three years is still a solid long-term plan for Intel, but it's unclear if those new chips will convince stubborn PC users to consistently upgrade their aging, ""good enough"" machines.

The stock market took a break Monday, trading in a relatively narrow range and consolidating the gains that it has posted in the past several weeks. Minor concerns sent the major market benchmarks down modestly during the early part of the day, but investors slowly but surely bid up stocks enough to allow the Dow to finish up from Friday's close. The S&P 500 limited its losses to just over a tenth of a percentage point. Yet even with the lack of excitement from the overall market, several stocks posted sharp gains, including Starwood Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:HOT), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH).
Starwood Hotels & Resorts finished the day up 8% after the hotel operator saw a new player come into the mix in its bid to sell itself. China's Anbang Insurance Group made a $12.8 billion non-binding cash offer for Starwood, one-upping the merger bid that Starwood had already received from rival hotelier Marriott. Marriott's bid amounted to $12.2 billion when first made back in November, and it involved a combination of cash and Marriott stock. Market fluctuations have widened the distance between Anbang's $78 per share cash offer and the Marriott bid, but the non-binding nature of the Anbang bid could make Starwood investors reluctant to turn down Marriott's terms. At this point, some investors hope that Marriott will boost its previous bid, but the stock trades well below what Anbang said it might pay.
Advanced Micro Devices climbed 8% as investors got excited about the chipmaker's advances in the global virtual reality systems market. In a press release this morning, AMD revealed new advances in hardware and software to make virtual reality more prevalent in the technology world, and it unveiled a new certification program for graphics processing units to simplify the adoption of virtual reality technology among consumers and developers. Advanced Micro says that it has about an 83% market share in home entertainment virtual reality systems globally, and virtual reality-capable gaming consoles powered by AMD technology are in millions of homes across the world. With key partnerships with makers of popular virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift, AMD's Radeon ecosystem is establishing itself as a first-mover in the virtual reality space.
Finally, GW Pharmaceuticals more than doubled on Monday, finishing the day up 120%. The company said this morning that a phase 3 study of its Epidiolex investigational medicine for treating Dravet syndrome achieved its primary endpoint, significantly reducing convulsive seizures associated with the rare form of epilepsy. In investors' eyes, the announcement validated GW Pharma's use of pharmaceutical cannabidiol, and many seem to believe that further potential uses of Epidiolex for treating others forms of epilepsy, including Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, could add up to long-term success for the company. The move marks a huge reversal of fortune for GW Pharma, which had seen its shares lose two-thirds of their value since last summer because of a loss of confidence in marijuana-related stocks generally.

            ","I'm not exaggerating when I say that 2016 is a make-or-break year for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The struggling chip company, dragged down by a slumping PC market, inferior products compared to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and major share losses to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market, is readying two major launches that have the potential to turn the tide. Here are three reasons why shares of AMD could rise going forward.
Regaining ground in the GPU market Prior to the third quarter of 2014, AMD was a strong No. 2 player in the discrete graphics card market, claiming a unit market share of roughly 40%. NVIDIA was the leader, but the gap between the two companies was modest. This changed toward the end of 2014, when NVIDIA's disruptive GTX 970, and AMD's lack of a response, led NVIDIA to consolidate its lead. During the third quarter of 2015, NVIDIA claimed a unit market share in excess of 80%.
Image source: AMD.
Both AMD and NVIDIA are expected to launch brand-new GPUs later this year, and with both companies using advanced 14/16 nanometer manufacturing processes after years stuck at 28 nm, the jump in performance and efficiency should be substantial. With such a low market share, if AMD can simply match NVIDIA in terms of performance-per-dollar, the company should be able to win back at least some market share.
Market share gains can't come soon enough for AMD. During 2015, the company's computing and graphics segment, which includes both GPUs and CPUs, posted a $502 million operating loss on $1.8 billion of revenue. If AMD manages to score a win with its Polaris GPUs, the company's financial results and its stock price could look quite a bit better a year from now.
Fixing past mistakes AMD's CPUs over the past five years, based on the Bulldozer microarchitecture and its various revisions, have been a disaster for the company. AMD has been losing market share to Intel in both the PC CPU market and the server CPU market for years, driven in part by the fact that Intel's chips have held a major advantage when it comes to single-threaded performance. AMD is hoping to fix that problem with the launch of its Zen microarchitecture, set for release toward the end of 2016.
Image source: AMD.
With Zen, which will be built on a 14 nm process, AMD is promising a 40% gain in instructions per second, a measure of single-threaded performance. With Intel delaying the launch of its 10 nm manufacturing process, the manufacturing process gap that AMD has been subject to for quite some time will narrow substantially. Intel may finally face real competition in the PC CPU market and, eventually, in the server CPU market.
This all assumes that Zen is launched on time, and that AMD achieves the promised performance gains. If Zen fails to win back a meaningful amount of market share from Intel, it's difficult to imagine a scenario where AMD returns to profitability. New graphics cards will help, but both the GPU and CPU businesses will need to improve in order erase the massive losses AMD posted in 2015. If Zen lives up to the hype, it would be a very strong sign that AMD's turnaround is for real, and that could send the stock soaring.
Winning more semi-custom deals The only bright spot for AMD over the past couple of years has been its semi-custom business, which at the moment is comprised of SoCs that power the major game consoles. AMD has announced three additional semi-custom wins, and revenue from some of those deals will begin to be recognized this year.
Image source: AMD.
Going forward, as the current game console generation peaks, AMD will need compensate by winning more deals. The extra revenue coming this year will help, but diversifying the semi-custom business beyond game consoles is critical. There's no guarantee that AMD's chips will power the next generation of consoles, and losing that revenue would be bad news for the company. During 2015, the semi-custom segment generated $215 million of operating profit on about $2.2 billion of revenue, making it by far the most profitable part of the company.
If AMD is able to win more semi-custom deals this year, it would go a long way in easing investor concern that declining revenue from the game consoles is going to be a major problem going forward. AMD needs to show that its semi-custom business doesn't depend solely on the game consoles, and if it can do that, investors may be more willing to bet on the company's turnaround.

            ","Graphics-chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported strong fourth-quarter results on Feb. 17, easily besting analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings. Robust demand for the company's gaming graphics cards, as well as solid performance from NVIDIA's enterprise and automotive segments, drove revenue to record levels. In fiscal 2016, for the first time, NVIDIA surpassed $5 billion in annual revenue.
There's a lot going on at NVIDIA these days, and management provided a more detailed look at the company's various businesses during the company's earnings conference call. Here are five key quotes from management, taken from the transcript provided by Thomson Reuters, that investors need to see.

No longer a chip company NVIDIA designs graphics processors, competing with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in the PC gaming market. But according to NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, the company is no longer simply a seller of chips:
GeForce is really not a chip business anymore; it is really a gaming platform business. When you think about it from a gaming platform business, it has to be thought of in the context of the gaming ecosystem and the gaming industry. It is $100 billion large. When you think about it that way and you drive the business that way and you create value that way, I think the prospects for our growth there is still quite significant.
NVIDIA has been building an ecosystem around its graphics cards for years. GeForce Experience, the company's software suite for GeForce owners that provides a variety of features, now has 76 million users. GameWorks, the company's suite of code libraries and tools aimed at game developers, has found its way into various blockbuster PC games, providing advanced visual effects optimized specifically for NVIDIA's graphics cards. NVIDIA's Shield devices, including the Shield Android TV console, allows owners of GeForce cards to stream PC games directly to their TVs.
This software effort, along with the extremely successful GTX 970, launched in late 2014, has led NVIDIA to run away with the graphics-card market. During the third quarter of 2015, NVIDIA shipped more than 80% of discrete graphics cards, with AMD a distant second. Just a couple of years ago, NVIDIA's market share was closer to 60%, with AMD a strong No. 2 player, with a 40% share. NVIDIA's strategy of building a platform, introducing switching costs that keep GeForce users from moving to AMD, has so far paid off nicely for the company.
Datacenter momentum NVIDIA's datacenter business, which consists of the company's Tesla GPUs and its GRID graphics virtualization platform, is still a small part of the overall company, generating $97 million of revenue during the fourth quarter, 7% of the total. NVIDIA is already the leading provider of accelerators in the high-performance computing and cloud-computing markets, but the company's focus on deep learning is starting to pay off. NVIDIA CFO Colette Kress explains:
In datacenter, inclusive of Tesla and GRID, revenue rose 18% sequentially to a record $97 million, up 10% year on year. This reflects the extraordinary rise of deep learning, a field in which we are now engaged with nearly 3,500 companies and organizations, as well as growth in the number of high-performance computing applications that are GPU-accelerated.
Just a few years ago, NVIDIA was working with 100 companies in the area of deep learning. That number has now ballooned to 3,500, ranging from web-services providers to industrial companies. IBM announced late last year that Watson, its cognitive computing platform, will integrate NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs, providing a 1.7 times performance boost. As the amount of data being generated, as well as the need to analyze that data, continues to grow, NVIDIA is in a good position to capitalize on these trends.
Virtual reality in the enterprise NVIDIA managed to grow all of its major businesses during the fourth quarter, including its professional visualization segment, which consists of its Quadro GPUs. When it comes to virtual reality, NVIDIA believes that the enterprise could be a major opportunity for the company. Kress explains:
Audi now has 20 virtual showrooms, with several hundred expected later this year, that lets customers experience new models, customize them in real-time, and take them for a virtual spin. In a very different application, a start-up called Surgical Theater uses flight simulator technology and multiple GPUs to allow surgeons to use VR to fly through a patient's anatomy and rehearse complicated procedures before making the first cut.
Virtual reality is graphics intensive, requiring powerful graphics processors to ensure that the frame rate remains both high enough and stable enough to not induce discomfort. It's impossible to predict all of the ways that VR technology will be used 10 years from now, but it's safe to say that NVIDIA's graphics processors have a good chance at playing a critical role.
Looking to the future A mass-market self-driving car is likely still many years away, but Huang believes that NVIDIA's DRIVE PX platform is well positioned to provide the necessary computational horsepower:
PX2 was really invented to allow OEMs to scale that entire range, from assisted driving all the way to fully assisted driving. And that is one of the reasons why we can support one chip all the way up to four chips, from passive cooling all the way up to integrating directly into the self-driving EV water-cooling system, that is quite available for most EV cars with liquid cooling. So I think that our strategy there is going to work out quite well. We add a lot of value. It is very algorithm-rich, it's very software-rich. And I think our DRIVE PX platforms is really quite state-of-the-art.
NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 platform, announced earlier this year, is extremely powerful. The deep-learning platform supports two discrete GPUs based on NVIDIA's upcoming Pascal architecture, as well as two next-gen Tegra SoCs, and is able to perform 8 trillion single-precision floating-point calculations per second. This kind of power is necessary to track a large number of objects, from other cars to pedestrians, as well as to generate a plan based on that information.
What the self-driving car of the future will ultimately look like remains uncertain, and there's no guarantee that NVIDIA's strategy in the area will pay off in the long run. But the DRIVE PX 2 platform is unique, and with NVIDIA already working with 70 companies that are developing self-driving car technologies, the company is laying the groundwork for what could be a very lucrative business.
A strong automotive pipeline While NVIDIA's DRIVE PX platform is being used to develop self-driving cars, the company's Tegra chips are already being used to power in-car displays in millions of cars. According to Huang, the company also has a strong pipeline of cars coming to market that include NVIDIA's technology:
First of all, our pipeline. We've talked about our pipeline several times. We've shipped probably 5 million, 6 million cars. We have another 20 million, 25 million cars to ship in our pipeline. So these are design wins that took quite a few years to have won, and quite a few years of engineering to ramp into production.
This pipeline gives investors a bit of visibility when it comes to NVIDIA's automotive business. During the fourth quarter, automotive sales grew by 68% year over year, to $93 million. With plenty of additional design wins already in the bag, NVIDIA's automotive business should continue to grow going forward.

            ","Over the past decade, chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) lost 95% of its market value due to its inability to compete against Intel in x86 chips and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in high-end GPUs. AMD tried to compensate for those losses by selling enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) SoCs for game consoles and data centers, but that strategy also recently hit a dead end. 

Source: AMD.
Last quarter, revenue at AMD's Computing and Graphics unit fell 29% annually to $470 million, and its operating loss widened from $56 million a year ago to $99 million. The EESC unit's revenue declined 15% to $488 million, while operating income plunged 46% to $59 million. Total revenue fell 23%, with a non-GAAP net loss of $0.10 per share -- down from a profit of $0.02 a year earlier. 
Looking ahead, AMD hopes that its upcoming Zen x86 chips will help it gain ground against Intel. However, those chips won't arrive until the fourth quarter of this year, and their ability to challenge Intel's upcoming Kaby Lake chips is questionable. Therefore, instead of betting on AMD's unlikely eleventh hour recovery, investors should check out two more promising chipmakers instead -- Nvidia and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
Why Nvidia is a better buyWhile AMD has fallen behind in both PC CPUs and high-end GPUs, Nvidia remains the market leader in add-in graphics boards. Research firm JPR reports that Nvidia's share of the worldwide add-in graphics board market rose from 71.5% to 81.1% between the third quarters of 2014 and 2015. During that same period, AMD's share slid from 28.4% to 18.8%.
A sluggish PC market hasn't hurt Nvidia the same way as AMD or Intel, thanks to its dominance of the high-end gaming market. Last quarter, Nvidia's GPU revenue rose 10% annually to $1.18 billion. Within that total, gaming GPU revenue climbed 21%, Quadro workstation GPU revenue grew 7%, and Tesla/GRID (server/cloud) GPU revenue improved 10%. During the quarter, Nvidia launched a new VR developer kit and a hyperscale datacenter ""deep learning"" platform to help web-based companies accelerate AI workloads.

Nvidia's mobile Tegra chips, which were marginalized in the mobile market by Qualcomm, received a big boost from the connected car market last quarter. Tegra sales rose 40% annually to $157 million, thanks to a 68% jump in automotive revenue to $93 million. During the quarter, Nvidia launched Drive PX2, an AI computer for autonomous vehicles. Volvo plans to test the system in a fleet of 100 XC90 SUVs next year.
These positive catalysts could help Nvidia outperform rival chipmakers in the coming year. The stock has rallied 38% over the past year, and it could keep climbing as demand for high-end gaming GPUs and automotive SoCs rises.
Why Qualcomm is a better buyWhereas Nvidia is a bullish bet with obvious strengths, Qualcomm is a beaten-down contrarian play. Qualcomm's stock has fallen 30% over the past year due to ongoing concerns about its chip and patent licensing revenue.
Qualcomm has been losing market share in mobile chips and wireless modems to cheaper rivals like MediaTek. Meanwhile, major partners like Samsung and Huawei started manufacturing their own chips instead of using Qualcomm's. Those problems caused Qualcomm's QCT (chipmaking) revenue to fall 22% annually to $4.1 billion last quarter as its operating profit plunged 49% to $590 million. 
However, there are a few catalysts on the horizon. Samsung has agreed to use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 chips in ""some"" of its upcoming Galaxy S7 devices, and Qualcomm recently launched new mid-range Snapdragon chips to counter MediaTek. Qualcomm is also aggressively expanding into new markets -- like data centers, drones, connected cameras, and cars -- which can diversify the QCT unit away from smartphones. 

Source: Qualcomm.
Qualcomm's high-margin patent licensing (QTL) business earns a 3% to 5% cut of every smartphone shipped worldwide, a fee which many OEMs and regulators have challenged. In China, where Qualcomm was fined and forced to lower its fees, some OEMs are still underreporting shipments to pay lower fees. The company also faces fresh probes in South Korea and Taiwan, its second and third largest markets. These issues caused QTL sales to fall 12% to $1.6 billion last quarter, and its operating profit to decline 15% to $1.3 billion. 
But on the bright side, Qualcomm recently inked several new deals in China to guarantee proper payments. Looking ahead, Qualcomm faces more headwinds than Nvidia, but I believe that its forward P/E of 10 and its forward yield of 4.3% should limit its downside from current levels. 
But do your homework firstNvidia and Qualcomm look like healthier investments than AMD, but investors should be aware of their potential pitfalls. Some analysts claim that Nvidia is overpriced, since its trailing P/E of 26 is considerably higher than the industry average of 22. Other analysts claim that Qualcomm's chipmaking and licensing woes might get worse before they get better. Therefore, investors should fully understand both chipmakers' strengths and weaknesses before buying any shares.

            ","For Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), 2016 will prove to be a pivotal year. The company continues to struggle, posting a massive $660 million net loss in 2015, which followed a $403 million net loss in 2014. AMD has seen its share of both the CPU and GPU markets disappear, and extremely weak demand for PCs is only adding to the pressure.
A few major developments will play out this year in all of AMD's core businesses, and it's not hyperbole to say that the future of the company is at stake. With that in mind, here are three numbers that will be extremely important for AMD in 2016.

Source: AMD
$1 billion The only real success for AMD over the past couple of years has been its semi-custom business. AMD supplies semi-custom SoCs for all of the major game consoles, based on the company's CPU and GPU technology. This revenue and profit have prevented the company's finances from deteriorating even further.
But even with strong sales of game consoles, AMD receives less per chip as time goes on. During the fourth quarter, for example, semi-custom revenue slipped 15% year-over-year, while operating profit tumbled 46%. Game consoles will not be a source of growth until the next generation of devices is announced, which is likely years away, and that assumes that AMD remains the only supplier.
The good news is that AMD has announced a few additional semi-custom design wins, and the company expects to begin realizing revenue from these wins during the second half of this year. The first two wins were announced in October of 2014, and AMD expects to generate a total of $1 billion of revenue over the course of three years. A third design win was announced last year, but details are scarce.
This new revenue should help offset declines in console SoC sales, and depending on how quickly console revenue falls off, AMD may actually be able to grow the semi-custom business. With the company's PC business still flailing, the semi-custom segment provides a much-needed source of revenue and profits for the company.
18.8% During the second quarter of 2014, AMD shipped about 40% of discrete graphics cards, with rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) claiming the rest. Since then, AMD has seen its market share collapse, driven by both disruptive products from NVIDIA and a lack thereof from AMD. During the third quarter of 2015, AMD's market share had slumped to just 18.8%.
The company has taken some steps to improve the performance of its graphics business. Late last year, AMD formed the Radeon Technologies Group, which now oversees graphics development for all AMD products, including discrete GPUs, APUs, and semi-custom chips. This separation could make it easier for AMD to spin-off the graphics business at a later date, although there's been no indication that the company plans to take that step.
This year, AMD will have a chance at regaining some of its lost market share. The company plans to launch a brand new graphics architecture, Polaris, toward the middle of this year, and the company promises major boosts in performance and efficiency. According to AMD, Polaris is substantially more energy efficient than NVIDIA's current Maxwell architecture, opening the door for AMD's graphics chips to power laptops and other small form factor devices.
That said, NVIDIA will be launching new GPUs of its own this year, based on its next-gen Pascal graphics architecture. Pascal promises major performance and efficiency gains of its own, and at this point it's impossible to say whether Polaris or Pascal will prove superior. AMD doesn't need to blow NVIDIA away in order to win back some market share, but the company's execution needs to be better than it was in 2015.
40% Toward the end of 2016, AMD plans to launch the first CPUs based on its new Zen microarchitecture. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is currently as dominant as it has ever been in both the PC and server CPU markets, thanks in part to AMD's previous Bulldozer architecture being a major disappointment. In terms of single-threaded performance, Bulldozer fell short of comparable Intel products by a wide margin.
Zen is expected to fix this problem. AMD has stated that Zen will bring a 40% improvement in instructions per cycle, a measure of single-threaded performance, compared to Excavator, the latest revision of the Bulldozer architecture. This is a big leap, and if AMD can both hit this target and launch Zen-based chips on time, the company may have its first truly competitive high-end CPUs in years.
If an AMD turnaround is going to take hold, 2016 is the year it will happen. With new semi-custom revenue and a chance at winning back some lost GPU and CPU market share, the string of big revenue declines may finally come to an end. AMD expects to return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second half of 2016, which would be quite the reversal from the same period last year when the company posted a non-GAAP operating loss of $136 million.
AMD will still post a net loss based on this outlook, given the $40 million in quarterly interest payments the company makes, but if AMD meets its goals, it would be the first true sign that the turnaround is making progress.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) reported its fourth quarter earnings on Jan. 19, and the market wasn't impressed. Sales fell 23% annually to $958 million, which narrowly beat estimates by $3.3 million. On the bottom line, AMD reported a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million, or $0.10 per share, which matched expectations. The company earned a net profit of $18 million, or $0.02 per share, in the prior year quarter.

Source: AMD.
While those numbers didn't miss expectations, AMD's guidance was bleak. For the first quarter, it expects sales to fall about 14% sequentially, missing expectations for a milder 6% decline. AMD blamed that unexpected drop on ""game console seasonality and a cautious macro environment in China."" Those comments echoed Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) similar warning of macro pressures in China and other Asian markets during its fourth quarter conference call. 
AMD's stock dropped 8% after the announcement, and the stock is now down 26% for the year. Looking ahead into the rest of 2016, can AMD bounce back, or will its stock fall even further?
What's wrong with AMD?Over the past few years, AMD has lost the x86 market to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and the high-end GPU market to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). According to PassMark Software, AMD's market share in x86 chips fell from 48.4% in the first quarter of 2006 to 20.5% at the end of 2015. During that decade, Intel's share rose from 51.6% to nearly 79.4%. As for add-in graphics boards, research firm JPR claims that AMD's share slipped from 28.4% to 18.8% between the third quarters of 2014 and 2015, while Nvidia's share grew from 71.5% to 81.1%.
Due to those market declines and the weakness of the global PC market, AMD's Computing and Graphics revenue, which accounted for nearly half its top line, fell 29% annually to $470 million last quarter. The business posted an operating loss of $99 million, compared to a loss of $56 million a year earlier.
Instead of competing more aggressively against Intel and Nvidia, AMD has been counting on its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit to offset those losses. That division produces SoCs for gaming consoles, servers, and other embedded devices. Unfortunately, revenue at that unit fell 15% annually to $488 million last quarter, while its operating income plummeted 46% to $59 million. AMD's guidance indicates that growth likely won't bounce back unless console sales accelerate -- which could be tough considering that the PS4 and Xbox One are already over two years old.

All-in bet on ZenLooking ahead, AMD's best hope is to play offense against Intel with its new Zen x86 processors, which aren't expected to arrive until the fourth quarter of 2016. AMD's current generation of CPUs, the Bulldozer family of processors, fared poorly against Intel's comparable processors in terms of single-threaded performance. AMD gradually improved the chips' single-threaded performance in several revisions, but it never closed the gap with Intel's comparable chips.
With Zen, AMD will increase single-threaded performance by increasing the number of instructions per cycle (IPC). AMD claims that Zen chips will offer a 40% improvement in IPC compared to the latest Bulldozer revision, Excavator, while supporting simultaneous multi-threading. However, it's unclear how well the 14nm Zen chips will fare against Intel's comparable 14nm Skylake chips, which were launched last September. Intel also plans to update Skylake with the Kaby Lake revision in the second half of 2016, followed by its 10nm Cannonlake chips in 2017. Those big updates could leave Zen in the dust.
Could AMD go bankrupt?Last year, Kerrisdale Capital Investment boldly claimed that AMD would go bankrupt by 2020. The firm declared that AMD's dependence on the stagnant PC market, where it has repeatedly been marginalized by Intel and Nvidia, would doom the company. The firm notes that AMD has diversified its business into new markets like virtual and augmented reality, but has failed to dominate a single market.
However, AMD likely won't go bankrupt in 2016. The company's cash and equivalents dipped just 2.5% annually to $785 million last quarter, and its total debt only rose 2.3% to $2.26 billion. No new debt should come due until 2019. AMD's non-GAAP free cash flow fell from $94 million a year earlier to $21 million, but at least it remains in positive territory. 
While these figures indicate that AMD won't go bust in 2016, they also indicate that it can't spend much money on R&D, marketing, or acquisitions to remain competitive. This lack of firepower could cripple its ability to battle Intel and Nvidia or expand into new markets. Therefore, the real question investors should ask isn't if AMD can survive 2016, but whether it will still be around in 2020.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported its fourth-quarter results on Jan. 19, disappointing investors with weak guidance and continued losses. A slumping PC market is taking a toll on the company, and while sales of semi-custom chips used in the major game consoles have been a saving grace, AMD is in a difficult position.
Despite the poor results, AMD's management is optimistic that the company can begin to turn things around in 2016. Here are five things management said during the company's conference call that investors need to know.
Semi-custom success AMD's semi-custom segment, which is mostly comprised of the chips that power the major game consoles, has been keeping AMD afloat as its core PC-related businesses have struggled. During 2015, the semi-custom segment generated more revenue than the computing and graphics segment, enjoying a segment operating margin of roughly 10%. CEO Lisa Su pointed to AMD's semi-custom success in 2015:
""We had record annual Semi-Custom unit shipments in 2015 and have shipped more than 50 million Semi-Custom APUs as a critical and trusted partner to Sony and Microsoft. Demand for gaming consoles looks strong through 2016, and we remain on track to generate additional revenue from new Semi-Custom business in the second half of 2016.""
AMD has announced a few additional semi-custom design wins other than the major game consoles, and these are expected to begin contributing to revenue during the second half of this year. Even though console sales remain strong, AMD receives less revenue per console as the console generation runs its course, meaning that the company will need these additional design wins in order to prevent its semi-custom segment from posting continued revenue declines. Total semi-custom revenue slumped 8% in 2015, despite record semi-custom chip shipments.
A return to profitability AMD expects the first half of 2016 to be rough. The company guided for a sequential revenue decline of 14% for the first quarter, far worse than analysts were expecting. But AMD expects things to get better during the second half. Su explains:
""While we expect revenue to be lower in the first half of 2016 compared to the second half based on the seasonality of the PC and gaming console businesses, swift and successfully executing our product and technology roadmap and plan to return AMD to non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of 2016 and generate positive free cash flow from operations for the year.""
A combination of new semi-custom revenue, the launch of the Polaris graphics cards during the middle of the year, and the launch of Zen CPUs later in the year should help make 2016 a better year than 2015 was for AMD. The company expects to return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second half of the year, although about $40 million of quarterly interest payments will likely leave non-GAAP EPS in the red.
Shoring up the balance sheet With AMD posting a net loss of $660 million in 2015, following a loss of $404 million in 2014, the strength of the company's balance sheet is something that investors should be concerned about. At the end of the fourth quarter, AMD had $785 million of cash and $2.26 billion of debt, and the company expects to burn through about $100 million of cash during the first quarter, according to its outlook. The company has previously stated that its target minimum cash balance is $600 million.
The good news is that AMD will be getting an influx of cash during 2016, thanks to the company's sale of its assembly and test manufacturing facilities. CFO Devinder Kumar explains:
""We expect to close that transaction in the first half of 2016 pending regulatory and other approvals and expect cash proceeds of approximately 320 million net of taxes and other expenses upon closure.""
An additional $320 million will give AMD a bit more flexibility, putting the company well above its minimum cash target, at least for a while.
Hoping for graphics gains Over the past 18 months, AMD has watched its graphics card market decline by half. During the third quarter of 2015, AMD shipped about 20% of discrete graphics cards, with the rest of the market going to rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). AMD's lackluster launch of high-end graphics cards during 2015 wasn't enough to turn the tide, and NVIDIA has emerged as the dominant player in the graphics card market.
Su is optimistic that AMD can regain some market share in 2016, thanks to the upcoming Polaris graphics architecture:
""I think as we go forward it's a combination of things, if you look at our investments in graphics, they really include both hardware and software. So the Polaris family is excellent from a hardware standpoint in terms of the performance per watt that we get, but we've a number of software initiatives that we started over the past couple of months and will continue and we see all of those contributing to graphics momentum.""
In terms of hardware, Polaris and NVIDIA's upcoming Pascal graphics cards should be fairly similar. One area where AMD has fallen behind in recent years is software, and the company hopes to correct that going forward. NVIDIA's GameWorks, a suite of software tools and libraries optimized for NVIDIA hardware that enable advanced effects in games, has been a thorn in AMD's side, with a variety of high-profile games launching with GameWorks support. AMD recently announced an open source alternative called GPUOpen, but the company will be playing catch-up to NVIDIA.
Zen in the data center AMD was once a major player in the server CPU market. In 2006, the company's Opteron CPUs accounted for about 22% of x86 server processors. Today, AMD's market share is essentially negligible, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) accounting for about 99% of x86 server chips. Su has high hopes that Zen will allow the company to reinvigorate its server CPU business:
""We have secured several key design wins with global OEMs for our Zen based server CPU and believe we can rapidly re-establish our presence in the data center when we bring our new products to market in 2017.""
AMD made a wrong turn with its Bulldozer CPUs back in 2011. Intel's chips were far ahead in terms of single-threaded performance, and one former AMD executive called Bulldozer ""an unmitigated failure."" Various revisions haven't solved the core problem, and AMD's server business has suffered greatly as a result.
Zen is expected to bring massive improvements in terms of performance. A 40% jump in instructions per cycle is expected, and if AMD can hit that target, the company could have a competitive chip on its hands. Intel's decision to delay the launch of its 10nm manufacturing process means that both Intel and AMD will be shipping 14nm chips at the same time, potentially narrowing the performance and efficiency gap between the two companies. The first Zen server CPUs are expected in 2017, and AMD hopes to quickly gain back some market share from Intel.

            ","Over the past 18 months, the graphics card market has experienced a dramatic shift. The fortunes of the two major players, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), have diverged, and NVIDIA now claims a unit market share in excess of 80%. This is up from about 60% during the second quarter of 2014.
The shift began in late 2014, when NVIDIA launched two graphics cards based on its Maxwell architecture. The GTX 970 and GTX 980, initially priced at $329 and $549, respectively, proved to be disruptive, forcing AMD to slash prices on its latest line of graphics cards, the 200 series. The GTX 970 offered roughly the same performance as AMD's high-end 290X, which was priced at $499 at the time, while consuming significantly less power.
It took until June 2015 for AMD to respond. The company launched brand-new high-end graphics cards, the Fury and Fury X, which only served to catch up to NVIDIA in terms of performance, while its 200 series was rebranded as the 300 series, bringing minor performance gains. By this time, NVIDIA's market share had reached a dominant level, and while the lackluster launch stanched the bleeding for AMD and stabilized its market share, the new status quo heavily favored NVIDIA.
If there's one chart that demonstrates NVIDIA's dominance, as well as the predicament that AMD finds itself in, it's this one:

Data source: Valve.
Valve, the company behind the Steam PC gaming platform, tracks the hardware that Steam users own through its Hardware & Software Survey. This data is a poor representation of the PC market as a whole, but given that Steam users are by definition gamers, it should be fairly representative of the PC gaming market.
The chart above shows all of the DirectX 11 graphics cards that registered at least a 2% share of Steam users during December 2015. NVIDIA's GTX 970 is at the top of the heap, and it's only been getting more popular, rising nearly one percentage point since August despite the card being well over a year old. Intel's integrated graphics also have a strong presence, a testament to the improvements Intel has made in the area of graphics over the past few years.
Meanwhile, only the 7900 series from AMD, which includes three different cards launched in 2012, managed to make it on the graph. The entire 200 series from AMD had a share of just 1.57%. AMD's 300 series doesn't make an appearance at all -- it may be rolled into the 200 series' numbers, since they're essentially the same cards, but either way, it's clear that the launch has had little effect on NVIDIA's dominance.
It wasn't always like this. Here's the same chart for December 2011:

Data source: Valve via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.
In late 2011, DirectX 11 graphics cards were the minority on Steam, but this data gives us a good idea of what PC gamers were buying at the time. As you can see, AMD had a much stronger presence, claiming the top spot along with eight of the 15 most popular graphics cards.
The popularity of AMD graphics cards among Steam users has slumped by nearly one-third over the past four years. From December 2011 to December 2015, AMD's total share on Steam fell from 38.86% to 26.63%, holding up better than its share of the graphics card market only because of the continued use of its legacy products, many of which the company no longer supports with driver updates.
The situation is dire for AMD, but a comeback isn't out of the question. Both AMD and NVIDIA plan to launch new lines of graphics cards this year, and both are promising big gains in performance and efficiency. Both NVIDIA's Pascal and AMD's Polaris GPUs will be built on newer nodes, with NVIDIA reportedly using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's 16-nanometer process, and AMD using both Taiwan Semi's 16-nanometer process and GlobalFoundries' 14-nanometer process. Both companies have been stuck at 28 nanometers for years, so this change alone should help boost efficiency.
Both NVIDIA and AMD will also be using the second generation of high-bandwidth memory, which promises dramatic improvements in memory bandwidth. This will be important as virtual reality and 4K displays become more common, as the number of pixels per second needing to be processed, as well as the amount of data in general, will be substantially higher.
For AMD, 2016 will be a big year for its graphic business. The company will need to launch Polaris on time, and its graphics cards will need to at least match NVIDIA's efforts in order for the company to gain back any market share. Another disappointing launch, like the one we saw in 2015, could be catastrophic for AMD.

            ","What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soared on Thursday, two days after reporting mixed fourth-quarter results and providing disappointing guidance for the first quarter. While there was no specific news driving the rise in AMD shares, the jump is a continuation of the volatility that has gripped the stock over the past year. As of 11:30 a.m. ET, shares were up about 16%.

AMD data by YCharts.
So what: AMD had a difficult 2015, with revenue and profits plunging due to market-share losses and a weak PC market. The company issued optimistic guidance for the second half of 2015 in May, but the stock plunged once it became clear that the company's results would fall far short. Toward the end of 2015, the stock nearly doubled in just a few months for no apparent reason, only to collapse in the new year.
AMD stock sank following the company's fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan. 19. The company's results were mostly in line with expectations, but guidance calling for a larger-than-expected revenue decline during the first quarter gave investors pause. AMD does expect to grow revenue in 2016 while returning to non-GAAP profitability, but the stock sold off regardless. The rise on Thursday, which more than made up for the post-earnings drop, could simply be a reaction to the stock having dropped so quickly. Prior to Thursday's gains, shares of AMD were down nearly 40% year to date.
Now what: The volatility in AMD's stock price reflects the uncertainty surrounding the company. AMD has posted a non-GAAP loss for four quarters in a row, and while new GPUs and CPUs are expected this year, the company's results are unlikely to improve until these new products are released. Even then, AMD's track record is far from stellar, with the company having a history of over-promising and under-delivering.
Investors shouldn't pay much attention to these volatile swings. Instead, the fundamentals and the long-term prospects of the company should be what determines whether AMD deserves an investment. While there's no guarantee that AMD's turnaround efforts will succeed, the stock will likely remain volatile in 2016.

It's rare when a 250-point drop for the Dow Jones Industrials can be considered a good day. But given that the Dow was down as much as 565 points earlier in the session on Wednesday, the fact that the stock market bounced back to cut its losses by more than half at least cushioned the blow somewhat. Investors continue to worry about the global economy and some of the macroeconomic implications of recent moves in various financial markets, and market participants increasingly believe that a full-blown bear market might be necessary to give buyers enough incentive to start bargain-hunting. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL), and Teekay (NYSE:TK) were among the biggest losers in the market on Wednesday.
Advanced Micro Devices dropped 8% in the first day of trading following its fourth-quarter earnings report on Tuesday night. The chipmaker said that its revenue dropped 23% to $958 million, producing a net loss of $102 million or $0.13 per share. On an adjusted basis, losses of $0.10 per share were in line with expectations. But the problem that AMD faces is that investors see red ink persisting until at least the end of 2017, and that leaves the chipmaker on the outside of any advances in technology that could come over the next couple of years. With AMD expecting a 14% drop in revenue for the first quarter of 2016, shareholders have to wonder if they'll have the patience to wait out any potential rebound for the tech company in the future.
Seadrill sank 12% after the offshore drilling specialist got downgraded by analysts at Merrill Lynch. Wednesday was another tough day for the energy markets, with oil falling briefly nearly to $26 per barrel before recovering slightly. The main problem that Seadrill faces is that even though it has some of its rigs under contract, renewals will be extremely difficult if oil prices don't recover between now and the contract expiration dates. Offshore drilling became financially viable when triple-digit oil prices were the norm, and so even a sustained bounce from current depressed levels might not be enough to get the offshore market back to where it was previously. Meanwhile, Seadrill faces substantial amounts of debt that it will have to manage carefully to have a chance of recovering when oil markets hit bottom.
Finally, Teekay fell 13%. The shipping-tanker company confirmed this morning that it would slash its dividend by 90% and pay just $0.055 per share on a quarterly basis. Given that Teekay shares sported a dividend yield of more than 30% before the announcement and that the company had preannounced its plan to cut its payout, investors generally weren't surprised that the company made this move. But plunging oil prices also likely had an impact. The big question is whether the drop in prices will mean less actual movement of crude across the globe, and whether future renegotiations of contracts will fetch lower prices. Depending on the outcome, Teekay could come through this tough spell relatively unscathed, and if that happens, today's share price could look like a massive bargain in time.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported its fourth-quarter results after the market close on Jan. 19, beating analyst estimates for revenue and reporting in-line earnings. Revenue continued to slump on a year-over-year basis, and the company reported its fifth GAAP quarterly loss in a row. Here's what investors need to know about AMD's earnings.
Earnings rundown AMD reported fourth-quarter revenue of $958 million, down 22.7% year over year, and down 9.6% compared to the third quarter. The Computing and Graphics segment, which includes PC CPUs and GPUs, suffered a 29% year-over-year revenue decline, generating revenue of $470 million.
The good news is that AMD managed to grow sales in this segment compared to the third quarter, posting 11% sequential revenue growth driven by higher notebook processor sales. The bad news is that the segment still generated a hefty $99 million operating loss. This is, however, an improvement compared to the third quarter, when AMD reported an operating loss of $181 million, including a $65 million inventory write-off charge.
The Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment, which is mostly comprised of SoCs that go into the major game consoles, suffered an expected revenue decline, given that game console revenue peaks in the third quarter for AMD. The segment generated sales of $488 million, down 15.4% year over year, and down 23.4% compared to the third quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower game console royalties, which is not unexpected, since AMD gets less revenue per game console over time. Operating income was $59 million, down from $109 million during the fourth quarter of 2014.
Overall, AMD reported a GAAP operating loss of $49 million and a GAAP net loss of $102 million, or $0.13 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, an operating loss of $39 million and a net loss of $79 million mark an improvement compared to the third quarter, but are still a far cry from the non-GAAP profits AMD posted during the fourth quarter of 2014.
Looking forward, AMD expects revenue to decline by 14% sequentially during the first quarter to about $824 million. This represents a 20% year-over-year revenue decline.
Not much to like It was widely expected that AMD was going to have a bad fourth quarter, but it's no doubt disappointing that the company expects revenue to decline by so much during the first quarter. Analysts were expecting AMD to guide for a 6% sequential revenue decline, and this weak guidance sent the stock tumbling in after-hours trading. AMD blamed game console seasonality, as well as macro issues in China, for the weak guidance.
Despite weak guidance for the first quarter, the company has guided for revenue to grow in 2016 compared to 2015, in addition to a return to non-GAAP profitability in the second half of the year. Hitting these goals will require AMD's upcoming Polaris GPUs and Zen CPUs to both launch on time and lead to market share gains. The new GPUs are expected in the middle of the year, while Zen is expected to launch toward the end of the year.
Before investors get too excited about AMD's full-year guidance, I'd like to remind everyone about AMD's Financial Analyst Day event last May. During that event, the company guided for a 15% increase in revenue during the second half of 2015 compared to the first half, as well as a return to non-GAAP profitability.
That guidance sounded optimistic at the time, and the company didn't even come close to meeting it. Revenue during the second half of 2015 increased by just 2.4% compared to the first half, and the company posted a cumulative non-GAAP net loss of $215 million. I would take AMD's full-year guidance with a grain of salt.
A real turnaround isn't going to happen until AMD starts winning back some serious market share in the GPU and CPU markets, and that requires the new products slated for 2016 and 2017. The future of AMD is riding on the success of Zen, and the company can't afford to fall short this time.

            ","Shares of graphics-chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) soared in 2015, driven by market-share gains and positive financial results that diverged from the slumping PC market. The company's core gaming business is performing well, while growth opportunities in the automotive and enterprise markets provide the potential for higher revenue and profits going forward. Here's a look at three numbers that will important for NVIDIA in the coming years.
81.1% NVIDIA has been the leader in the discrete graphics card market for years, but its unit market share hovered around 60% from 2010 through the middle of 2014, leaving rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with a respectable 40% share of the market. This changed toward the end of 2014, when NVIDIA launched the disruptively priced GTX 970 and GTX 980, leaving AMD with no real competitor at the high-end of the market. During the third quarter of 2015, NVIDIA's market share reached 81.1%.

Data from Job Peddie Research.
AMD was able to stop the bleeding by launching new high-end graphics cards in the middle of 2015, but the launch was lackluster at best, leaving NVIDIA with the lion's share of the GPU market. These market share gains helped NVIDIA report positive results last year despite weakness in the PC market, leading to the stock rising 64% in 2015.
This year, both NVIDIA and AMD plan to launch new GPUs, and both companies are promising substantial gains in performance and efficiency. After being stuck using a 28nm manufacturing process for years, both NVIDIA and AMD are moving to 14/16nm FinFET manufacturing processes, and both will be incorporating the second generation of high-bandwidth-memory.
NVIDIA's massive lead over AMD, as well as AMD's string of quarterly losses that are straining the company's finances, gives NVIDIA a major advantage. While big market share gains are unlikely for NVIDIA in 2016, the company has a good chance at holding on to the bulk of its market share gains from 2015.
233 million One of the major opportunities for both NVIDIA and AMD in the coming years will be virtual reality. The Oculus Rift is set to be released this year, and while the cost of headset will be too high for most people, this first-generation device could be just a taste of what's to come.
The Oculus Rift will cost $599, on top of requiring a powerful PC with a minimum price tag of about $1,000. This PC requires a powerful graphics card, an NVIDIA GTX 970 or an AMD Radeon 290 at minimum, in order to process the 233 million pixels per second that the device churns through. That's nearly twice as many pixels per second as a 1080p screen running at 60Hz requires, so it's no wonder that a low-end graphics cards won't be enough.

Source: Oculus VR.
The high price of the Rift makes the device unlikely to drive increased sales of graphics cards, but it could cause some gamers to shift from lower-end cards to higher-end cards, potentially improving the mix and profit margins for both NVIDIA and AMD. If VR takes off and becomes more affordable, graphics card sales could get a boost in the long run, although at this point it's still too early to tell whether VR will truly go mainstream. If it does, both NVIDIA and AMD stand to benefit.
$836 billion The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that the total amount of economic loss and societal harm caused by automobile accidents each year is $836 billion. What does this have to do with NVIDIA? The company's Drive PX platform aims to bring advanced driver assistance features to cars, with the eventual goal of providing the processing power behind the self-driving car of the future. This number could be reduced dramatically in the coming years, driven by technology like that of NVIDIA.

Source: NVIDIA.
NVIDIA is far from the only company scrambling for its place in the self-driving car of the future, but its graphics technology is well suited for the task. Drive PX is a machine learning system, able to detect and track large numbers of objects from camera and sensor inputs by first training on an enormous quantity of data. Once objects are detected, a plan needs to be developed, and the 8 TFLOPS of computing power contained within NVIDIA's second-generation Drive PX system should be up to the task.
I think that a mainstream self-driving car is still years away – it's a really difficult problem to solve. However, advanced driver assistance features enabled by the kind of processing power and software that NVIDIA's Drive PX provides are a step in the right direction. ADAS systems have yet to widely adopted, creating a major growth opportunity for NVIDIA.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, Jan. 19, following the market close. With global PC shipments slumping 10.6% year over year during the fourth quarter, according to IDC, investors should brace themselves for disappointing results from the beleaguered company.
What analysts are expecting On average, analysts expect AMD to report quarterly revenue of $954.7 million, down 22.9% year over year. For the full year, revenue is expected to come in just below $4 billion, 27.6% below revenue from 2014. The average analyst estimate is right in line with AMD's guidance for a 10% sequential decline in revenue during the fourth quarter.
Analysts expect non-GAAP earnings to come in at a loss of $0.10 per share compared to breakeven during the fourth quarter of 2014. During the third quarter, AMD posted a non-GAAP loss of $0.17 per share, but this number included a $65 million inventory writedown. Excluding this one-time item, non-GAAP earnings would have been a loss of $0.09 per share.
Analysts are expecting things to get better for AMD in 2016. Revenue is expected to decline by just 1.1%, while earnings are expected to improve, albeit remaining negative. This isn't much consolation for shareholders, who have watched shares of AMD tumble by 72% during the past five years. But 2015 may mark the bottom for AMD's earnings.
Things won't get better until late 2016 Barring surprise market-share gains for AMD in either the CPU or GPU markets, there likely won't be much to like in AMD's fourth quarter earnings report. However, 2016 will be a big year for the company, with new GPUs and CPUs set to launch, in addition to the first recognized revenue from the non-console semi-custom design wins that AMD has announced during the past couple of years.
On the GPU front, AMD has lost considerable market share to rival NVIDA (NASDAQ:NVDA) during the past year, and while its launch of new high-end graphics cards in 2015 stopped the bleeding, the company has become a distant No. 2 player. NVIDIA shipped more than 80% of discrete graphics cards during the calendar third quarter, following years of maintaining a market share of roughly 60%.
Both AMD and NVIDIA plan to launch new lines of GPUs built on 14/16nm nodes in 2016, after years of being stuck with 28nm GPUs. The performance and efficiency gains from both camps should be meaningful. If AMD can put out competitive products on time, the company could claw back some market share from NVIDIA.
On the CPU front, AMD expects to begin shipping Zen-based CPUs in 2016, with the company hoping to make progress in the high-end client and server markets in 2017 and beyond. AMD is aiming for Zen to deliver a 40% increase in instructions per cycle compared to its previous generation of CPUs. If the company both achieves this goal and launches the products on time, Intel may have some real competition in the PC and server markets.
AMD investors should look to the conference call for details on both of these initiatives. AMD recently revealed some details about its upcoming graphics architecture, Polaris, confirming that the GPUs will be built on a 14nm FinFET process, and launch in mid-2016. NVIDIA will be launching its own GPUs based on its next-generation Pascal architecture around the same time, with the same kinds of performance improvements, so AMD will need to put out truly exceptional products in order to grow its graphics business in 2016.
With Intel delaying its launch of 10nm processors, Intel's manufacturing lead will narrow dramatically if AMD can launch Zen on time. Any comments during the conference call that suggest that Zen has been pushed back would be bad news for the company, as AMD's CPU business is essentially dead in the water until Zen arrives.
Lastly, investors should look for more details on AMD's semi-custom design wins. AMD expects to start recognizing revenue during the second half of the year, and with the current generation of game consoles expected to peak in terms of sales at some point during the next couple of years, this additional revenue will be crucial to growing the semi-custom business.
Another bad quarter A big revenue decline and continued losses will be the theme of the fourth quarter for AMD, but investors certainly have reason to be more optimistic about 2016. AMD is still in a very difficult position, and both its new GPUs and new CPUs could very well fail to gain enough traction to return the company to profitability. If AMD can launch compelling products, however, it could win back some much-needed market share.

            ","At CES 2016, struggling chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) took the wraps off of its next-generation graphics processor architecture, known as Polaris. Polaris represents the next step in the evolution of AMD's graphics processing unit designs, bringing architectural enhancements and a (much-needed) transition to a next generation manufacturing technology.
There's no doubt that Polaris will offer a significant leap in performance-per-watt compared to its prior generation graphics chip architecture. In fact, AMD took the opportunity to demonstrate that its upcoming Polaris chip can deliver substantially better performance-per-watt than NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) current generation GeForce GTX 950 (a fairly low-end gaming part).
However, I don't think either AMD or NVIDIA investors should get too worked up at this point. Here's why.
NVIDIA should get a big boost with Pascal, too AMD spent a considerable amount of time talking up the fact that Polaris is built on a new 14-nanometer FinFET manufacturing technology, which brings significant performance and power benefits over the 28-nanometer planar manufacturing technology that AMD and NVIDIA have been using to build high-end graphics chips since late 2011.
In fact, according to PC Perspective, AMD said that about 70% of the efficiency improvement that the company plans to deliver with Polaris is a result of the new manufacturing technology while the remaining 30% comes from architectural improvements.
That's all well and good, but don't forget that AMD has no monopoly on 14/16-nanometer FinFET technologies. Indeed, NVIDIA's next-generation graphics processor family, known as Pascal, will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE:TSM) 16-nanometer FinFET Plus technology (which Taiwan Semi's Mark Liu claims offers 10% higher transistor speed compared to the Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) 14-nanometer process that Polaris will be built on).
So, with the products that it will have out to compete with AMD's Polaris, NVIDIA should also get the big ""FinFET boost.""
Does this mean that Pascal will be superior? Only time will tell At this point, the performance battle between AMD and NVIDIA in the coming generation will be, as it was in the prior generation, decided primarily based on the quality of the GPU architecture, driver software, and more.
Right now, even though both companies are building GPUs on Taiwan Semi's 28-nanometer technology, and even though AMD is employing more advanced memory technology (known as ""High Bandwidth Memory"" or ""HBM"") on its highest-end ""Fury"" line of graphics cards, NVIDIA's graphics chips seem to be significantly more power-efficient than AMD's.
This points to NVIDIA having an edge when it comes to the underlying graphics chip architectures.
At this point, I am inclined to believe that NVIDIA will once again have the architectural advantage with Pascal for a couple of reasons. The first is that NVIDIA is starting with an arguably superior architecture, so unless NVIDIA decides to ""phone it in"" with Pascal, I'd imagine it will be easier for NVIDIA to maintain its lead than it will be for AMD to capture it.
Second, it's worth noting that NVIDIA's annual research and development budget is now well in excess of AMD's, as you can see in the chart below:

Source: YCharts.
Indeed, AMD's product portfolio is quite a bit broader than NVIDIA's so I believe that a higher percentage of NVIDIA's research and development spending is spent on graphics than AMD's. Couple that with the fact that NVIDIA is plain spending more, and it would seem that NVIDIA is investing far more into graphics than AMD is.
That said, investors should keep a close eye on how the Pascal and Polaris product perform relative to each other. If Pascal is able to maintain a similar lead over Polaris as Maxwell does over AMD's current lineup, then I would expect no meaningful change in the current market share dynamics.
If AMD is able to narrow the gap, then it could have an opportunity to retake share. And, of course, if AMD falls further behind, it stands to lose more of what little share it currently has in the stand-alone graphics chip market.
AMD has said that Polaris will begin shipping to customers in mid-2016, and I doubt NVIDIA will launch too much later/earlier than AMD, so it won't be long now before investors get a glimpse at how this next graphics card generation could play out.

            ","What: Shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) soared in 2015, rising by 64.4%, according to S&P Capital IQ data. All of these gains came in the second half of the year, driven by NVIDIA's strong earnings despite a weak PC market.  

NVDA data by YCharts.
So what: In May, NVIDIA reported mixed first-quarter earnings, providing revenue guidance that was well below expectations. NVIDIA's actual second quarter results, reported in August, blew past this guidance, with GPU sales rising by 9% year over year despite global PC shipments slumping 11.8% during the second quarter.
These strong results sent the stock soaring, and NVIDIA's third-quarter results were just as strong. GPU sales rose by 12% year over year in the third quarter, and NVIDIA's revenue and earnings came in well ahead of analyst expectations. The PC market remained weak, with shipments falling by 10.8% year over year, but this had no discernible effect on NVIDIA's gaming GPU business.
One thing helping NVIDIA perform well despite a weak PC market was market share gains at the expense of rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Prior to late 2014, NVIDIA had maintained a roughly 60% share of the discrete graphics card market. The company's share had risen to around 80% by the middle of 2015, driven by NVIDIA's disruptive Maxwell architecture and AMD's lack of competitive products at the high-end of the market. AMD finally launched new graphics cards in June of 2015, but the damage had been done.
Now what: With the same kind of market share gains unlikely to occur in 2016, and with NVIDIA stock trading for 25.6 times trailing-12-month earnings after backing out the company's net cash, NVIDIA's earnings may need to catch up to its valuation. The company has a variety of growth initiatives, including Tesla, its GPU aimed at supercomputers and high-performance-computing, and Tegra, its mobile SoC aimed mainly at automotive applications, but gaming GPUs are still the core of the company. NVIDIA is expected to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in early February.

            ","AMD RADEON R9 380. SOURCE: MSI
2015 was volatile for AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Shares of the beleaguered chip giant initially surged to start the year, only to tumble heading into the fall. But then, in the fourth quarter, AMD began a steady rally higher, and closed the year up roughly 10%.
The company's business has been similarly shaky. While it continues to lag behind its chief rival, Intel, in PC processors and struggles to remain competitive with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the graphics market, a new PC architecture coming next year (Zen) and the long-term potential of a new graphics architecture both offer hope for a better future.
Unfortunately, few of AMD's 2015 products stood out. But one in particular offered solid value. The Radeon R9 380X, launched in November, offers buyers solid performance at an attractive price.
Doing what AMD does bestIn recent years, AMD has struggled to match NVIDIA's high-end graphics processors in terms of pure performance, instead competing on value, offering quality cards at more affordable prices. But in 2015 it came close to dethroning NVIDIA. Announced in June, the Radeon Fury X is AMD's new high-end card, running on its Fiji architecture. However, while it initially appeared promising, final reviews proved less than satisfactory. Priced roughly the same as NVIDIA's competing 980 Ti, the Fury X comes close, but can't quite stand up to NVIDIA's card.
Instead, it's in the middle of the market where AMD excels. Retailing for around $230, the Radeon R9 380X occupies a niche between NVIDIA's roughly $200 GTX 960 and the more than $300 GTX 970. The Radeon R9 380X outperforms the GTX 960 for just a few dollars more, and while it can't quite match the GTX 970, it's much less expensive.
""The GTX 970 [is] quite a bit faster but also quite a bit more expensive then the R9 380X -- though still a bit of an overall spoiler like the R9 390 -- while the R9 380X will pass the 2GB GTX 960, albeit with a price premium of its own. At this point it's safe to say that AMD holds a distinct edge on performance for the price, as they often do, though as has been the case all this generation they aren't going to match NVIDIA's power efficiency,"" wrote Ryan Smith in his review for AnandTech.
An almost 80-20 splitThe R9 380X has only been on sale for a little more than a month, so it's hard to say whether it will help AMD claw back significant share from NVIDIA. Over the last several years, AMD has lost a sizable share of the graphics card market to NVIDIA, which now accounts for about 80% of the market. In the third quarter, AMD's market share rose slightly, but only to 18.8%. NVIDIA accounted for almost all of the remaining sales.
Still, AMD's graphics business remains intriguing, especially on the eve of what could be a revolutionary technology. Both HTC and Facebook are set to launch virtual reality headsets aimed at PC gamers in the first half of 2016. In order to take advantage, would-be virtual reality users will need PCs equipped with powerful graphics cards. Unfortunately, it's not clear if the R9 380X will be enough for those headsets. But AMD will undoubtedly refresh its lineup in the months and years ahead. If it can continue to own that mid-range niche, its cards could emerge as the affordable entry point to experiencing immersive virtual reality.

            ","There was a lot of bad news surrounding Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in 2015. The company's stock is roughly flat year to date, but during the past five years, shares of AMD have lost about two-thirds of their value. The various problems that the company is facing got much worse in 2015, but extreme pessimism was already baked into the stock.

AMD data by YCharts.
AMD competes against Intel in the CPU market, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market. The company lost considerable ground on both fronts in 2015. Here's a look at some of the worst headlines for AMD this year.
Graphics card market share collapses NVIDIA's launch of the GTX 970 and GTX 980 in late 2014 set the stage for a dramatic shift in the dynamics of the graphics-card industry. For years, AMD had been a strong No. 2, claiming a unit market share of about 40%. But in the third quarter of 2014, NVIDIA began to steal market share.

Data from Jon Peddie Research.
Following the first half of 2015, it became clear that this loss of market share wasn't just a typical fluctuation. AMD's lineup was disrupted by NVIDIA in late 2014, and the company was largely uncompetitive in the high-end of the market until it finally launched new products at the end of the second quarter of this year. As you can see from the chart above, this launch stabilized AMD's market share, but the damage had been done.
A disappointing launch There was a lot of hype surrounding the graphics cards that AMD launched in late June. The Fury and the Fury X both featured high-bandwidth memory, something that NVIDIA cards won't have until sometime in 2016. This was supposed to give AMD an advantage in the high-end portion of the market. Instead, AMD's high-end offerings failed to be disruptive, with the Fury X essentially matching the performance of NVIDIA's flagship graphics card.
The rest of AMD's lineup, the Radeon 300 series, were all rebranded versions of the previous 200 series of graphics cards. Rebranding is common in the graphics-card industry, but a name change and tweaked performance wasn't going to compel PC gamers to switch back to AMD. This launch stopped the bleeding, but it will take something far more impressive in 2016 for AMD to claw back some meaningful market share.
Things change fast On May 6, AMD held its 2015 Financial Analyst Day, where the company provided an optimistic outlook for the second half of 2015. At the time, AMD expected revenue to grow by about 15% in the second half compared to the first half, and for non-GAAP net income and free cash flow to turn positive.
Just two months later, AMD abandoned this rosy outlook, citing a deteriorating market for PCs. The return to non-GAAP profitability was pushed out, and both revenue growth and gross-margin guidance fell well short of what AMD originally expected. AMD reported a non-GAAP net loss of $136 million during the third quarter, and with analysts expecting a loss during the fourth quarter, as well, AMD is set to miss its goal of second-half profitability by a wide margin.
Can AMD mount a comeback? While 2015 was a disappointing year for AMD, 2016 has the potential to be better. In the graphics-card market, both AMD and NVIDIA are set to move to a 14nm manufacturing process. With both companies expected to launch new graphics cards in 2016, AMD has an opportunity to put out some disruptive products.
On the CPU side, AMD is expected to launch a new microarchitecture, Zen, in late 2016. Zen will be built on a 14nm process, and AMD is promising a 40% gain in instructions per second, fixing a major problem with its current CPU lineup. For the first time in quite a while, AMD and Intel will be on the same node at the same time, assuming AMD launches on time. If AMD can close the performance gap, the company could win back some market share, both in the PC market and in the server market.
All of this is easier said than done, and it's very possible that AMD's major initiatives in 2016 fall short. The company has a history of over promising and under delivering. Given the rate that AMD is burning through cash -- posting a free-cash-flow loss of about $350 million through the first nine months of 2015 -- time is not on the company's side.

            ","For graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), 2015 has been a fantastic year. The company's stock has soared, particularly during the back half of the year, with shares rising by more than 60% year to date. NVIDIA's main business, gaming GPUs, has done exceptionally well, and the company has managed to grow its market share to record levels, putting rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in a difficult position.

NVDA data by YCharts.
With 2015 coming to a close, it's time to take a look at some of NVIDIA's best headlines from this year.
Getting serious about cars With NVIDIA's efforts to crack the mainstream mobile device market largely a failure, the company's Tegra line of SoCs are now mostly being aimed at the automotive market. NVIDIA's chips already power the infotainment systems in a variety of models, including the Tesla Model S, but the company's ambitions go far beyond powering a few screens.
In January, NVIDIA unveiled two platforms aimed at automobiles. Drive CX, a digital cockpit computer, has enough power to drive the equivalent of two 4K screens, and NVIDIA is betting that cars of the future will contain a large number of screens that require some serious hardware to run.
Drive PX, which contains two of NVIDIA's Tegra X1 chips, is aimed at powering driver assistance and self-driving features. The machine learning platform can analyze data from up to 12 cameras in real-time, identifying objects like pedestrians, road signs, and other cars. A future self-driving car will need an incredible amount of computational power in order to gauge its surroundings and take action in a safe, reliable manner, and NVIDIA is positioning its Tegra chips to be at the center of this effort.

An Android game console While NVIDIA's GPUs powered the PlayStation 3, the newest generation of game consoles are powered by AMD exclusively. This hasn't mattered much for NVIDIA, as the company has stolen share away from AMD in the PC GPU market, shipping over 80% of discrete graphics cards during the third quarter.
Despite being absent from the major game consoles, NVIDIA is still making an effort to win the living room. In March, NVIDIA announced the Shield, a $199 set-top box running Android and powered by the company's Tegra X1 processor. This launch coincided with the announcement of a cloud game-streaming service, now called GeForce NOW, which allows Shield owners to stream a library of PC games from the cloud, with a resolution of 1080p and a frame rate of 60 FPS, depending on the strength of the user's Internet connection.

The Shield has been a blip amid strong sales of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, but NVIDIA's first set-top box could be just the beginning of the company's efforts to bring both Android and PC gaming into the living room.
Record market share NVIDIA and AMD have been slugging it out in the graphics card market for years, and from 2010 through the middle of 2014, the market shares of both companies were mostly stagnant, with NVIDIA claiming about 60% of the market, and AMD picking up the rest. There were fluctuations, driven by seasonality and new product launches, but neither company was able to steal much share from the other.
This situation changed toward the end of 2014, when NVIDIA launched the GTX 970 and GTX 980, two graphics cards that were priced disruptively, prompting AMD to slash prices across the board. This kind of disruption isn't uncommon in the graphics card industry, but AMD had no answer to these cards for about nine months. In that time, NVIDIA managed to grow its unit market share to a record 81.9% at the end of the second calendar quarter.

Data from Job Peddie Research.
AMD finally launched new graphics cards in June of this year, but the launch was underwhelming. AMD gained back a morsel of market share during the third quarter, but the damage had been done. With new products expected from both AMD and NVIDIA during 2016, the new status quo (NVIDIA having a dominant market share and AMD picking up the scraps) will require AMD to put out genuinely better products than NVIDIA in order to claw its way back. In the recent past, this simply hasn't happened.
It's been mostly all good news for NVIDIA in 2015, although there were certainly some setbacks, particularly related to Tegra and mobile devices. But overall, the company had one the best years in its history, and while the market share gains it achieved in 2015 won't be replicated in 2016, NVIDIA is well positioned to continue growing for years to come.

            ","It's no secret that 2015 has been a terrible year for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Revenue collapsed as the company lost market share to both Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market, a situation made worse by sluggish demand for PCs. AMD has reported a net loss in each of the last four quarters, and during 2015, the company wrote off inventory related to its APUs on two separate occasions. During the third quarter, revenue declined by 26% year over year.
Despite all of the problems AMD is facing, 2016 has the potential to be the best year for the company in quite some time. On the CPU front, AMD plans to launch a new CPU architecture, called Zen, toward the end of the year, promising major performance improvements. On the GPU front, AMD plans to revamp its entire lineup, doubling performance-per-watt in the hopes of being more competitive with NVIDIA. And on the semi-custom front, AMD will begin booking revenue for its latest design wins during the second half of 2016.
Zen could be a big deal AMD made a major misstep in 2011 with its Bulldozer microarchitecture, and its subsequent revisions haven't solved the core problem. In terms of single-threaded performance, comparable Intel processors vastly outperformed AMD's efforts, and the company's shares of both the PC market and server market collapsed. According to Bloomberg, Intel chips find their way into more than 80% of PCs, and Intel has a near monopoly in the server chip market.
Zen has the potential to make AMD competitive once again. The company is promising that the new chips will bring a 40% increase in instructions-per-clock compared to AMD's previous architecture, helping to close the performance gap with Intel. Zen will also be built on a FinFET process, most likely at 14nm. If AMD launches Zen on time, both AMD and Intel will be at 14nm at the same time, thanks to Intel's decision to push back the launch of its 10nm process to late 2017. If AMD can put out a competitive CPU, the company's market share could be due for a rebound in 2016.
Battling NVIDIA AMD has also had trouble in the GPU market. The company has been losing market share throughout 2015, and at the moment, NVIDIA claims a unit market share of about 80%.

Data source: Jon Peddie Research.
AMD's latest graphics card launch was mostly a dud. Its high-end products, the Fury and Fury X, failed to disrupt NVIDIA's lineup, and the rest of its new products were simply rebranded versions of older graphics cards. The much-touted high-bandwidth memory AMD included in its high-end GPUs failed to give the company an edge, and NVIDIA's gaming graphics cards continue to sell extremely well. During the third quarter, NVIDIA's gaming revenue jumped 44% year over year.
In 2016, both AMD and NVIDIA are expected to launch new graphics cards, and both companies are expected to move to either a 16nm or a 14nm process after being stuck at 28nm for years, in addition to using the second-generation of high-bandwidth memory. AMD has been playing catch-up ever since NVIDIA launched the GTX 970 and GTX 980 last year at disruptive price points, but if the company can release competitive products in 2016 alongside NVIDIA, it could begin to claw back some of its lost market share.
Semi-custom growth Sales of semi-custom SoCs for use in the major game consoles have provided AMD with a much-needed source of revenue and profits, helping to partially offset weakness in the rest of its business. This revenue will eventually begin to decline, however, as sales of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One peak sometime in the next few years. At the moment, the game consoles are the only source of semi-custom revenue for AMD, but starting in late 2016, that will no longer be the case.
AMD first announced two semi-custom design wins in late 2014, followed by a third design win earlier this year. The first two are expected to generate a total of $1 billion of revenue over the course of three years, beginning in 2016. During AMD's latest conference call, CEO Lisa Su confirmed that revenue from these products would begin during the second half of 2016. No details on the third win have been released, but it's possible it involves Nintendo's rumored NX game console.
With sales of the game consoles still going strong, and with new semi-custom revenue coming next year, 2016 is shaping up to be a solid year for AMD's semi-custom business.

            ","What: Shares of graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 11.8% during November, according to S&P Capital IQ data, driven by a strong earnings report. NVIDIA stock has been on a tear recently, rising more than 50% over the past three months.

NVDA data by YCharts.
So what: Despite the current weakness in the PC market, NVIDIA blew past analyst expectations when it reported its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 5. Revenue grew 6.5% year over year to $1.31 billion, beating analyst estimates by $130 million, while non-GAAP earnings of $0.46 per share nearly doubled analyst expectations.
NVIDIA's share of the discrete graphics card market has increased dramatically over the past year, and during the third quarter, the company claimed a unit market share in excess of 80%. This helped gaming GPU sales rise 40% year over year during the third quarter, and total GPU sales jump 12%. There were areas of weakness, specifically Tegra, professional GPUs, and data center GPUs, but NVIDIA's overall results were well ahead of expectations.
NVIDIA also provided guidance for the fourth quarter than was significantly higher than analyst estimates. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion, compared to a consensus estimate of $1.21 billion, and $1.25 billion of revenue during the fourth quarter of last year.
Now what: The PC gaming market has behaved largely independently from the PC market as a whole, and sales of GPUs, particularly higher-end models, are driving NVIDIA's exceptional performance. During the third quarter, IDC estimates that global PC shipments declined by 10.8% year over year. NVIDIA's OEM business is suffering as a result, down 45% year over year during the third quarter, but strong sales of gaming GPUs more than made up for this decline.
NVIDIA competes with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in the graphics card market, and AMD's recent struggles have been a boon for NVIDIA. Currently, AMD's PC segment is losing money, and its latest graphics card launch was lackluster at best, failing to disrupt NVIDIA's leadership position.
The continued success of NVIDIA's gaming business despite a weak PC market surprised analysts during the third quarter, and investors pushed the stock higher in November as a result.

            ","There are already various virtual-reality headsets on the market, including the Gear VR from Samsung and Google Cardboard, both of which work by inserting a smartphone into the device. These early VR headsets are inexpensive, but they're ultimately limited by the power available in a high-end smartphone.
The Oculus Rift, a VR headset designed by Oculus VR, now a subsidiary of Facebook, is set to launch during the first quarter of 2016, bringing with it a far more powerful version of VR. The Rift will need to be tethered to a high-end PC to function, meaning that the potential market for the first-generation version of the device will be limited to those with $1,000 PCs.

The Oculus Rift. Source: Oculus VR.
Two obvious beneficiaries of VR are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), both of which design the graphics processors that go into PCs. The Oculus Rift requires a PC with at least a GTX 970 from NVIDIA or a Radeon 290 from AMD, graphics cards that retail for between $250 and $300. If the launch of the Rift drives PC gamers to upgrade to beefier graphics cards, both NVIDIA and AMD could see a boost in sales.
The unique requirements of VR The Oculus Rift will have dual displays, one for each eye, with a total resolution of 2160x1200 and a refresh rate of 90Hz. The PC connected to the Rift will need to process about 233 million pixels per second, nearly twice the rate of a common gaming PC setup consisting of a 1920x1080 screen with a 60Hz refresh rate. It's no wonder, then, that a powerful graphics card will be required.
The Rift has another requirement: The rate that the connected PC produces frames should always be at or above the refresh rate of the Rift's displays. If the PC can't keep up, the result will be dropped frames and juddering. This isn't a big deal on a normal PC monitor, but for someone wearing the Rift headset, juddering breaks the immersion and could result in discomfort or motion sickness. For this reason, lower-end graphics cards won't cut it.
Because of the high cost of a Rift-compatible PC, not to mention the price tag of the headset itself, which will cost ""more than $350,"" according to Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey, it seems likely that early adopters will be those who already have powerful gaming PCs.
In other words, the number of graphics cards sold probably isn't going to increase dramatically because of the launch of the Rift. However, depending on how popular the Rift becomes, PC gamers who typically buy lower-end graphics cards may be enticed to upgrade to a higher-end product. For NVIDIA, high-end graphics cards carry gross margins in the 60%-65% range, compared with around 55% for the company as a whole, so a shift toward the high end could boost profitability.
The importance of software High-end graphics cards from both NVIDIA and AMD can handle the requirements of the Rift, but software may be what sets the two companies apart. Last year, NVIDIA launched GameWorks, a suite of tools, code libraries, and APIs aimed at game developers, and the company has been adding new functionality ever since. GameWorks allows developers to implement complex features, such as realistic shadows and hair, without having to build a system from the ground up. Naturally, GameWorks is optimized to work best on NVIDIA hardware.
GameWorks now includes the GameWorks VR software development kit, allowing developers to take full advantage of NVIDIA's hardware for VR applications. AMD has released something similar, LiquidVR, but the company offers no alternative to the full GameWorks suite. GameWorks has been used in a significant number of high-profile games, including Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Grand Theft Auto V, as well as popular game engines like Unreal Engine 4.
With NVIDIA claiming an 81% unit share of the discrete graphics card market during the third quarter, it shouldn't be surprising that many developers have integrated various GameWorks features into their games. AMD has been struggling in general, posting losses in each of the last four quarters as its market shares in both graphics cards and CPUs have collapsed, and a lack of resources will make it difficult for the company to catch up to NVIDIA when it comes to software.
The Oculus Rift has the potential to drive demand for high-end GPUs, and while both NVIDIA and AMD stand to benefit, NVIDIA appears to be in a stronger position. NVIDIA's market share dominance and its advantage in providing developers with software should give the company an edge in the VR battle to come.

            ","It is well known that in the world of high-performance, stand-alone graphics processors there are only two vendors left: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). NVIDIA has a substantial market segment share lead over AMD, with Jon Peddie Research reporting NVIDIA grabbed a whopping 81.1% market segment share in the most recent quarter.
I believe unless AMD slashes prices of its flagship Radeon Fury X graphics chip, which many had believed would be the struggling chipmaker's ticket to regain share against NVIDIA, AMD may actually lose share at the high end of the graphics chip market in the coming quarters. Here's why.
NVIDIA and its partners are getting very aggressive with the 980 Ti According to a number of third-party reviews, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti delivers roughly the same performance as AMD's flagship Radeon R9 Fury X. One of the problems for the Fury X, though, has been that GeForce GTX 980 Ti chips can typically be run at much faster speeds than what NVIDIA rates them at, which means many add-in board vendors offer GeForce 980 Ti-based graphics cards with a fairly substantial performance lead over the Fury X.
In contrast, it is widely accepted that the Fury X doesn't have much headroom beyond its rated specifications.
Early on, potential buyers would need to pay a premium -- in some cases, a substantial one -- for these ""factory overclocked"" 980 Ti cards. However, things have changed dramatically in the months since the 980 Ti and the Fury X launched.
Today, a Radeon R9 Fury X can be had for as low as $629, with most models sitting at around $650. That may seem fine, but it's important to note that on Newegg.com a factory-overclocked 980 Ti can be had for as low as $599 before a $30 mail-in rebate. NVIDIA also throws in a free game, to boot.
It's very hard to make the case for the AMD Fury X at this point in light of the very aggressive pricing on NVIDIA's part with respect to the 980 Ti. If AMD wants to have a chance of maintaining, let alone growing, its share at the very high end of the stand-alone graphics processor market, I believe it will need to cut prices.
Can AMD actually afford to cut prices, though? The problem for AMD is it may not have much in the way of room to cut prices while keeping its margins robust. Remember that the 980 Ti is based on a cut-down version of NVIDIA's GM200 GPU used in the $999 Titan X, while the Fury X is a full ""Fiji"" die. Given that these chips are roughly the same die size built on the same TSMC (NYSE:TSM) 28-nanometer process, NVIDIA's effective yields are probably better, giving it an inherently better cost structure.
At the same time, it's worth noting that the Fury X uses a newer memory technology known as High Bandwidth Memory (or HBM), while the 980 Ti uses a more mature technology known as GDDR5. I suspect at this stage of the game, GDDR5 memory is quite a bit cheaper than HBM.
All told, I believe it's cheaper to build a graphics card based on the 980 Ti than it is to build one based on the Fury X. This may make AMD reluctant to cut prices because it knows NVIDIA is much better able to handle a ""price war"" than AMD.
AMD's reasoning for not being more aggressive on pricing is it may as well extract as much revenue as possible from customers who prefer to buy AMD products anyway. 
AMD is in a tough spot As far as high-end graphics go, I believe AMD is in a bit of a bind. NVIDIA is typically viewed as the ""premium"" brand while AMD is viewed by many as the ""value brand."" In this case, though, it looks like the ""premium"" vendor is offering products with equal-or-better performance at competitive price points at the high end.
It seems as though NVIDIA has really ""won"" this round of the battle. Although some AMD bulls remain hopeful the tides may turn as the two companies introduce their next-generation architectures, the fact of the matter is that NVIDIA likely dramatically outspends AMD on the development of graphics technology.
I believe things will remain tough for AMD's graphics business for the foreseeable future in the face of NVIDIA's strong execution and sharper focus on the graphics chip market. In fact, AMD executives seem to be more interested in talking up the company's upcoming CPU core known as ""Zen"" rather than its next-generation graphics technologies. It doesn't seem prudent for investors to factor in material share gains in graphics as part of an investment thesis for AMD.

            ","During the second quarter of 2014, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) claimed a roughly 40% unit share of the graphics card market, with rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) leading the market with a 60% share. While AMD was behind NVIDIA by a considerable margin, the company was still in decent shape, and its market share had been flattish for years. AMD wasn't gaining any ground, but it wasn't really losing ground either.
Things changed in September 2014, when NVIDIA launched its GTX 980 and GTX 970 graphics cards. AMD was forced to slash prices on its existing lineup, and a new product launch for AMD turned out to be about nine months away. For four quarters in a row, NVIDIA notched significant gains in market share, and by the second quarter of 2015, toward the end of which AMD finally launched a new lineup of products, AMD's unit market share had cratered to just 18%.
During the third quarter of this year, thanks to those new products, AMD's share finally stopped falling. In fact, the company gained a bit of market share during the third quarter, according to Jon Peddie Research, claiming 18.8% of the market. This is still down substantially year over year, but it's the first improvement AMD has shown in over a year.

Data from Jon Peddie Research.
Unfortunately for AMD, the company's core problems haven't gone away. AMD is still posting big losses, with its computing and graphics segment, which contains both PC CPUs and GPUs, continuing to deteriorate. Even after killing off various extraneous initiatives, AMD still has too many balls in the air, attempting to compete against Intel and NVIDIA simultaneously with extremely limited resources.
Along with its latest earnings report, AMD announced that it was selling off its assembly and test facilities into a joint venture, a move that will raise $320 million in cash and prevent the company from falling below its minimum cash balance target. This gives AMD more breathing room as it looks to launch new CPUs based on its Zen architecture next year, but at the rate that AMD is currently burning through cash, this infusion won't last long. During the past 12 months, AMD's free cash flow has been a loss of $260 million.
At the end of the second quarter, AMD launched brand-new high-end graphics cards, the Fury and the Fury X, as well as a broader line of cards, the 300 series, which are rebranded versions of the previous 200 series. The Fury cards contained high-bandwidth memory, something that NVIDIA cards lack, and this was supposed to give AMD an edge. It didn't; the Fury X performed about the same as NVIDIA's high-end GTX 980 Ti for the same price.
Meanwhile, the 300 series cards didn't offer anything new, other than slightly better performance than the 200 series cards on which they're based. NVIDIA's cards have continued to sell well despite AMD's launch, with the company's gaming revenue surging 44% year over year during the third quarter, driven by both an increase in volume and a shift toward higher-end graphics cards.
According to Steam's hardware and software survey, NVIDIA's GTX 970, a $300 graphics card that's now more than a year old, continues to grow as a percentage of Steam's user base. In October, 4.45% of surveyed Steam users owned a GTX 970, up from 3.97% in August and 3.45% in June. For comparison, the entire AMD Radeon 200 series accounted for just 1.32% of users in October.
AMD is no longer leapfrogging over NVIDIA with new graphics-cards releases. Instead, it's playing catch-up, and while the company was able to halt its market-share decline during the third quarter with new products, it looks like these products won't be enough for the company to regain a significant chunk of the market share that it's lost over the past year.

            ","Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 23% in October, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. The designer of PC processors, graphics chips, and embedded semiconductors beat the market by a wide margin -- and also left arch rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) far behind.

AMD data by YCharts
So what: AMD entered October on a positive note, having recently announced a radical restructuring plan that was well-received by investors and analysts. That alone was enough to keep AMD trading significantly above Intel and major market indices.
Then, the company reported third quarter results in the middle of October. AMD missed Wall Street earnings targets, thanks to a large inventory writedown and set a low guidance bar for fourth quarter revenuee -- the stock slumped the next day.
But the disappointing report was quickly forgotten as independent research reports started painting the PC market in a brighter light, and AMD took off once again.
Now what: AMD bulls including Northland Capital Markets believe share prices could more than double within a year as the company rebuilds itself as a technology licensing center in search of big-ticker partner opportunities.
Sadly, that's a high-risk strategy. It's not difficult to find semiconductor experts with a more muted view of AMD's business prospects, but it's hard to beat the succinct overview provided by Bernstein analyst, Stacy Rasgon:
The company is raising cash wherever it can in order to survive until that game-changing chip is ready to, well, change the game. Meanwhile, Intel is crushing what's left of the ragged PC industry, and mobile challengers are still assailing that very stronghold from all sides.
AMD shares will bounce up and down while this battle for survival plays out, and October happened to be a moment of upswing for the company. But the end game still looks brutal, and I'm afraid the company doesn't have much gas left in the tank.
Write this month off as a fluke. It certainly wasn't the fanfare to begin a long-term victory march.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is in what would appear to be a fairly enviable position. The company is one of just two players in both of its core markets -- PC CPUs and graphics cards, competing with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the former and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the latter. But all is not well with AMD, and the company is struggling to survive.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported its third-quarter results on Oct. 15, and while the company managed to grow revenue compared with the second quarter, a net loss of $197 million was worse compared with both the second quarter and the same period last year. A $65 million inventory write-off related to its APUs, the second such write-off in the past year, weighed on AMD's bottom line.
Beyond the numbers, AMD's management provided some additional details during the company's conference call. Here are five things AMD wants investors to know.
Zen is on track AMD's upcoming CPU core, called Zen, comes with some lofty promises. AMD expects Zen to provide a 40% increase in the number of instructions per cycle compared with AMD's previous generation of CPUs, a performance boost that could make AMD more competitive against rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
AMD hired Jim Keller, a CPU architect, in 2012 to head up development of Zen. In September, news broke that Keller had left the company, prompting concerns that Zen would be delayed. AMD CEO Lisa Su tried to quell investor concerns: ""Zen remains on track for availability in 2016, and we believe will return AMD to the mainstream server and high-end client market in a significant way in 2017 and beyond.""
It's likely that the bulk of the design work for Zen is already completed, meaning Keller's departure may not have any real negative effects on the project. If Zen delivers the promised improvements, AMD could have a shot at regaining market share from Intel in both the PC market and the server market in 2017. AMD has been essentially shut out of the server market over the past few years, so the company needs Zen to be a success, as well as launch on time.
CPU design wins With Zen still about a year away, vast improvements in AMD's CPU business seem unlikely in the near-term. However, AMD is making some progress, and Su talked up AMD's role as the exclusive provider of processors for Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) newest business-aimed EliteBooks:
""We continue to have success with HP in the commercial market as they are seeing accelerating demand for their AMD based systems including increased adoption with key Fortune 500 accounts. As a result, I'm pleased to share that for the first time AMD was the exclusive launch processor partner for HP's newest EliteBook commercial client systems based on our latest Carrizo PRO APUs, which launched at the end of September.""
These AMD-powered EliteBooks -- the 725, 745, and 755 -- are priced well below previous Intel-based versions, with starting prices ranging from $684 to $774 on HP's website, compared with around $1,000 for Intel-powered models.
On one hand, design wins are a good thing. On the other hand, talking about individual laptop design wins is a sign of how far AMD has fallen in the PC market. During the third quarter, the revenue from the computing and graphics segment declined by 46% year over year, and while revenue was up 12% compared with the second quarter, it will take far more than the EliteBook to save AMD's CPU business.
More semi-custom revenue coming next year At the moment, SoCs that power game consoles are the only semi-custom chips generating revenue for AMD. It's an important business for AMD, which managed to get its chips inside both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. The previous generation of game consoles peaked after four years on the market, and if that trend holds up, 2017 would be the peak year for game console sales. Factor in ASPs on the decline for AMD, and its peak console-related revenue will probably occur a bit earlier.
The good news is that new semi-custom revenue is set to come online toward the end of 2016. ""Demand from Sony and Microsoft indicates that the record-setting sales pace of this generation of game consoles will remain strong,"" Su said. ""We also remain on track to begin revenue shipments of our additional semi-custom design wins starting in the second half of 2016.""
AMD announced a couple of semi-custom design wins earlier this year, and it expects the deals to generate about $1 billion of revenue over the course of three years. Coming at the end of 2016, the timing should be in the ballpark of peak revenues from the game consoles. Depending on how steep the console revenue decline ends up being, these new deals may simply end up canceling out that loss of revenue.
Monetizing patents Part of AMD's turnaround strategy over the next few years will involve monetizing its intellectual property. AMD owns patents related to computing and graphics, and Su expects the company to make an effort over the next few years to generate additional revenue:
""So in terms of our licensing our patents for our technology, we have done it from time to time, as I said, on a more opportunistic basis, and that's been both licensing technology as well as overall partnerships. As we go forward, we do believe that there is an opportunity to be more strategic in how we approach that, and that includes partnerships in certain markets that we are not directly building products out, for example, as well as working together with other companies that are interested in [access] to some of the markets that we are competing in it, so I think both are possible and I would say a strategic effort that we will take on over the next couple of years.""
Exactly what form AMD's efforts will ultimately take is unclear. The company could conceivably license its graphics IP for use in mobile devices, given that its presence in tablets and smartphones is basically nonexistent. It's also possible that AMD will sell off some of its patents in an effort to raise cash. Regardless, every bit of extra revenue will help AMD buy some extra time to turn around its core business.
Still committed to ARM There was an awful lot of hype when AMD first announced that it would be producing ARM-based server chips. Some viewed the move as a way for AMD to disrupt Intel's dominance in the server-chip market, and ARM Holdings itself expects to control about 20% of the server-chip market by 2020. Su's discussion of AMD's ARM ambitions, however, was fairly muted during the conference call:
I continue to believe ARM has a place in the data center, both as you think about toward the convergence between networking storage and servers. I think it's fair to say for all of us that it's been slower to adopt in the server market just due to the some of the software and the infrastructure. Relative to Seattle, we will be starting our first modest production shipments in the fourth quarter in this coming quarter this year. I view it as a longer-term bet, so no question that server market is attractive, data center is attractive, we're very focused on it from an X86 standpoint, and we'll continue our ARM efforts in a complementary way.
If ARM manages to stake a significant claim in the data center, AMD will be facing plenty of competition. Qualcomm is entering the server chip market, for example, and the mobile-centric company has far more experience building ARM CPUs, not to mention far more resources, than AMD. Keller was also leading the team developing AMD's K12 ARM CPU, which isn't expected until 2017, and his departure does bring into question AMD's ability to deliver a competitive ARM server chip on time.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported another big loss in the third quarter as it wrote down inventory and sold assets into a joint venture in an effort to raise cash. The company did manage higher revenue than its previous guidance called for, posting 13% revenue growth compared to the second quarter, but profitability continues to be a struggle. Here's what investors need to know about AMD's third-quarter results, which were released Thursday.
A look at the numbers AMD reported quarterly revenue of $1.06 billion, down 26% year over year, but up 13% sequentially. AMD's previous guidance for revenue was for a sequential increase of 6%, so on that front, AMD performed better than expected. The computing and graphics segment, which includes PC processors and GPUs, posted $424 million of revenue, down 46% year over year, but up about 12% sequentially. AMD pointed to higher sales of desktop processors and GPUs as the drivers behind the quarter-to-quarter growth.
Revenue from the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment declined by 1.7% year over year, but grew sequentially by 13%. Sales of semi-custom SoCs for the major game consoles peaked for AMD in the third quarter as inventory is built up for the holidays, so the sequential increase in revenue shouldn't be a surprise. In 2014, revenue in the segment slumped during the fourth quarter, and this will likely occur again this year.
Turning to profits, AMD reported a GAAP loss of $197 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to a loss of $0.23 per share during the second quarter and a profit of $0.02 per share during the third quarter of 2014. On a non-GAAP basis, the loss was a smaller $0.17 per share, flat compared to the second quarter. Analysts were expecting a non-GAAP loss of just $0.12 per share, although excluding an inventory writedown, AMD managed to beat that estimate.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP numbers include a $65 million inventory writedown, which had a negative impact of $0.08 per share. The writedown was due to lower anticipated demand for older APUs, marking the second time in the past year that the company was forced to write down APU inventory. I suggested that an inventory writedown may be coming when I reported on AMD's second-quarter results.
AMD expects its revenue to decline by 10% sequentially during the fourth quarter, which would put revenue at about $954 million. This would represent a 23% year-over-year decline.
Raising cash with a joint venture I suggested in my AMD earnings preview that it was likely that AMD would announce some sort of strategic move, and it turns out that I was right. AMD announced that it is forming a joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, with the JV responsible for semiconductor assembly and testing. AMD is contributing its Penang and Suzhou assembly and test facilities, which includes 1,700 employees, and AMD will receive $320 million, net of expenses, from Nantong, as well as a 15% stake in the JV.
AMD expects this move to be cost neutral while significantly reducing the company's capital expenditures. It will also raise some much needed cash; AMD has $755 million of cash remaining, not too far above its target minimum value of $600 million. This deal provides AMD additional breathing room, giving the company more time to turn things around.
Key takeaways AMD had a better third quarter than analysts were expecting, but the situation is still dire. The second inventory write-off in a year is a disaster unto itself, and being forced to sell off assets to raise cash is, while necessary, a sign that AMD doesn't expect things to get better anytime soon.
One bright spot was the sequential growth in the compute and graphics segment, driven, in part, by AMD's new GPUs. Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been stealing market share from AMD for the past year, and during the second quarter, AMD shipped just 18% of discrete graphics cards. AMD may have managed to win back some of that market share during the third quarter, although I doubt it was very much.
AMD's high-end Fury X graphics card had availability issues through much of the third quarter, and it failed to beat NVIDIA's GTX 980 Ti in most games. Most of AMD's other new graphics cards are rebrands of the company's previous cards with slightly improved performance, making a dramatic reversal of AMD's position in the graphics card market unlikely in the near future. NVIDIA is set to report its own third-quarter results in early November, and we'll know more about the graphics card market at that time.
The good news is that it appears that AMD's revenue is finally bottoming out. The bad news is that the company is nowhere close to profitable, and cost-cutting alone is not the answer. R&D spending has declined by 14% through the first nine months of this year, and while keeping costs in check is certainly important, slashing R&D is generally not the precursor to success for a tech company.

Get ready, Fools. If you own shares of Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), or Winnebago Industries (NYSE:WGO), your week could end with your stomach feeling like you just took a ride on the roller coaster above.
That's because all three of these stocks share two things in common: they are all heavily shorted, or have lots of investors betting against their short-term success, and they are all reporting earnings this week. When these two forces combine, volatility is almost always the result. For proof, look at the stocks I singled out last week, which moved an average of 13% following their respective releases.
But don't be (small f) fooled: I don't think you should try and profit from these swings. There's no way to tell whether they will go up or down. Instead, I think long term investors should check out the slideshow below to prepare for the week to come, and investigate what's really worth paying attention to.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is set to report its third quarter results on October 15 after market close. The company has been struggling to compete against the much larger Intel in the PC CPU market and NVIDIA in the GPU market, and it's unlikely that investors will be treated to much good news in the earnings report. Here's what to expect from AMD's third quarter results.
What analysts are expecting The average analyst estimate for third quarter revenue is $995.8 million, about 30% lower year-over-year. This is in line with AMD's guidance for the third quarter, which calls for 6% sequential revenue growth. AMD reported second quarter revenue of $942 million.
AMD doesn't provide guidance for earnings, but analysts expect the company to report a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.12 during the third quarter, down from a $0.03 gain during the same period last year. This loss will be even larger on a GAAP basis; during the second quarter, AMD reported a $0.17 per-share non-GAAP loss, and a $0.23 per-share GAAP loss.
A flurry of announcements There has been quite a bit of news surrounding AMD since the company last reported earnings. In September, the company created the Radeon Technologies Group, which will be responsible for the development of the company's discrete GPUs, as well as its integrated GPUs. Previously, the CPU and GPU teams were under the same roof, and this move may make a possible spin-off of the graphics business more likely in the future.
Later in September, it was announced that Jim Keller, AMD's chief CPU architect, who returned to the company in 2012 to develop AMD's upcoming x86 Zen CPU core and K12 ARM CPU core, was leaving the company. Zen is scheduled to launch sometime in 2016, with K12 coming in 2017, and I would expect AMD's management to offer some comments on this development during the conference call. AMD has stated that its public product roadmap would be unaffected by Keller's departure.
Layoffs at AMD were announced on Oct. 1, with the company cutting about 5% of its workforce. AMD has been working to cut costs during the past few years, but falling R&D spending has left AMD in a position where it's being outspent by NVIDIA. These layoffs come about a year after the company slashed its workforce by 7%. Management will need to convince investors that slashing costs won't imperil the long-term competitiveness of the company.
Rumors of a possible investment in AMD by a private equity firm surfaced late in September, with Bloomberg reporting that talks were on hold due to disagreements on price and strategy. AMD expects to still have about $700 million in cash at the end of the third quarter, but with the company burning through that cash, the pressure to shore up the balance sheet is increasing, especially with no sign that AMD will be able to return to profitability anytime soon.
Key things to look for I wouldn't be surprised if AMD announces that it is exploring strategic alternatives along with its earnings report. Possibilities include spinning off the graphics business, selling a minority stake, or even an outright sale of the company. The most important information for investors will not be the numbers -- those are sure to be disappointing -- but, instead, an update on the company's long-term strategy.
The CPU business is unlikely to meaningfully improve before Zen is launched, barring a dramatic resurgence of PC sales. Until then, AMD is stuck with products that aren't very competitive against Intel, and investors should expect continued losses from the CPU business. Sales of semi-custom chips for the game consoles will continue to partially counteract weak PC CPU sales, but it hasn't been enough to prevent AMD from reporting losses.
The graphics business could potentially improve for AMD during the third quarter. AMD launched a slate of new graphics cards at the very end of the second quarter, and while the launch certainly didn't light the world on fire, it's hard to imagine AMD's position in the graphics card market getting much worse. The company sold just 18% of discrete graphics cards during the second quarter, down from around 40% one year ago.
But it's also hard to imagine things getting all that much better. AMD's high-end Fury X faced availability issues for weeks after launch, and its entire 300 series of graphics cards are rebrands of the previous 200 series launched in 2013. That may be enough for AMD to win back some market share, but I wouldn't bet on a major reversal of fortunes.
The third quarter is likely to be another disappointing one for AMD investors. The stock has tumbled about 30% so far this year, and while any good news at all could very well send the stock soaring, given all the bad news already priced in, AMD will need to lay out a compelling long-term strategy to keep investors onboard.

            ","Back in August, there was some potentially shocking news for those who follow the graphics card industry. A benchmark using an upcoming real-time-strategy game called Ashes of the Singularity showed that DirectX 12, the newest graphics API for Windows, heavily favored graphics cards from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). I wrote back in July that DirectX 12 wasn't likely to benefit AMD relative to rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), but these benchmarks seem to fly in the face the of that argument.

Source: Ars Technica
That benchmark, done by Ars Technica , shows that AMD's R9 290X, a graphics card launched in 2013, performed considerably better under DirectX 12 compared with DirectX 11. NVIDIA's highest-end card did worse under DirectX 12, and it was very nearly eclipsed by the 290X. Amazingly, a $300-$350 GPU from AMD is producing almost the same performance as NVIDIA's $650 flagship in this benchmark.
The explanation for this surprising result is a DirectX 12 feature called asynchronous compute. In a nutshell, async compute allows a graphics card to process multiple streams of commands simultaneously, allowing the graphics hardware to be more fully utilized. This feature needs to be implemented in hardware, and AMD's GCN graphics architecture has supported it since 2011. Based on the initial comments from the developer behind Ashes, NVIDIA's Maxwell graphics cards performed worse when async compute was enabled, which suggests that the architecture doesn't support the feature.
This rumor that NVIDIA doesn't support async compute was eventually debunked. The second-generation Maxwell architecture, which includes all of NVIDIA's 900 series cards, does support async compute, but it wasn't fully implemented in the drivers at the time of the benchmark. AMD and NVIDIA implement the feature in different ways, but both companies support it.
A second DirectX 12 benchmark was released in September, this time using Fable Legends, an upcoming game built on the popular Unreal Engine 4. Anandtech ran the benchmark, and the results are more in line with what one would expect. In this case, NVIDIA's GTX 980 Ti easily wins out, beating AMD's high-end Fury X as well as the 290X. According to Anandtech, the benchmark does use async compute, although it may not be used as heavily compared to the Ashes benchmark.

Source: Anandtech
What it all means One thing to remember is that all of these benchmarks are based on games that haven't been released yet, on a graphics API that is brand new, and on graphics drivers that are very early. These results should all be taken with a grain of salt.
I'm sticking with the conclusion from my previous article: DirectX 12 is unlikely to disproportionately benefit either AMD or NVIDIA. Because AMD's GCN and NVIDIA's Maxwell have their differences, it's certainly possible for a developer to design a game that works better on one or the other. But with NVIDIA currently claiming a discrete graphics card market share in excess of 80%, it's hard to imagine that a developer would go this route.
DirectX 12 is not a silver bullet for AMD. The company has fallen badly behind NVIDIA, with its market share being cut in half over the past year, and its latest batch of new graphics cards have done little to change the story. As AMD struggles with big losses in its PC business, NVIDIA's GPU business is thriving despite a currently weak PC market. DirectX 12 will certainly be good for PC gamers, but it's unlikely to give AMD an advantage.

            ","In the market for stand-alone graphics processors, there are two principal players: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). NVIDIA is the market share leader and AMD is the underdog.
Although AMD fairly recently refreshed its desktop graphics processor lineup which, according to MKM Partners' Ian Ing, has led AMD to start clawing back market segment share in desktop graphics cards priced at $200 and $400, there is one area where NVIDIA continues to have an overwhelming lead over AMD: gaming laptops.
Gaming is increasingly going mobile, and NVIDIA has clear leadership High-end PC gaming has traditionally been the domain of desktop PCs. However, gaming has been ""going mobile"" as it has become more feasible to put very fast processors and graphics cards into smaller, more thermally constrained laptops.
Indeed, according to NVIDIA in a recent investor presentation, the market for gaming notebooks has been growing quickly, dramatically outgrowing the overall notebook market.

Source: NVDIA.
So, how do I know that NVIDIA has a substantial lead over AMD in gaming notebooks? It's quite simple, actually.
What happens when one tries to buy a gaming laptop? The easiest way to see the overwhelming lead that NVIDIA has over AMD in gaming notebooks is to actually go and try to buy one.
When I went to Newegg.com gaming laptop page in order to start my search for a new gaming laptop, I saw the following:

Source: Newegg.com.
It's not surprising that Newegg would have customers search for gaming laptops based on the kind of graphics chip that's inside; after all, the graphics chip is by far the biggest determinant of gaming performance in a computer.
What I did find a little surprising, however, is that all of the options on the gaming laptop landing page are NVIDIA based.
Even more surprising was that when dug a little deeper to see what AMD-powered options Newegg.com did have, I found just one: a refurbished laptop with an Ultrabook-class dual core CPU and a relatively weak Radeon R9 M275 discrete graphics processor.
Newegg isn't the only place to buy gaming laptops, but this does tell us NVIDIA is top dog here Now, to be perfectly fair to AMD, Newegg isn't the only place to buy gaming laptops; I'm sure if someone were dead-set on finding a gaming laptop powered by an AMD graphics processor, she or he could find it. However, it's pretty clear that the vast majority of gaming laptop designs out there are NVIDIA-powered.
This isn't by accident, either. NVIDIA's graphics architectures are generally regarded as meaningfully more power efficient than those from AMD. Given that laptops are generally power constrained, the efficiency of NVIDIA's graphics architectures allows it to deliver more performance in gaming notebooks than AMD solutions.
Can NVIDIA keep this winning streak up? A key question for both NVIDIA and AMD investors is whether the former will be able to maintain its product power efficiency lead over the latter. If NVIDIA can maintain this efficiency lead, then I'd expect it to continue to have overwhelming share of the GPUs sold into gaming laptops. If AMD is able to close the gap, then it could start regaining share.
NVIDIA has the advantage in that its current Maxwell graphics architecture is already more efficient than AMD's Graphics Core Next architecture, which gives the former a better base to build off of in future graphics architectures.
I also agree with fellow Fool Timothy Green in that AMD likely ""doesn't have the resources to keep up with NVIDIA.""
Indeed, NVIDIA's research and development budget is now significantly greater than AMD's, even though AMD is trying to build products for a much broader set of end markets than NVIDIA does:

Source: YCharts.
This seems to suggest that NVIDIA is spending materially more on graphics technology development than AMD is, which I suspect will translate into superior products from NVIDIA going forward. If that turns out to be the case, then NVIDIA should be able to maintain its high level of share in gaming notebooks -- as well as in the broader stand-alone graphics chip market -- going forward.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which has struggled to compete with much larger rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in PC and server microprocessors for years now, is betting big on its next-generation processor architecture known as ""Zen.""
Zen, according to the company, is expected to deliver a 40% improvement in performance-per-clock relative to its current Excavator processor core, the last in the line of processor cores derived from its Bulldozer architecture -- though AMD has not indicated at which frequencies its Zen-based processors will run.
At any rate, following the departure of AMD's Jim Keller, the now-former Chief Architect of Microprocessor Cores for the company, AMD issued the following statement:
Jim's departure is not expected to impact our public product or technology roadmaps, and we remain on track for 'Zen' sampling in 2016 with the first full year of revenue in 2017.
This statement has led to some confusion as to when products based on these ""Zen"" cores will actually hit the market. In this article, I'd like to clear up that confusion.
What AMD said at its investor day earlier this year AMD hosted an investor day back in May in which it outlined its product launch plans. According to that presentation, the first products based on the company's Zen processor cores -- aimed at high-performance desktop PCs -- will hit the market at some point in 2016.
These processors are expected to be pure CPUs rather than what AMD refers to as Accelerated Processing Units, or APUs; that is, they will not feature integrated graphics processors.
AMD didn't give explicit detail except for a leak by the reputable BenchLife.info suggested that AMD's plan is to get these first Zen chips into the market by the fourth quarter of 2016.
The statement from AMD doesn't contradict this I reached out to AMD's Drew Prairie and he confirmed that, per the company's analyst day comments, ""Zen will be available in 2016."" In other words, the statement that AMD originally gave wasn't indicative of any slip in the Zen-based chip schedule.
Why Zen is so important to AMD's future AMD seems committed to reestablishing itself as a major player in both the PC processor and the server chip markets. Although today's PC and server chips integrate far more than processor cores, the performance and efficiency of the core is central to the competitiveness of any chips aimed at these markets.
If AMD is able to put out a competitive CPU core with Zen, then the company might be able to halt -- and perhaps even reverse to some degree -- the share erosion that it is experiencing in PC/server processors at the hands of Intel.
Keep in mind, though, that this is a big ""if."" Intel has continued to invest heavily in its processor cores, and is even beginning to create different variants of its cores for different market segments. Developing cores that will ultimately be competitive with what Intel will have out in the marketplace in the late 2016 time frame and beyond seems a rather difficult task.
At any rate, I plan to keep a close eye on AMD's Zen project. If there is concrete evidence that AMD has built something competitive, then the company's fortunes might just be set to turn around. However, given AMD's uninspiring track record, I'll have to see it to believe it.

            ","AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) just lost one of its most important executives, Chief Architect of Microprocessor Cores Jim Keller. Keller, who resigned to pursue other opportunities, led the teams that defined AMD's road maps for CPU cores, systems IP, and server and client SoCs. CTO Mark Papermaster will take over Keller's responsibilities.

Source: Pixabay.
This isn't the first time Keller left AMD. Prior to leaving the first time in 1999, Keller helped develop AMD's Athlon K7 processor and served as the lead architect of the K8 microarchitecture, which both took a bite out of Intel's market share in PCs. A few years later, Keller became VP of engineering at P.A. Semi, a mobile chipmaker that was acquired by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2008. At Apple, Keller helped design its A4 and A5 SoCs for iPhones and iPads.
AMD finally hired Keller back in 2012 to design its next-generation Zen chips, which many analysts consider the chipmaker's last chance to strike back at Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the PC chip market. So does Keller's abrupt departure, months before Zen's potential launch, indicate that AMD could be in deep trouble?
Zen's uncertain futureAMD needs Zen to succeed, because its predecessor, the Bulldozer family, was a disaster. When Bulldozer launched in 2011, it couldn't compete against Intel's processors in terms of single-threaded performance. Subsequent revisions -- Piledriver, Steamroller, and Excavator -- boosted performance, but AMD failed to close the gap with Intel. As a result, AMD's share of the worldwide PC market fell from nearly half in 2006 to less than a quarter today, according to PassMark Software.
With Zen, AMD will boost single-threaded performance by increasing the number of instructions per cycle, or IPC. AMD claims that Zen will offer a 40% increase in IPC over Excavator and support simultaneous multi-threading. However, Zen might launch far too late to challenge Intel. A recent report at DigiTimes claims that Zen won't arrive until the fourth quarter of 2016 ""at the earliest"". 
Intel plans to update the recently launched 14nm Skylake with the Kaby Lake revision in the second half of 2016, then launch the 10nm Cannonlake in 2017. This means by the time the 14nm Zen arrives, it could be quickly marginalized by Intel's newer chips. AMD hopes to promote Zen to hardcore gamers first, but Intel PC Chief Kirk Skaugen basically said the exact same thing about Skylake during the Citi 2015 Global Technology Conference.
How badly could this hurt AMD?AMD tried to downplay connections between Keller's departure and the future of Zen. Speaking to Hexus.net, AMD stated that the company had already entered ""the completion phase of the Zen Core,"" and that Keller's departure was ""not expected to impact our public product or technology road maps"" and that the company remained on ""track for Zen sampling in 2016 with first full year of revenue in 2017.""
We won't know the full impact of Keller's departure until Zen launches, but we know that AMD desperately needs a hit product line to lift its ailing computing and graphics division, which has been crushed between Intel's x86 chips in PCs and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) add-in graphics boards. AMD's market share in add-in boards fell from 22.5% to 18% between the second quarters of 2014 and 2015, according to JPR. During that period, NVIDIA's share rose from 77.4% to 81.9%. 
Last quarter, AMD's computing and graphics unit's revenue declined 54% annually as its operating loss widened from $6 million to $147 million. On the x86 front, AMD is relying on Carrizo, its new Excavator-based APU, to support CPU sales throughout the rest of this year. On the GPU front, AMD hopes that its high-end R9 Fury X, which can render 3D graphics at 4K, can hold its ground against NVIDIA's top-tier GTX 980 Ti. But based on AMD's weak position in both markets, it's likely that its top- and bottom-line losses in computing and graphics will keep piling up.
AMD has big problems at the topAMD investors are probably getting used to big departures by now. Last year, CEO Rory Read was replaced by Lisa Su. Earlier this year, Computing and Graphics GM John Byrne, Chief Marketing Officer Colette LaForce, and Chief Strategy Officer Raj Naik all left the company.
However, Jim Keller's departure arguably hurts a lot more than those resignations. When AMD hired Keller back three years ago, Mark Papermaster enthusiastically claimed that Keller's ""innovative spirit, low-power design expertise, creativity and drive for success will help us shape our future and fuel our growth"". Unfortunately, it seems like that journey ended a lot sooner than AMD anticipated.

            ","Tech companies can never rest on their laurels. Technological advancement and disruption are ever-present in the technology sector, and even the most successful tech companies face the constant threat of being left behind. The history of the tech industry is a graveyard of once-promising companies that failed to adapt to a changing world.
Technology is a volatile and messy business, and for investors, avoiding the losers can be just as important as picking the winners. While dramatic turnarounds can certainly happen, with a company on the path to failure reinventing itself and finding success anew, betting on long shots is more often than not a bad idea. With that in mind, here are three struggling tech companies that, according to our Foolish contributors, may not ultimately survive. 
Andres Cardenal: BlackBerry(NYSE:BB)is scheduled to report earnings on Friday, Sept. 25. This report will provide an opportunity for investors to take a fresh look at the company's financials, but the main trends have been notoriously weak over the past several years.
Source: BlackBerry
BlackBerry reported $19.9 billion in revenue during the fiscal year ended in February 2011. Fast forward five years, and Wall Street analysts are expecting the company to deliver $2.5 billion in sales during the year ending February 2016.
The company produced $123 million in free cash flow last quarter, and the balance sheet has more cash and financial investments than debt. Total cash, cash equivalents, and short and long-term investments amounted to $3.32 billion as of May 30. Deducting $1.25 billion in debt, this still leaves BlackBerry with a net cash balance of $2.07 billion as of the end of the last quarter. Financial risk seems to be contained for the time being, but it's hard to tell for how long the company can avoid financial trouble if sales continue declining. 
BlackBerry is betting on software to turn things around, particularly focusing on the enterprise mobility management space. This sounds like a smart move from management, but transformations are seldom easy to implement, and BlackBerry remains a remarkably risky investment at this stage.
Tim Green: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)has seen its share of both the CPU and GPU markets collapse over the past few years. The company has been slashing research and development spending as revenue has declined, and the once-profitable business has now reported a string of big losses. During the second quarter, AMD reported a net loss of $181 million, with sales slumping 35% year-over-year.
Source: AMD
Deep problems plague the company. AMD CPUs can't match Intel in terms of performance, and the recent weakness in the PC market has put even more pressure on AMD's core business. In the discrete GPU market, AMD has been bleeding share to NVIDIA for the past year. During the second quarter, AMD shipped just 18% of discrete GPUs, down from about 40% during the second quarter of 2014. AMD's computing and graphics segment, which includes both CPUs and GPUs, reported a 54% year-over-year decline in revenue during the second quarter, and the only thing keeping the company afloat are sales of chips that go into game consoles.
AMD has enough cash, about $829 million, to keep going for a while, but with $2.2 billion of debt and no sign that these losses will let up anytime soon, a turnaround is looking increasingly remote with each passing quarter. The launch of new CPU chips based on the Zen architecture, planned for next year, is AMD's best chance at reversing the troubling trends plaguing its business. But Zen looks to be a Hail Mary for AMD; anything short of perfection may not be enough to save the company.
Steve Symington: Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN)shares have fallen more than 80% since its IPO in 2011, including a nearly 50% decline year-to-date. Though the online daily deals specialist still hopes to become a driving force in e-commerce, its most recent quarterly report saw Groupon not only fall short of analyst expectations for both revenue (up just 3% to $738.4 million) and adjusted earnings ($13.8 million, or $0.02 per share), but also reduce its full-year guidance for adjusted EBITDA by more than $25 million to $290 million. And though Groupon did achieve a quarterly GAAP net profit of $109.1 million, or $0.16 per share, that included a $0.21 per share gain from the sale of Ticket Monster, a Korean e-commerce company it incidentally acquired to propel international growth less than two years ago.
Source: Groupon
To be fair, Groupon would have achieved a more impressive 11% top line increase had it not been for the effects of foreign exchange. But the fact remains Groupon's revenue growth has largely stalled since it began selling physical goods in 2013 -- a move that bolstered sales at the time but came at the expense of previously cushy margins. And though Groupon hopes to make waves with the recent launch of its ""Groupon To Go"" food delivery service -- which offers up to 10% off every order and, according to management, expands its reach into a new $70 billion market -- it will need to displace entrenched competitors in the space like Seamless and GrubHub in the process. In the end, if Groupon's efforts to diversify here fail as the rest of the business stalls, I fear the stock will only continue its downward spiral.

            ","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently launched Skylake, its sixth generation of Core processors and claims that the new chips will significantly boost graphics performance and reduce power consumption across a wide variety of PCs. Intel claims that Skylake chips offer ""30 times faster"" graphics performance and enables laptop manufacturers to use all-day batteries, which are half the thickness and weight of current ones. It also supports next-gen features like wireless charging and facial recognition logins.
AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Intel's only meaningful competitor in the x86 chip market, doesn't plan to launch its seventh-generation Zen chips to challenge Skylake until next year. The Zen chips are designed by Jim Keller, a former iPad and iPhone chip designer whom AMD hired three years ago -- they also focus on delivering high performance with low power consumption. Many analysts see the Zen as AMD's last chance to make a meaningful stand against Intel, which has marginalized it in the PC market over the past decade.

The mistakes of the pastA rising AMD claimed nearly half the worldwide market for PC CPUs back in the first quarter of 2006, according to PassMark Software. AMD didn't just make cheaper chips, it launched 64-bit processors before Intel, while its dual-core processors received superior reviews. When it acquired graphics card manufacturer ATI later that year, it seemed like its integration of superior GPU technology into its CPUs (known as APUs) would crush Intel as it expanded into NVIDIA's backyard.
But then Intel struck back hard with new processors. The Bulldozer microarchitecture, which AMD launched in 2011, couldn't keep pace with Intel processors in terms of single-threaded performance. Reviews at the time claimed that Intel's processors had up to 50% better single-threaded performance than Bulldozer. Subsequent revisions to Bulldozer (Piledriver, Steamroller, and Excavator) gradually improved performance but failed to close the performance gap with Intel. As a result, AMD controls less than a fourth of the PC CPU market today.
Why Zen must be perfectWith the Zen microarchitecture, AMD will finally leave the troubled Bulldozer family behind and address its single-threaded weakness. To boost single-threaded performance, AMD can either boost the clock speed or increase the number of instructions per cycle (IPC). Since doing the former would inevitably increase temperatures and power consumption, it would be preferable to do the latter. AMD claims that Zen will offer a 40% IPC boost over Excavator with support for simultaneous multi-threading.
The first line of Zen chips will be the FX ones, which will have a high core count and support the newest DDR4 memory. These chips are expected to be marketed toward hardcore gamers, who flock toward CPUs with the highest performance. After that, AMD will launch the Zen chips for laptops, which will support DDR3 and DDR4 memory while focusing on power efficiency. AMD CTO Mark Papermaster has also hinted that the Zen architecture could eventually be used in everything from smartphones to high-end servers.
But it might not be enoughAMD hasn't set a firm launch date for Zen yet, but Taiwanese tech site DigiTimes recently claimed that it won't arrive until the fourth quarter of 2016 ""at the earliest"".
Such a late launch would put AMD at a huge disadvantage against Intel. First, Intel will get more than a year to promote Skylake to OEMs and consumers. Intel also plans to refresh Skylake with the ""Kaby Lake"" revision in the second half of 2016. This means that by the time Zen finally arrives, it will have to compete against both Skylake and Kaby Lake. The 14nm Zen could even end up competing against Intel's 10nm Cannonlake, which is expected to launch in 2017.
Intel has much deeper pockets than AMD. The company's marketing, general, and adminstrative expenses last quarter were almost equivalent to the last two quarters of total AMD revenue. With a much smaller marketing budget, it could be tough for AMD to effectively promote Zen against Intel's offerings.
Storm clouds ahead...For now, AMD investors are likely hoping that Carrizo, the new APU based on Excavator, which launched in June, can prop up its CPU sales throughout the rest of the year. Carrizo boosts graphics performance and battery life in laptops, but it sounds like the same promise Intel just made with Skylake.
In the meantime, AMD remains crushed between Intel in x86 chips and NVIDIA in high-end GPUs and reducing prices hasn't effectively boosted sales. Last quarter, AMD's Computing and Graphics revenue plunged 54% annually, and its operating loss widened from $6 million to $147 million. The launch of Zen could be AMD's last chance to strike back against Intel, but its delayed arrival and limited marketing budget could doom the chip before it gains any ground.

            ","Back in late June, KitGuru reported that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) might be interested in acquiring struggling chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The author of the KitGuru piece suggested that Microsoft could be interested in AMD to save money on its game console chips and/or develop smartphone- and tablet-oriented chip solutions -- two arguments that I wrote at the time didn't hold water.
Now, according to a new report from Fudzilla -- which recently claimed that private-equity firm Silver Lake partners is about to buy 20% of AMD -- Microsoft is ""seriously talking to AMD"" about a buyout. In that same report, Fudzilla also said that its sources ""suggest that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is interested in the acquisition of AMD.""
Although anything is possible, I think that neither of these rumored acquisitions makes very much sense. Here's why.
Let's start with Intel first There is a lot of overlap between AMD's and Intel's businesses. Both companies develop and sell processors into the PC market, and AMD has ambitions of once again becoming a viable provider of silicon into the server market, which Intel dominates.
If Intel were to buy AMD, it would essentially get a flailing discrete graphics chip business, a nearly nonexistent server processor business, a crumbling PC processor business (in no small part thanks to Intel), and a reasonably large -- but relatively low-margin -- semi-custom chip business, which is mostly a game console chip business.
One could reasonably argue that Intel could make good use of AMD's graphics processor technology, but I think Intel's organic graphics efforts have improved to the point where buying AMD wouldn't do the chip giant much good.
The only thing that seems as though it would be valuable to Intel would be AMD's CPU patent portfolio, which would include, among other things, the AMD64 instruction set extensions that Intel uses in its chips today.
However, even if Intel were interested in the AMD patent portfolio, it would probably make more sense for Intel to just buy the patents outright from AMD. Doing so would spare Intel from having to take on a business that's in poor shape and that overlaps heavily with its own offerings, and it would allow AMD to try once again to reinvent itself with the potential proceeds.
I think the odds that Intel outright buys AMD are practically nonexistent at this point.
What about Microsoft? Although Microsoft has made some pretty questionable acquisitions in the past, I think the purchase of AMD would potentially rank among its most outlandish.
The argument that Microsoft would want AMD all to itself for Xbox chips doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but there are some other potential ""synergies"" that I've seen discussed that I think also don't hold water.
One that I've heard is that Microsoft might be interested in picking up AMD to build (semi) custom chips for its cloud infrastructure. If Microsoft wanted custom server parts from AMD, wouldn't it just make more sense for Microsoft to hire AMD to build such chips, as it did with the game consoles?
That said, it's hard to imagine that AMD would be Microsoft's first choice for such a job, especially since Intel -- which has time and again proved its capabilities in developing server platforms -- has also said that it will do custom chips for large enough customers. Microsoft, in this case, seems a ""large enough"" customer.
As to the rest of AMD -- which boils down to PC processors and discrete graphics chips -- I can't imagine that Microsoft would want AMD just for chips to power its Surface line of tablets. And also note that Intel's low-power solutions here have consistently been superior to anything AMD has been able to cook up.
I also don't think Microsoft would want to get into the standalone graphics-chip business, especially when it's trying to sell gamers on its Xbox platform.

This was a short market week thanks to Labor Day keeping stock exchanges quiet on Monday. In the four days that remained, it looked like the bullas are back in town. The S&P 500 index rose 2.1%, a mere rounding error ahead of the Dow Jones Industrials' 2% gain. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite market barometer stole the show with a 2.9% rise.
But some tech stocks stretched the positive market tenor to extremes.
Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) almost missed the boat, but leaped to a massive 10.4% gain on Friday as buyout rumors emerged. Digital voice communications operator Inteliquent (NASDAQ:IQNT) started rising on Thursday, boosted by an investable nugget of information dropped during a public presentation. The stock recorded a 15.3% gain between Tuesday morning and Friday night. Finally, Chinese solar power generalist JinkoSolar Holding (NYSE:JKS) gained 14.3% thanks to landing a massive financial agreement with the Middle Kingdom's largest commercial bank.
Want to dig deeper into these market-beating tech stocks? Let's get started.

IQNT Price data by YCharts
Inteliquent wasn't doing much until Thursday morning, when CFO Kurt Abkemeier took the stage at an industry conference arranged by Drexel Hamilton. That event wasn't exactly scintillating either, until the executive dropped a piece of information formerly unknown to investors.
Thanks to a recently announced contract with T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), Abkemeier expects to record sales of ""solidly in the $300 million range for next year.""
The T-Mobile impact will be minimal in 2015, because it was announced so late in the year and will take some time to fully implement. That's why the payoff starts to arrive in 2016 instead.
Currently, Wall Street analysts expect Inteliquent to report sales of just $255 million next year, so this was a very material improvement -- and one that hasn't yet been included in the Street's financial models. That's one way to ignite a quick share price boost, and that's on top of the 30% surge the stock recorded when the T-Mobile deal was announced.
This stock has now soared 73% higher over the last 52 weeks, and still trades for a very reasonable 18 times trailing earnings. As it turns out, providing high-quality digital interconnections between different telephony networks can drive both strong profits and exciting sales growth. Who knew?

JKS Price data by YCharts
JinkoSolar started the week on a high note, coming in on a 6% tailwind as a major solar power rival reported disastrous results. Other solar stocks, including Jinko, rose on that news because this sinking ship is leaving more room for the surviving players in this rapidly evolving sector.
But things got even better on Friday, when Jinko added another 4% to its weekly haul. That boost came from a brand new financial arrangement, which will give Jinko a lot more room to maneuver over the next few years.
In a partnership with China's largest commercial bank, Jinko will have access to about $1.6 billion of fresh capital over the next three years. That cash infusion will just about double the company's debt balance, but will also allow Jinko to execute many projects it just can't afford on its own. The company will be able to scale up its solar module, panel, and materials production to the next level, and can also get started on large and capital-intensive installation projects that have so far been too expensive to even contemplate.
Jinko's shares have now gained 13% in 2015, just ahead of its largest China-based rivals. As always, the stock trades at bargain-basement prices, commanding share prices of just 8 times trailing earnings. Foolish solar market expert Travis Hoium says that this stock looks affordable after a recent plunge that had nothing to do with the solar power industry itself, and that Jinko's profitability makes it a de facto leader in the otherwise troubled Chinese solar market.
I can only agree, and add that the new financing only strengthens Jinko's long-term value.

AMD Price data by YCharts
Finally, semiconductor designer AMD started this holiday-shortened week very quietly, humming along close to all-time lows as it so often has done this summer. Fellow Fool Ashraf Eassa wondered whether AMD shares looked cheap or doomed at these prices, and after reviewing a business model he knows inside and out, he landed on the side of ""probably doomed.""
But on Friday afternoon, AMD's mood changed abruptly. The stock spiked as much as 16% higher before settling down to a more modest 10% gain by closing time. That also added up to a 10.2% gain for the full week.
The catalyst behind AMD's sudden jump? According to the veteran chip sector watchers of the  Fudzilla  blog, AMD is in ""serious talks"" with a potential buyer. Not one of the many semiconductor peers who have fruitlessly been rumored to pick the company up over the years, but a new name. This time, AMD is reportedly talking to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
With AMD under its belt, Microsoft would have full control over the main and graphics processor supply to its Xbox series of video game consoles, and also an in-house option to power future versions of its Surface tablets. It would also send the gaming console competition scrambling for new design options, since all three of the leading consoles today run on AMD silicon.
Now, even Fudzilla acknowledges that these talks may very well run dry before a deal is reached, and that a large semiconductor rival might be the more likely AMD buyer after all. But the mere rumor of a white knight on the horizon was enough to drive AMD's shares 10% higher in a single day.
This business is indeed in dire straits. CEO Lisa Su recently separated the graphics chip operations into a new reportable division, which led some observers to speculate that she might want to sell that segment separately.
Where the chips may land, nobody knows. But the time is ripe for big changes at AMD, and a wholesale buyout could certainly be an option. And even after this week's sudden pop, AMD shares have lost more than 50% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Get 'em while they're cheap, right?

            ","According to technology news website Fudzilla, struggling chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is ready to sell a 20% stake in itself to private equity firm Silver Lake Partners. Based on AMD's current share price, this works out to an investment worth approximately $300 million as of writing.
If this report is true, what might it mean for AMD's business and ultimately its share price? Let's take a closer look.
AMD could definitely use the cash In an article recently published on Fool.com, in which I outlined three reasons why I didn't plan to invest in AMD stock now, I noted that AMD's balance sheet -- particularly in light of the fact that the company continues to burn cash -- is in a precarious position.
By the end of the quarter, should it meet the guidance that it set forth at its most recent earnings release, AMD will see its cash balance drop to $700 million. This is just $100 million above the company's ""target minimum"" cash balance of $600 million. A few more rough quarters (and I don't see much on the horizon to suggest that things will get any better for the company over the next several quarters), and the company could find its cash balance below this ""target minimum."" 
A $300 million cash infusion for AMD, although not a fundamental game changer for the company, might allow it to last long enough to figure out a new, more effective business strategy. 
Near-term impact on the share price If the report of this investment in AMD by Silver Lake is true, the odds seem good that the share price could see a material move up following an announcement. Although such a deal would very likely dilute existing AMD shareholders, the financial situation at AMD appears so precarious that investors might look favorably on the improved liquidity that such an investment would mean for AMD. 
Potential long-term impact on the business If a private equity firm like Silver Lake were to take a substantial stake in AMD, my guess is that the private equity firm's chief focus would be on trying to restructure the business so that it is consistently profitable/cash flow positive. 
For example, it's pretty well known that AMD is trying to push into a lot of different markets, despite its limited resources. Perhaps with a large enough stake, Silver Lake could force management's hand in winding down certain product lines/product segments to cut costs and pushing the company to focus only on a limited set of opportunities with attractive risk/reward ratios. 
Indeed, the Fudzilla article states that it has heard that AMD is set to perform yet another round of restructuring. This should mean additional cost cutting to better align AMD's operating expenses with its current revenue run rate. 
This could be very interesting for AMD, if true One of the things that has been very unattractive about the AMD story is that the company seems to want to participate in a broad array of markets with fairly limited resources. This allows it to stand up and tell its investors that it's going after a huge total addressable market, but because AMD is trying to do so much with so little, it has been unsuccessful at competing with some of its larger and/or more focused rivals.
If Silver Lake comes in, gives AMD this rumored cash infusion, and essentially forces the company to become a leaner, more focused specialty chipmaker, then there could be some real value to be unlocked here over the long term -- even if AMD ultimately can't advertise as large of a total addressable market.

            ","Kirk Skaugen, the head of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Client Computing Group, which encompasses both the company's traditional PC business as well as its mobile business, recently presented at the Citi Global Technology Conference. During the presentation, Skaugen touched upon a number of topics that should interest current and potential Intel stockholders.
In this article, I'd like to go over the three points that I found most interesting from the presentation. 
Talking about 2-in-1 devices Skaugen made a pretty convincing argument that Intel's push to converge tablets and notebooks with 2-in-1 devices has been successful, with the key points visible in the following slide: 

Source: Intel. 
As indicated in the above slide, sales of traditional notebooks (which means no 2-in-1 devices) in North American retail have seen year-over-year declines for six straight quarters. 
However, the picture changes once sales of 2-in-1 devices are factored in. In the first two quarters of 2014, although total notebook sales in North American retail still saw declines even with 2-in-1 devices were factored in, the rate of decline was materially lower.
And from the third quarter of 2014 to the second quarter of 2015, notebook sales in North American retail with 2-in-1 devices included have been flat to up. 
Skaugen also indicated that 56% of the buyers of these 2-in-1 devices had thought about purchasing standard tablets instead. Although Intel does have a presence in tablets, the majority of the tablets on the market aren't running on Intel silicon, while the majority of 2-in-1 tablet/PC hybrids on the market are. 
Finally, 2-in-1 notebooks very likely have Intel's relatively higher average selling price Core-i series processors, while vanilla tablets either don't have Intel silicon at all or, if they do, probably use cheap Atom chips. So, from a revenue and ultimately profit perspective, the more that Intel can sway users from traditional tablets and to 2-in-1 devices, the better off its business should be. 
Skaugen wants to grow PCs, isn't just content with flat Intel's top brass have made it pretty clear at this point that they've accepted the harsh reality that the PC market isn't really a growth market. Indeed, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said during the company's July 15 earnings call that his long-term forecast for the PC market is ""relatively flat.""
In his prepared remarks, Skaugen said that his job at Intel is ""to grow PC, not to see it be flat which is kind of [Intel's] general public statement.""
One interesting point that he made was that the company has been able to register fairly consistent year-over-year growth in notebook platform sales (aside from the second quarter, in which sales plunged 11% year over year) despite headwinds from three of its top five countries: Brazil, Japan, and Russia are down ""20% to 40% plus.""
Although Skaugen shied away from trying to predict the macroeconomic situations in those countries, he expressed confidence that those markets ""will come back"" at some point in the future. The implication here seems to be that when PC sales in these countries recover, Intel's PC processor sales should benefit nicely.
Is Intel worried about ARM-based notebooks? During the conference, analyst Chris Danely asked Skaugen about his views about ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) processors potentially making their way into PCs.
Skaugen said that he thinks that Intel's competitive positioning with its Core family of processors is ""very strong"" right now. He also made it clear that as far as PCs go, he views Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) as its main competitor in PCs -- not any of the ARM-based vendors.

            Sep 9, 2015 at 12:00PM
            
            ","Shares of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) most recently traded, as of writing, at just $1.82 per share. At this price, the company's market capitalization sits at $1.42 billion -- a small fraction of what the company was worth in its heyday.
This ""low price"" seems to have attracted investors looking for what might be a ""bargain."" Indeed, a common argument that I have seen bulls give ultimately boils down to the idea that ""things can't get much worse.""
If that were the case then I would probably consider buying some shares and holding them for the next couple of years to try to capitalize on a reversal in the company's fortunes. However, I believe that there is room for things to get worse, perhaps substantially so, before things could possibly get better.
Here are three reasons why I'm steering clear of AMD shares for now.
The competitive situation in PC processors may continue to deteriorate One of the problems that AMD has faced is that its PC processor business has eroded significantly over the last several years. Part of this decline has been due to the fact that the overall PC market has been declining, but market segment share loss to much larger rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) seems to have been an even bigger driver.
I think that AMD will continue to lose share as systems based on Intel's Skylake processors come to market. I don't think the products that AMD will have during most of 2016 will do much, if anything, to improve its competitive positioning vis-a-vis Intel.
This means that AMD might be in for nearly another full year of share loss before new products hit the market that could potentially turn things around.
AMD continues to get clobbered in graphics The market for PC microprocessors isn't the only one in which AMD's competitive situation is less than ideal. According to recent market share data from Mercury Research, AMD's market segment share in desktop-bound, stand-alone graphics processors declined to just 18% during the second quarter of 2015 -- down from 38% in the year-ago period as rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) gained significant share. 
Although the company recently launched a new graphics processor known as ""Fiji"" in a bid to regain share at the high end of the desktop graphics processor market, the cards based on this chip appear to face very stiff competition from NVIDIA's competing offerings. 
Additionally, AMD appears to be facing supply limitations with its Fiji-based cards, which could further impede the company's quest to regain high-end desktop graphics card share.
AMD bulls will probably argue that the company's next-generation GPU architecture could end up being more competitive than its current offerings, but with both AMD's and NVIDIA's respective track records, this isn't a thesis I'd feel comfortable putting my hard-earned investment dollars behind.
A shaky financial situation In addition to competitive issues, AMD's cash flow statements and its balance sheet hardly inspire confidence. The company routinely burns cash, with cash burn year to date coming in at a whopping $187 million.
As if that weren't enough, AMD ended the last quarter with $829 million in cash and cash equivalents and projects that, by the time this quarter is out, its cash and cash equivalents will be down to just $700 million.
Considering that AMD CFO Devinder Kumar has said in the past that its target minimum cash balance is $600 million, the company seems to be getting awfully close to that.
If AMD can't dramatically improve its cash flow situation, then it may need to raise additional cash either by issuing additional debt (this may be difficult given AMD's poor credit ratings) or by diluting its long-suffering shareholders -- potentially significantly -- by issuing more shares in a secondary offering.
I'm keeping away for now At this point, I think there is further downside risk to AMD shares, particularly as I think the company's business could get worse over the next year.
If AMD makes it through the next year, and if the new products that the company launches across its various market segments look competitive enough to profitably regain share, then I would consider buying and holding AMD stock.
For now, though, I'm keeping away from AMD stock.

            ","Over on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Rys Sommefeldt, Editor-in-Chief of popular 3D graphics-oriented website Beyond3D and Business Development Manager at graphics IP vendor Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF), made the following very interesting ""tweet"": 
From a good look at Gen9, I now bet that Intel will get back into the discrete PCIe graphics card business with a Gen10 variant
In other words, he thinks that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) -- which currently only offers its graphics technology integrated onto its CPUs -- could use its next generation graphics processor design to enter the market for stand-alone graphics chips. Such a move would put Intel into direct competition with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). 
Although Sommefeldt makes the interesting point that there could be money to be made for Intel in this market, I don't think Intel will actually go ahead and do that. Here's why. 
How much of the market would really be open to Intel?If Intel were to enter the market for discrete graphics cards, it would -- as Sommefeldt suggests in a subsequent ""tweet"" -- probably make a play for the mid-range of the market. 
I'd argue that the business case for trying to compete broadly in the market for stand-alone graphics is a bit iffy. I'd estimate that the market for such chips is probably in the ballpark of $4 billion, with NVIDIA capturing the majority of it and AMD as a distant second.
If Intel were to enter the market, it would have to expend not-so-insignificant resources into trying to get its piece of a, perhaps, $4 billion pie. For a company that's on track to generate over $55 billion in sales this year, I'm not sure that this is all that attractive. 
The already-iffy business case for Intel to enter this market becomes even less attractive if Intel doesn't try to go for the high-end of the market, where a significant portion of the money to be made from the discrete graphics processor market lies. 
Although one could argue that Intel might be willing to make the incremental investments required to go after this market, the risk-to-reward ratio of trying to go up against NVIDIA and AMD in this segment -- which have established gamer-focused brands (GeForce and Radeon, respectively) and long histories of developing high-performance graphics chips -- seems rather poor. 
Intel's strategy seems a better way to create shareholder valueIntel's current strategy with integrated graphics is an interesting one. For a given class of product, Intel tends to offer two levels of graphics performance.
There's the baseline level of graphics present in most of its chips which come with reasonable levels of 3D performance as well as the company's latest multimedia features. In a modern PC, integrated graphics is a must, so Intel seems to try to make even this ""baseline"" level of graphics fairly competitive. 
Where things get really interesting, though, is what it's doing with its higher-end variants. Intel seems to be trying to -- in some cases significantly -- increase the performance of its higher-end Iris/Iris Pro integrated graphics engines with each generation.
Intel's apparent goal is to try to displace low-end/mid-range discrete graphics chips, particularly in mobile form factors, by trying to offer similar performance as those parts and capturing the value that would have otherwise gone to the discrete graphics chip vendor. 
Ultimately, Intel's goal here is to try to improve the average selling prices of its chips, which is probably the most sensible way for Intel to try to capitalize on more powerful graphics solutions.

            ","According to a leak from BenchLife.info, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will be launching accelerated processing units -- which integrate both the CPU and the graphics core onto a single piece of silicon -- based on its next-generation ""Zen"" processor architecture during the first half of 2017.
There seems to be a lot of speculation out there as to whether AMD will incorporate the High Bandwidth Memory technology (commonly referred to as HBM) used in its recently released ""Fiji"" graphics chip into these Zen-based APUs.
I believe that the answer is probably ""no"" -- here's why.
Zen APUs are aimed at ""mainstream"" price points, and HBM isn't cheap According to a leaked AMD slide, the company is positioning its first Zen-based APUs, code-named ""Raven Ridge,"" as a ""mainstream"" processor in 2017. Given that HBM seems to be positioned as a premium memory type aimed at very high-performance processors (such as high-end graphics chips), it doesn't seem likely that including significant amounts of HBM on an APU would be particularly cost effective.
Even the higher-end Summit Ridge chips likely won't have it Interestingly enough, according to additional leaked slides from BenchLife, AMD's higher-end (and thus more expensive) desktop chip -- code-named ""Summit Ridge"" -- which the slide indicates is aimed at the ""performance segment"" for ""highly threaded applications,"" probably won't have this technology.
In fact, according to a prior leak (via KitGuru),  Summit Ridge will feature only dual-channel DDR4 memory. One might suggest that AMD might not need a ton of memory channels, because it will bring HBM onto the package, but the following slide from the company's Financial Analyst Day seems to suggest otherwise:

Source: AMD. 
Indeed, notice that AMD explicitly called out the use of HBM for its ""high-performance GPUs"" but only talked about DDR4 compatibility for its next-generation FX chips.
I would suspect that if AMD were planning to introduce a major new memory technology that could potentially be a competitive advantage, it would have highlighted it at its Financial Analyst Day.
It's pretty clear, then, that client processors from AMD using HBM probably won't hit the market until at least 2018, if not well beyond then.
Where might we see AMD deploy HBM, then? AMD is obviously deploying HBM on to its highest-end Fiji graphics chip today, and I would expect that over time -- as HBM becomes more cost effective -- AMD to try to bring HBM to stand-alone graphics chips sold at lower price points.
I could also see AMD deploying HBM in other graphics-intensive applications, such as a next-generation game console chip. Such a chip is likely to have significant CPU computing power as well as relatively beefy graphics capabilities (especially since a major console refresh may be several years out), so HBM could be a good fit there.
Finally, AMD talked at its recent Financial Analyst Day about bringing ""disruptive memory bandwidth"" to its next-generation Opteron server processors. Although I am inclined to think that this may just mean the inclusion of more DDR4 memory channels with support for higher-frequency memory, this might also be a clue that AMD plans to integrate HBM into such processors.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently announced the pricing and release date for its small form-factor Radeon R9 Fury Nano graphics card. The R9 Fury Nano is a fully enabled version of AMD's new ""Fiji"" graphics processor targeted at high-end gamers who also want something efficient and compact. It is expected to launch on September 10.
Unfortunately, just like the Radeon R9 Fury and its higher-end sibling, the Fury X, it seems that these cards will once again be in short supply at launch.
Evidence of a potential shortage Scott Wasson of the Tech Report, a well-known PC hardware review site, put up a post on the site asking for somebody to help him get ahold of a Radeon R9 Fury Nano for review. Why? Because AMD is apparently ""chosen not to provide [The Tech Report] with a product sample for review.""
Interestingly enough, this reminds me of when technology website KitGuru was denied a review sample of the recently launched Radeon R9 Fury X. According to KitGuru, AMD told the site that ""with limited product, [AMD] wanted to focus on giving review samples to publications that are 'more positive' about AMD as a brand, and company.""
I suspect that with AMD doing the same thing to The Tech Report, potentially due to the fact that Scott Wasson advised his readers to wait for third-party reviews rather than take AMD's (quite optimistic) marketing slides at face value before buying the card.
What could be driving this supply shortage?  It's not clear exactly just how supply limited AMD is, but if the supply situation with the Radeon R9 Fury X is any indication (and it should since the Radeon R9 Nano uses the same exact, fully enabled chip), I suspect that the answer to that is ""very.""
It's not completely clear what's driving this supply shortage, but if I had to guess, I would blame it mostly on AMD's adoption of High Bandwidth Memory, or HBM.
This new memory type is quite interesting for high-end graphics cards (both AMD and its chief competitor plan to use it in future graphics architectures) -- it offers significant performance-per-watt and board footprint improvements over traditional GDDR5 --  but it's quite new, which might mean that manufacturing it, at least at this stage of the game, is difficult.
The Radeon R9 Fury/Fury X silicon die itself is also quite large, which might make getting fully functional dies -- even on a mature 28-nanometer process -- difficult. So, the combination of both a brand-new memory type as well as a very large, complex graphics chip could be what is tripping AMD up.
What might this mean for AMD? With the Radeon R9 Fury/Fury X and Nano, AMD is trying to regain market segment share in the high end of the stand-alone graphics processor market.
That said, I think AMD will have a difficult time here. Firstly, AMD's evident supply limitations mean that it won't be able to satisfy the demand for its high-end graphics. Although there may be a fair number of gamers who will wait for AMD's cards to come back into stock, I suspect that NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti will meet the needs of buyers looking for Radeon R9 Fury X performance.
As far as the Radeon R9 Nano goes, AMD seems to be targeting a fairly small niche in offering a high-end graphics chip in a very small form factor. For users who absolutely need to have very high performance in a super-small card, AMD will probably have the edge over NVIDIA's offerings.
That said, if AMD can't fix its supply issues soon, it might not even be able to satisfy the demand within that relatively small niche, potentially meaning that AMD won't capture as much revenue as it otherwise could have.

            ","For many years now, high-end stand-alone graphics processors have used a type of memory known as GDDR5. However, to drive a substantial increase in memory bandwidth to feed increasingly powerful graphics processors, graphics chipmakers are looking to transition to a new memory standard known as high-bandwidth memory, or HBM for short.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently launched its first graphics processor family using the first version of HBM. The use of HBM has allowed AMD to gain a solid memory bandwidth advantage over the highest-end graphics chips from rival graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), but with a major caveat: The first version of HBM was limited to just 4 gigabytes of memory.
The next version of HBM, known as HBM2, is expected to enable significantly larger capacities as well as greater speeds. Both Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA are expected to adopt this technology in their next-generation graphics architectures, slated to launch in 2016.
Interestingly enough, though, there was a report out of website WCCFTech not too long ago claiming that AMD would have ""priority access"" to the HBM2 supply out of memory maker SK Hynix. The implication here would be that AMD would be able to get the jump on NVIDIA in releasing next-generation graphics cards.
Is there any truth to this report? Let's take a closer look.
First things first: reaching out to AMD and NVIDIA The first thing I did was to reach out to both AMD and NVIDIA for comment on this story. AMD's Drew Praire responded, ""We haven't said this and I wouldn't expect we would talk about our supplier arrangement on future products publicly.""
NVIDIA's Ken Brown offered this: ""We can't comment on rumors or speculation.""
Well, I had to ask!
Let's see what SK Hynix has to say At MemCon, a well-known memory industry event, SK Hynix -- which WCCFTech claims is giving AMD ""priority access"" to HBM -- gave a presentation on HBM. In the presentation, Hynix boasted that it would begin volume production on HBM1 in early 2015 and that ""design wins"" were in progress ""with major SoCs in multiple markets.""
In the presentation, SK Hynix further went on to explain the virtues of HBM as a next-generation memory technology for high-performance processors such as GPUs, citing lower power consumption, a smaller physical footprint, and lower latency compared to current DDR solutions.
Nothing conclusive, but here's why I doubt WCCFTech's report From SK Hynix's presentation, it would seem that the memory maker is eager to sell HBM2 to as many customers as possible. I doubt that SK Hynix's other customers -- many of which are probably larger than AMD -- would be all too thrilled to know that they will have to wait in line behind AMD, especially with memory giant Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) having said that it will go into production on HBM2 in the first half of 2016.
If SK Hynix tells potential customers to take a hike because AMD has dibs on HBM2, then I suspect they will take their business on over to Samsung. Unless AMD is writing huge checks to secure ""priority access"" (which, given AMD's relatively fragile balance sheet position, seems unlikely), I doubt that AMD will have the ""priority access"" that WCCFTech claims it has.

In 2013, graphics-chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a technology called G-SYNC, a hardware solution that allows monitors to adapt their frame rates to the GPU, solving the problem of visual screen-tearing when the GPU and monitor are out of sync. G-SYNC monitors require a proprietary module from NVIDIA to function, adding a premium to the price, but reviews of the technology have been positive.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) took a different approach, developing FreeSync, a royalty-free alternative that is an optional component of the DisplayPort 1.2a specification and requires no proprietary hardware. NVIDIA was first to market with G-SYNC monitors, but FreeSync monitors are now available, and both technologies provide an effective solution.
NVIDIA has an inherent advantage over AMD; during the second quarter, NVIDIA shipped a whopping 82% of all discrete graphics cards, according to Jon Peddie Research, leaving AMD with a paltry 18% market share. Since G-SYNC functionality works only with NVIDIA's graphics cards, and NVIDIA doesn't support the FreeSync standard, the majority of graphics-card owners don't have FreeSync as a viable option.
The wildcard in all of this is Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). While NVIDIA dominates the discrete graphics-card market, if processors with integrated graphics are included, Intel accounts for 75% of all graphics-chip shipments. Earlier this month, Intel announced that its future graphics chips would support the FreeSync standard. The timeline on when this would happen wasn't specified, but it's a big win for FreeSync nonetheless.
With both Intel and AMD getting behind FreeSync, NVIDIA's proprietary G-SYNC technology may be a lost cause.
A loss for NVIDIA, but not a win for AMD G-SYNC was an attempt by NVIDIA to lock in its customers, creating a major incentive to stick with its graphics cards when it came time to upgrade. With NVIDIA already having a massive market share, if G-SYNC were to become the standard, AMD would have been at an even greater disadvantage.
NVIDIA has been attempting build an ecosystem around its graphics cards, and G-SYNC is just one component. NVIDIA's GeForce Experience software provides owners of the company's graphics cards a bevy of features, such as automatic optimization for different games, built-in game streaming to Twitch, and the ability to stream games to NVIDIA's SHIELD devices. The ultimate goal is to sell more graphics cards, and software is an area where NVIDIA has pulled out ahead of AMD.
G-SYNC certainly isn't dead yet, but a scenario where both G-SYNC and FreeSync are widely used now that Intel has backed FreeSync is difficult to imagine. One possibility is that NVIDIA pushes G-SYNC as a premium option while also supporting FreeSync, hoping to get buyers of its high-end graphics cards to buy G-SYNC monitors. This would require G-SYNC to be noticeably superior to FreeSync, and while there are some differences in performance between the two technologies, it's not clear whether that justifies the price premium.
If FreeSync becomes the standard, and NVIDIA abandons G-SYNC and adopts FreeSync, it will certainly be a loss for NVIDIA. But it's not really a win for AMD. AMD doesn't gain an advantage if FreeSync ultimately wins out; it simply avoids being put in an even worse competitive position. In other words, it doesn't help AMD sell more graphics cards.
The silver lining for NVIDIA is that it's unclear exactly when Intel's graphics chips will support FreeSync, and with its dominant discrete graphics market share, G-SYNC could still be viable for quite some time. But I think the odds that G-SYNC will ultimately win out against FreeSync are slim.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has played second fiddle to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the discrete graphics card market for years. Up until about a year ago, AMD was still putting up respectable numbers; during the second quarter of 2014, the company shipped about 40% of all discrete graphics cards.
Since then, AMD has been bleeding market share. In September of last year, NVIDIA launched some disruptive products, the GTX 970 and GTX 980, beginning a trend of market share losses for AMD that has yet to let up. During the first quarter of 2015, AMD's share of the discrete graphics card market had declined to just 22.5%, according to Jon Peddie Research.
New graphics cards from AMD launched in June, both a series of rebrands as well as brand new high-end products. But according to numbers from Mercury Research, NVIDIA won even more market share from AMD during the second quarter. AMD's market share has now fallen to just 18%.

Source: Jon Peddie Research and Mercury Research.
With AMD's discrete graphics card market share cut in half over the past year, and with those share losses accelerating during the second quarter amid an extremely weak PC market, the situation is looking dire for AMD.
Why aren't people buying AMD's graphics cards? Since the launch of the GTX 980 in September of last year, AMD hasn't really had a competitor at the high end of the market. The Radeon Fury and Fury X, which launched at the end of June, corrected this issue, but with availability issues plaguing the high-end cards, NVIDIA still effectively owns the high end. Nearly two months after launch, the Fury X is still completely sold out on Newegg.com. And even if it was available, the GTX 980 Ti, which NVIDIA launched in early June, offers generally better performance for the same price.
Most of the volume happens at lower price points, and AMD has a much stronger lineup in the value segment of the graphics card market. Tom's Hardware routinely publishes a list of the best graphics cards at different price points based on performance-per-dollar, and AMD's GPUs were deemed the best buy at the $100, $115, $150, and $200 price points in the latest update.
Why, then, has NVIDIA been winning so much market share? Part of the problem is that all of AMD's lower-end graphics cards are based on old GPUs. The entire Radeon 300 series are rebrands of the Radeon 200 series with slightly tweaked performance, and some of the Radeon 200 series cards are themselves rebrands of even older cards.
Meanwhile, NVIDIA has been filling in its low-end and mid-range lineup with brand-new cards based on its Maxwell architecture. The GTX 960 was launched in January for $199 and the GTX 950 in August for $159. Raw performance isn't the only thing that matters; power consumption, features, and software are also important.
The core problem at AMD is that the company doesn't have the resources to keep up with NVIDIA. AMD's PC business is suffering huge losses, and research and development spending has been slashed over the past few years. NVIDIA has been able to launch brand-new graphics cards; add features like Dynamic Super Resolution, which allows for improved image quality; and develop software like GameWorks, which allows developers to easily add advanced graphics features to their games -- features that are optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. AMD is being out-innovated, plain and simple.
With AMD's high-end cards still in short supply more than halfway through the third quarter, it's hard to imagine the company winning back much market share in the near term. AMD is in a very tough spot, and barring a massive misstep by NVIDIA, I don't see things getting much better for the company anytime soon.

            ","Over the last several quarters, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has gained substantial market segment share in the stand-alone graphics processor market. In fact, according to research firm Mercury Research, NVIDIA's share of the market for stand-alone desktop graphics chips was a cool 82% in the second quarter, representing both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases. 
This share gain has come at the expense of NVIDIA's only competitor in this market, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which captured just 18% of the market for stand-alone desktop graphics chips in the second quarter. 
At this point, a question worth exploring is: ""Will NVIDIA continue to gain stand-alone graphics chip share at AMD's expense?"" 
Background: NVIDIA's Maxwell architecture has been a ""game changer"" NVIDIA's significantly strengthened its desktop-oriented graphics processor offerings in the third quarter of last year with the launch of its GeForce GTX 970/980 graphics chips based on the company's Maxwell architecture. Both of these cards offered best-in-class performance and power consumption at launch.
Since then, NVIDIA has expanded its product portfolio with additional Maxwell-based chips. At higher price points than the $500 GeForce GTX 980, NVIDIA now sells the GeForce GTX 980 Ti (starting at $650) as well as the GeForce GTX Titan X (starting at $1,000).
At lower price points, NVIDIA has gone after the $199 to roughly $240 price points with the GTX 960, and even recently brought Maxwell to the $160 to $170 price points with the GTX 950.
According to Mercury Research, NVIDIA's stand-alone desktop-oriented GPU share was 62% in the second quarter of 2014 and moved dramatically upward beginning in the third quarter. It's likely not a coincidence that NVIDIA began seeing a sizable uptick in market segment share following the Maxwell launch.

Source: Mercury Research via WCCFTech. 
AMD has finally responded, but will the market care? A reason that some will cite for AMD's dramatic market segment share erosion is the fact that AMD's response to Maxwell at the high end didn't show up until June of this year with the launch of AMD's Fury/Fury X graphics cards.
Third-party reviews of the $650 Fury X show that it is slightly slower than the $650 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti. According to a review from TechPowerUp, the $549 R9 Fury offers about 7.5% better performance than the $499 vanilla GeForce GTX 980 at 2560-by-1440 resolution.
The problem for the Fury, though, is that factory-overclocked GTX 980s such as the ASUS Strix GeForce GTX 980 -- which can be had for around $510 before rebate ($480 after rebate) on both Newegg.com and Amazon.com -- could significantly narrow the performance gap between the Fury and ""standard"" GTX 980s while still coming in cheaper.
The rest of AMD's lineup -- the Radeon 300-series cards -- appear to be slightly faster variants (with more memory in some cases) of the same fundamental chip designs used in the corresponding Radeon 200-series cards.
At any rate, I believe that a good indicator of what the market share dynamics will look like for the next several quarters will be that of both graphics chip vendors during the third quarter. 
AMD's new graphics offerings will have been in the market since the beginning of the third quarter, suggesting that if these new products are going to have an impact, it will become evident then.
If things start turning around for AMD with respect to stand-alone graphics chip share in the third quarter, then that could be a reasonable indicator that its graphics chip lineup may just be strong enough to catalyze several quarters of share gain.
However, if despite new products AMD's share remains flat or even continues to decline in the third quarter, I would expect continued pain for AMD's stand-alone graphics chip business through at least this product cycle.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have been cut in half over the past 12 months due to its inability to compete against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in x86 chips and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in high-end graphics cards. Last quarter, AMD's revenue plunged 35% annually to $942 million as it posted a net loss of $181 million -- down from a loss of $36 million a year earlier.

Source: AMD.
Considering how poorly AMD has performed over the past year, it would seem inappropriate to pay big bonuses to its top executives. But based on recent SEC filings, AMD paid out big equity awards to senior executives, including CEO Lisa Su, CTO Mark Papermaster, and CFO Devinder Kumar, throughout August. Those awards were a mix of performance-based restricted stock, time-based restricted stock, and options. 
The total value of those packages was comparable to equity awards from last year. Bernstein analyst Stacy A. Rasgon called the awards ""extremely distasteful"" considering how badly AMD had fared over the past year. Let's take a closer look at how much AMD pays its top executives, and whether investors should be concerned.
Soaring bonuses, slumping stockAMD paid out $32.98 million in executive compensation in fiscal 2014 -- a 47% increase from $22.46 million in 2013. Last year, Lisa Su claimed $11.8 million of that total, which includes her annual salary of $850,000. Former CEO Rory Read was paid $7.7 million, with a large portion attributed to a $5 million severance payment.
In comparison, Intel paid $41.67 million in executive compensation last year, a 17% decline from the prior year. CEO Brian Krzanich's compensation package of $11.2 million was also notably smaller than Lisa Su's. Nvidia's executive compensation rose 38% annually to $22.9 million last year, with CEO Jen-Hsun Huang receiving $9.3 million. Those packages more or less matched Intel and Nvidia's performance over the past year. Intel struggled with a slowdown in the PC market, while mobile subsidies weighed down its bottom line. Nvidia, on the other hand, dodged that slowdown with robust sales of high-end graphics cards for gamers.
Compensation packages don't always reflect a company's performance, but the fact that AMD boosted executive bonuses nearly 50% as its stock shed half its value should worry investors.
Benefit of the doubtHowever, investors could also give AMD the benefit of the doubt. Part of those equity awards might be retention bonuses. But as Rasgon notes in his report, both Kumar and Papermaster already received retention bonuses in January. Lisa Su and GM of the EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, Semi-Custom) Forrest Norrod took over their current positions less than a year ago, making them ineligible for retention bonuses.
AMD's management might be increasing their exposure to show investors that their earnings also depend on the company's stock price. But with the stock down more than 70% over the past five years, it seems doubtful that any symbolic moves will boost investor confidence.
On the bright side, AMD's stock bonuses don't weigh too heavily on its bottom line. Last quarter, AMD's total stock-based compensation declined 19% annually to $17 million, or less than 2% of its total revenues. By comparison, Intel paid out 2.5% of its revenue last quarter as stock bonuses, while Nvidia paid 4%. 
A sinking shipWhether or not AMD ""overpays"" its executives could be a moot point if the stock keeps sliding. The company's Computing and Graphics division remains sandwiched between Intel and Nvidia, and the unit's operating loss nearly doubled from $75 million to $147 million between the second quarters of 2014 and 2015. The EESC unit, which was previously propped up by sales of console APUs, also reported top and bottom line declines due to ""seasonally lower sales"".
AMD hopes that chips for AR/VR devices and high-performance mobile APUs can help it expand into niche markets and avoid Intel and Nvidia. But if those niche markets ever become mainstream, Intel and Nvidia will likely launch comparable products and marginalize AMD once again. 
If AMD's executives can get their act together and widen the company's defensive moat against that threat, they might deserve those big bonuses. But for now, they simply seem more interested in enriching themselves instead of long-suffering shareholders.

            ","Graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) surprised just about everyone when it reported its second-quarter earnings last week. The company had previously guided for an 8.4% year-over-year decline in revenue, driven by an extremely weak PC market. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) also launched new graphics cards during NVIDIA's second quarter, bringing competition back to the high end of the market.
Instead of posting a revenue decline, however, NVIDIA managed to grow revenue by 5% year over year during the second quarter. NVIDIA's gaming GPU business held up far better than even the company expected, with gaming revenue rising 59% year over year, driven by high-end products like the GTX 980 Ti.
Sales to PC OEMs fell dramatically, as expected given the weak PC market, but NVIDIA is far less dependent on OEMs today compared to even a few years ago. I argued a few weeks ago that NVIDIA would be able to weather a weak PC market far better than other PC-dependent companies, and its second-quarter results seem to bear that out.
Bad news for AMD NVIDIA's results also tell us something about AMD's newest graphics cards. AMD launched its Radeon 300 series of cards on June 18, essentially a refresh of its previous Radeon 200 series. The company also launched its high-end Fury X graphics card on June 24, providing a competitor to NVIDIA's GTX 980 Ti. With NVIDIA's second quarter ending on July 26, the last third of the quarter was subject to this influx of new competition.
I see no sign that AMD's launch had any negative effect on NVIDIA's results. In fact, the latter's gaming revenue actually accelerated during the second quarter compared to the first, when gaming revenue grew by just 25% year over year. It seems that AMD's new cards, at least in their first month, have failed to disrupt the status quo. That's a problem, because AMD's PC business is currently suffering massive losses.
There are a couple of factors worth mentioning. First, the entire Radeon 300 series is just a refresh based on previous GPUs, with modest improvements in performance. These cards range in price from $109 to $429, compared to a $649 price tag for the high-end Fury X, so this is where most of the volume of AMD's GPU business takes place. While NVIDIA has launched brand new mid-range graphics cards in the recent past, like the GTX 960 in January, AMD's lack of anything fundamentally new at these prices could be having a negative effect on sales.
Second, actually buying the Fury X is easier said than done. More than one month after launch, Newegg.com is still completely out of stock of the Fury X. The Fury X uses a completely new GPU, Fiji, and it's the first graphics card to use High Bandwidth Memory, so it's not all that surprising that AMD is reportedly having some serious problems supplying enough chips to meet demand. The GTX 980 Ti actually performs slightly better than the Fury X for the same price, according to Anandtech, so frustrated gamers may be turning to NVIDIA.
Assuming that AMD gets its supply problems fixed, the company may have better luck in the second half of the year. But as it stands, NVIDIA doesn't appear to be feeling any heat at all from AMD's latest product launch. In fact, the shortage of the Fury X may actually be driving gamers to the GTX 980 Ti, potentially giving a boost to NVIDIA's results.
NVIDIA's strong second-quarter results demonstrate that the gaming PC market is largely detached from the PC market as a whole, and NVIDIA's dominant share of the discrete GPU market has allowed it to perform well despite tumbling PC sales. For AMD, it's been an entirely different story.

            ","Over at Seeking Alpha, contributor Chis Lau argues that struggling chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a ""buy."" His thesis is centered on the following three arguments:
With respect to Lau, I don't find these arguments terribly convincing. Here's why. 
Yes, AMD's results were quite bad Lau argues that AMD's second-quarter revenue of $942 million (a steep 34.6% drop from the same period last year) and non-GAAP loss of $0.17 per share (versus a $0.05-per-share non-GAAP profit in the year ago period) weren't ""that bad."" 
Given AMD's relatively precarious financial situation, a sharp year-over-year decline in sales and swinging from a modest non-GAAP profit to a relatively wide non-GAAP loss are ""bad"" in my book. 
Lau also says AMD didn't ""miss expectations by much."" That's technically true, but it's meaningless in light of AMD's downward revision on its second-quarter outlook a little over a week before the full earnings release. 
Did AMD sandbag results? In addition to AMD's less-than-stellar results in its second quarter, the company forecasts ""just"" a 6% increase in sales for the third quarter, which at the time of issuance yet again missed the analyst consensus. Lau argues that AMD is ""sandbagging"" this revenue number and that system vendors will build ""inventory for AMD chips to address strong hardware demand stemming from the Windows 10 upgrade,"" noting that ""AMD's revenue from this segment should increase.""
However, I see no evidence that AMD is sandbagging its guidance here. In fact, on the earnings call, CEO Lisa Su said the company expects its shipments of laptop-oriented processors to ""rebound and ramp in the second half of the year as more than 35 Carrizo [AMD's next-generation chip] platforms come to market globally.""
It looks as though AMD's outlook already assumes that shipments of laptop chip sales will pick up in the second half of the year. If anything, AMD's track record of having to guide-down (which it did just last quarter) suggests that the company has a habit of overestimating demand for its microprocessors.
Fury X GPU an ""unexpected success""? Hardly. Lastly, Lau argues that AMD's Fury line of GPUs ""is a second reason investors should buy AMD."" He says these GPUs are ""earning high scores"" in third-party reviews and even states that demand for the R9 Fury X ""was so strong, with supply so limited, that the card was reportedly out of stock.""
There is little argument that AMD's Fury line of graphics processors is in short supply, but this doesn't necessarily indicate abnormally strong demand. In fact, there have been rumblings that AMD's supply of its Fury and Fury X GPUs is so tight that not all of AMD's traditional add-in board partners were able to launch Fury-based cards.
In other words, it seems that AMD, for whatever reason, is facing a significant supply shortage. 
To make matters worse, AMD's chief competitor, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), appears to be having little issue getting supply of its GeForce GTX 980 and 980 Ti graphics processors to its add-in board partners. Further, given that various review sites show that the 980 Ti is the same price as the Radeon R9 Fury X but is more power-efficient and faster, being supply limited at this point is a clear negative for AMD.
The Radeon Fury is known to be a little bit faster than a standard GTX 980 (and also more expensive, if one can find them in stock), but the market is seemingly filled to the brim with factory-overclocked 980s that should narrow the performance delta between the Fury and the standard 980.
In other words, being ""out of stock"" when your competitor has plenty of very competitive product on the market seems to me more of a negative than a positive.

AMD data by YCharts
What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) plunged 19.6% in July, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. The stock surged 16% higher during the last week of the month, but that wasn't anywhere near enough to erase the memories of a terrible earnings report.
So what: The earnings-related plunge came in several stages. First, AMD shares dropped as much as 8.1% near the end of June, when memory chip company Micron Technology revealed horribly low demand for PC system components. Then, AMD lowered its own sales guidance in the early days of July, also pointing to weak sales from PC system builders. The stock fell another 18%. Finally, the company reported final second-quarter results, reminding investors just how bad the quarter was. Shares fell another 4%, even though most of the bad news had already been unveiled.
Now what: The 16% surge at the end of July came on no news at all, and may have been a simple case of short-sellers taking their profits and going home. The stock bounced off 52-week and all-time lows, some 63% below the stock's 52-week highs.
AMD is looking for a way out of the crumbling PC components market, looking for opportunities to sell its semi-custom processors into new sectors such as consumer electronics and the Internet of Things. Investors and some analysts worry that AMD might not complete its strategy makeover before running out of cash, putting the stock in real danger of becoming completely worthless.
At current prices, AMD presents a classic high-risk, high-reward opportunity. The stock could bounce sky-high with a successful non-PC revamp -- or die trying. Today, it's not at all obvious where AMD's stock will end up.
In July, plenty of investors took the pessimistic view of AMD's prospects. Keep a close eye on PC sales for clues on where the stock is going next, and don't forget to weigh AMD's semi-custom chip sales against the company's remaining cash reserves.

            ","A major part of NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) graphics processor business comes from PC gamers buying new graphics chips in order to play the latest graphics-intensive PC games. Even though the overall PC market has been weak, NVIDIA reported that its sales of graphics processors into gaming-oriented PCs grew by 14% year over year last quarter.
I believe that there may be an imminent catalyst for NVIDIA's gaming-oriented graphics processor business that could fuel further growth during the second half of the year.
Intel's Skylake will be here soon PC processor vendor Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to launch its next-generation PC processor code-named Skylake shortly, with the first wave of chips said to be aimed at the enthusiast desktop segment.
Even if a new processor family might not compel typical PC users to rush out and buy new systems, I believe that a fair number of PC enthusiasts and gamers have been waiting on Skylake before building new systems and/or upgrading existing systems.
If my hypothesis is correct, then not only should Intel see a solid boost in sales aimed at PC gamers and enthusiasts when Skylake launches, but NVIDIA could be poised to benefit as those gamers buy new graphics cards to go with their new Skylake-based systems.
Another potential advantage for NVIDIA: AMD's apparent Fury shortage With Skylake set to begin its roll out in a week or so, NVIDIA may have another factor working in its favor. NVIDIA's main competitor in desktop graphics, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), recently released its Fury and Fury X graphics processors aimed at the high end of the desktop PC gaming market.
Although I believe NVIDIA's products are superior to AMD's based on third-party reviews, there are certainly gamers out there currently using AMD graphics that may be inclined to stick with AMD if possible due to their positive experience with its product.
However, it seems that supply of AMD's Fury and Fury X cards is quite tight. A check of popular online retailer Newegg.com shows that of the few Radeon R9 Fury and Fury X models that the site carries, all are currently out of stock. In contrast, Newegg has many different NVIDIA GTX 980 and GTX 980 Ti models in stock.
Although it seems likely that die-hard AMD users will wait for the cards to come back in stock, my guess is that buyers with no brand preference or even slight bias toward AMD might just throw in the towel and go with the NVIDIA solutions for their new system builds if the availability of AMD's Fury/Fury X cards continues to be tight.
NVIDIA will be reporting soon; keep an eye out NVIDIA recently announced on July 23 that it would be announcing its earnings results on August 6. The company didn't negatively pre-announce, so it should report results roughly in line with its guidance last quarter.
I'll be paying close attention to the guidance that the company issues for the current quarter and will be listening for any commentary from management with respect to a potential acceleration in GPU sales as a result of the Skylake launch. I'll also be listening in for any hints as to how management expects its gaming-oriented market segment share to trend now that competitor AMD has laid all of its cards out (no pun intended) on the table.

            ","At Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) most recent Financial Analyst Day, executives from the company outlined their goal to become a significant player in the server processor market. The company is banking on new processors using AMD's redesigned processor core, code-named ""Zen,"" to try and gain share in the market for x86 server processors.
These share gains, according to a presentation from AMD CEO Lisa Su, are expected to come in the 2017/2018 time frame.
While AMD is telling a good story, I am not convinced the company will have such an easy time gaining share.
AMD's track record is pretty poor Back at AMD's 2010 Financial Analyst Day, the company showed the following server CPU roadmap:

Source: AMD Financial Analyst Day presentation
In 2011, the company did, in fact, launch the ""Interlagos"" and ""Valencia"" CPUs mentioned above, but ""Terramar"" and ""Sepang"" never showed up. Instead, AMD launched ""Abu Dhabi"" and ""Seoul"" in place of ""Terramar"" and ""Sepang,"" respectively, featuring the same core counts as their predecessors, but using the company's follow-on to the ""Bulldozer"" CPU core known as ""Piledriver.""
Since then, though, AMD hasn't released new server processors based on the company's newer CPU cores (Steamroller and Excavator), even though at the company's 2012 Financial Analyst Day, the company suggested that such products were incoming:

Source: Advanced Micro Devices Financial Analyst Day 2012
What the company is promising today Earlier this year, AMD showed the following server product ""roadmap"":

Source: Advanced Micro Devices Financial Analyst Day 2015
According to this, AMD is going to put out high-core count X86 server processors for more ""traditional"" server segments, high-performance ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) based processors aimed at storage, networking, and embedded segments, and will also put out a ""high-performance server APU,"" which will presumably combine AMD's new Zen processor cores with its next generation graphics.
At first glance, it seems like AMD is going to have a whole suite of competitive products that should allow it to capture meaningful market segment share across a large number of data-center applications. But I think AMD may, in this case, be overpromising and, if I'm right, will wind up substantially underdelivering.
What is the basis for these claims? Take a look at the following chart illustrating AMD's research-and-development spend over the last 10 years:

Source: YCharts
The server roadmap that AMD outlined in 2010 was published when AMD's total corporate research-and-development spending was in the neighborhood of $1.4 billion. Looking back, it would appear AMD didn't have the resources to execute upon its prior roadmap.
Where were the Steamroller-based server chips? How about the Excavator-based ones?
A more recent example of AMD's failure to actually launch products in a timely fashion would be its ARM-based microserver part code-named ""Seattle."" This part integrates eight off-the-shelf ARM Cortex A57 cores in a proven 28-nanometer manufacturing process, and AMD says that it won't start seeing revenue from shipping systems until the second half of 2015.
Note that back in 2013, AMD was telling people Seattle would sample in early 2014 and that ""volume shipments"" would begin in the second half of 2014.
If AMD was a year late on what I believe should have been a fairly straightforward microserver processor, should investors really believe that AMD will be able to actually hit its 2016/2017 launch plans with a whole suite of these arguably (much) more complex server processors built on a relatively new manufacturing technology on what is a substantially reduced research-and-development budget?
Keep the optimism in check I think that investors who buy AMD on the expectation the company will execute perfectly on the roadmaps outlined at the 2015 Financial Analyst Day will wind up being disappointed. Whether that disappointment ultimately comes as a result of products that aren't as competitive as implied, or from significant product delays, is hard to tell at this point.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been struggling with market-share losses in its core markets for quite some time. The company recently reported its quarterly earnings, and the results show no discernible signs of any real progress on the company's turnaround. The segment containing CPUs and GPUs declined by more than half year over year, with a weak PC market doing a number of AMD's top and bottom lines.
AMD faces the challenge of competing with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market, both of which are profitable, and both of which have been stealing market share away from AMD in recent quarters and years. How bad is it for AMD? Click through the following slideshow to see three charts that should scare AMD investors.

            ","Writing for Seeking Alpha, Mark Hibben suggests that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might enlist the semi-custom design services of struggling chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), to build a custom-tailored processor for Apple's MacBooks. In fact, he pegs those chances as ""good.""
I, on the other hand, think that this is highly unlikely.
If Apple wants a semi-custom MacBook processor, Intel could do the job, too One key argument that Hibben makes is that Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) PC processor designs are designed in a ""one-size fits all"" fashion to serve the requirements of a wide range of PC customers. By commissioning a semi-custom chip from AMD, Hibben argues, Apple could get exactly what it wants/needs without any of the additional ""bloat"" present to support other PC makers' designs.
The first (but certainly not the biggest) issue here is that Intel, too, offers semi-custom design services for big customers. Intel's semi-custom pitch has been more targeted toward the data center (where major customers are willing to pay to get exactly what they want), but there is no fundamental reason that Intel could not build ""semi-custom"" processors in the PC segment for the right customer.
There is little need for semi-custom MacBook processors Although Hibben argues that Apple might be better served with custom-tailored parts for the MacBook, I disagree. Take a look at the following diagram that Hibben pointed to in his article:

Source: Intel via Seeking Alpha.
Notice on the big green rectangle that there are two black rectangles? The longer one is the main processor complex. This contains the CPU cores, graphics/media engine, and the rest of the performance-critical components.
The smaller black rectangle is the PCH or the ""platform controller hub."" This is an auxiliary input/output chip that that, among other things, allows the processor to talk to other components. Hibben argues that Apple ""isn't using a lot of that stuff,"" and for the new thin-and-light MacBook this is true, but all of this functionality is stuffed into a cheap-to-make auxiliary silicon die and can be disabled if need be.
The idea that Apple should ditch Intel and commission a totally new, semi-custom chip from AMD because it doesn't need to use the USB and Serial ATA functionality present in Intel's Platform Controller Hub seems ludicrous.
Would Apple really trust the Mac to AMD? Another issue here is that AMD's notebook processors haven't been competitive with Intel's for a while, all things considered. It is not a coincidence that AMD has continued to bleed share to Intel in the notebook market for a long time.
In order for AMD to have a chance at winning the MacBook contracts (either via off-the-shelf parts or a semi-custom arrangement, as Hibben suggests), it will need to be able to deliver leadership PC processor products (MacBooks are premium products and Apple is likely to want to use the best chips possible). Given Intel's vastly greater ability to invest in its architectures and designs, as well as its manufacturing leadership, it's hard to see this happening.
It's all very unlikely I would peg the chances of Apple swapping Intel out for AMD in the MacBook as extremely low. Intel's PC processors are, in my view, the ""gold standard"" in the industry and Intel's track record suggests that the company knows how to consistently deliver winning PC products. AMD, on the other hand, has a lot to prove and I doubt that Apple wants to be its guinea pig.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported its second-quarter earnings on July 16, and the numbers were not good. Revenue slumped by more than one-third year over year to $942 million, and the company reported a net loss of $181 million. The PC side of the business was a mess, and even the semi-custom business suffered from declining profitability.
The numbers, though, don't tell the whole story. Here are five quotes from AMD's conference call that provide some additional detail on the state of the business.
Another semi-custom design win Last October, AMD announced that it had secured two new semi-custom SoC design wins. Initial revenue is expected in 2016, and these two deals are expected to generate about $1 billion of revenue over the course of three years. This will diversify AMD's semi-custom business, which currently depends on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game consoles.
During AMD's conference call, CEO Lisa Su announced that the company had secured another new semi-custom design win: ""We also began development of a new Semi-Custom design in the quarter. Like our other Semi-Custom designs, the details are customer confidential, but we are pleased with our progress continuing to expand our customer base in this important part of our business.""
Expanding beyond game consoles is important; game console sales tend to peak a few years after release, followed by a decline leading up to the release of the next generation of consoles. In addition, the average selling price AMD receives for its game console SoCs decline over time, further pressuring revenue.
Catching up to Intel Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been following the tick-tock model, where each microarchitectural change is followed by a die shrink, for the better part of a decade. This ensures that the company isn't simultaneously moving to a new node and making a major microarchitecture change, and it has worked extremely well for Intel over the years.
However, Intel recently announced that it is pushing back its 10nm chips to 2017, inserting a third generation of 14nm chips, thus deviating from the tick-tock model. The company had significant issues with its 14nm process, and as transistors get smaller, die shrinks will inevitable become more challenging. This increase in time between die shrinks could help level the playing field for AMD. According to Su, ""The fact that the gap between foundry technologies and other technologies is shrinking, I think, does change the competitive landscape and will be a good opportunity as we go forward competitively.""
Intel has long had a manufacturing lead over other foundries. While the move to smaller transistors will be challenging for everyone, not just Intel, AMD's ability to use a manufacturing process that's competitive with Intel's, even if only for a year before Intel moves to 10nm, could allow the company to better compete in PCs and servers.
ARM servers are still in the early innings Intel dominates the server chip market, and AMD has seen its market share essentially vanish over the years. The company is working on both x86 server chips as well as ARM server chips, and its first ARM server chip, Seattle, is expected to launch sometime this year. But investors shouldn't expect much. Again from Su: ""Yes, so I think Seattle is a good offering for 64-bit ARM servers, and if you look at what we've said up until now, we have a number of companies both in the ecosystem, as well as users developing software on Seattle and looking at how it operates in the environment. I would say that the overall revenue of Seattle will be modest, as ARM ramps will take a bit of time, but the importance of building the ecosystem is there.""
Seattle will launch at a time when the ARM server market is in its infancy, and it won't contribute much of anything to AMD's top or bottom lines. ARM Holdings expects that ARM servers will account for up to 20% of the market by 2020, an optimistic forecast. Even if ARM is correct, meaningful revenue from ARM server chips for AMD is probably still years away.
About that second-half guidance ... During AMD's analyst day in May, the company provided an optimistic outlook for the second quarter, calling for a return to non-GAAP profitability. I argued recently that this guidance was completely unrealistic, given the state of the PC market, and that the company would most likely be forced to abandon its rosy outlook. During the conference call, it did just that. Because of ""the recent change in the PC market outlook,"" said CFO Devinder Kumar, ""our goal of second-half profitability has been pushed out.""
It's difficult to predict demand in the PC market, but AMD's guidance for the second half lasted all of two months before it had to be abandoned. It's difficult to be confident in any sort of turnaround when AMD has been so off base with its guidance.
AMD is banking on a strong fourth quarter AMD expects revenue to grow sequentially during the third quarter, driven by sales of semi-custom chips for game consoles, as well as improved APU and GPU sales. The company is also expecting a strong fourth quarter. ""Q4, we're not providing guidance, but as you get to the Q4 timeframe, we think the PC market continues to stabilize, and that helps us from that standpoint,"" Kumar says. ""And that's the way we have it baked in.""
AMD is expecting the PC market to stabilize in the second half of the year, and its outlook is built on that assumption. An analyst on the conference call, Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein, called the company out on its optimism:
Right. I guess -- I mean, you're telling me you feel good about Q4, but I mean, let's be honest. You haven't been able to forecast a month and a half out, let alone two quarters. It just seems to me like there's a setup here for more bad things to happen if that market doesn't stabilize. And even if it does stabilize, I mean, your business has been -- let's be honest; it hasn't been stable, versus where the market's been, either.
AMD has been unable to provide accurate guidance for the current quarter, let alone two quarters in advance, so the company's outlook for the PC market should be taken with a grain of salt. If the PC market doesn't stabilize in the second half, then AMD's numbers are going to be downright awful.
Most of AMD's initiatives -- semi-custom design wins, its new Zen processor core, ARM servers -- won't pay off until next year at the earliest. Unfortunately for AMD investors, things could get worse before they have a chance of getting better, regardless of management's optimistic tone.

            ","Though some industry pundits were excited that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was able to meet revenue and earnings expectations in its recently announced Q2, others were quick to point out the decline compared to the year-ago quarter thanks to a weak PC market. Based on its anemic stock price movement since announcing earnings on July 15, investors appear to be uncertain of how to react to Intel's second quarter as well. And therein lies the opportunity.
As noted in a recent article, the Street's continued focus on the impact of the declining PC market is akin to looking in the rearview mirror as it relates to Intel. CEO Brian Krzanich made it clear when he took the reins from former chief Paul Otellini in May of 2013 that Intel was going to transition to new, cutting-edge markets including cloud computing, mobile, and the Internet of Things. Over the long haul, success in these high-growth markets will determine Intel's future, and Q2 saw yet another step -- albeit a smaller one than hoped for -- in the right direction.
Same story, different quarterAs with its much smaller brethren AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), the week leading up to Intel's earnings announcement was rife with negativity. Some of that angst was brought on by Gartner releasing its second-quarter PC sales results that turned out to be even worse than expected. The 9.5% drop in PC shipments was the largest decline in nearly two years.
Thankfully, Intel didn't miss already lowered expectations as AMD did, thanks in part to its focus on expanding its revenue sources beyond PCs. AMD is also trying to move beyond its reliance on PCs by growing its graphics sales, but as its 35% drop in year-over-year revenue demonstrates, it has a long, hard road ahead. Intel's sales declined in Q2 as well, to $13.2 billion from last year's $13.8 billion, but that was a tolerable 5% drop due to its revenue diversification efforts.
Intel naysayers may also note that its earnings of $0.55 a share, which matched last year's results, were as much about its significantly lowered tax rate -- a mere 9.3% compared to 2014's 28.7% -- as it was about revenues. It is certainly a valid point, but there's more to the Intel story.
Solid where it countsPerhaps the area with the most potential for Krzanich's ""new"" Intel lies in its cloud-based data center group. According to some recent data, 42% of IT leaders are planning to increase spending on cloud-related technologies this year, driving total sales to well over $100 billion, a conservative estimate that is expected to nearly double in just three years.
As more private and public consumers shift their data storage and analysis to the cloud, the need for larger, more powerful data centers will continue to grow, and that's where Intel shines. Last quarter's $3.9 billion in sales was a 10% jump over 2014's data center revenues and up 5% sequentially. Intel's IoT division also grew, but not as robustly as some may have expected.
At $559 million in sales, Q2's IoT results were a 4% improvement over 2014 and a 5% increase from 2015's first quarter. But before the Intel bears get too excited, it's worth noting that the IoT market is in an even earlier stage than the cloud. And like the cloud, the IoT market as a whole is expected to explode over the next four to five years, and Intel is at the forefront of this huge opportunity.
Perhaps most telling was the combined makeup of Intel's $13.2 billion in sales last quarter. One of the highlights of its first quarter was the fact that 33% of Intel's revenues were derived from the combined results of its data center and IoT groups. This quarter? That percentage rose to 34% and year over year is even more impressive.
Data center group revenues alone accounted for just shy of 30% of revenues last quarter, up from just 23% two years ago and 26% last year. In other words, Krazanich and team are executing in the areas that matter. And thanks to a strong balance sheet -- Intel is sitting on about $7 billion in ready cash, equivalents, and short-term investments compared to last year's $5 billion -- its 3.26% dividend yield isn't in any danger of declining anytime soon. That should be music to the ears of growth and income investors.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares have been in freefall lately.

AMD's second-quarter results are in, and they provided its share price a brief respite from the never-ending slide. AMD stock gained more than 2.5% in after-hours trading as investors absorbed the report. But on Friday, that brief gain was erased in short order. The stock closed another 4% lower that day.
As presaged in the guidance update, AMD's sales decreased 8% quarter over quarter and 35% year over year. At $942 million, it's AMD's lowest quarterly sales since 2004.
This is what AMD is all about right now. Image source: AMD.
The company saw strong demand for enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom chip products, and revenue rose 13% in that division. It wasn't enough to overcome a 29% sequential sales drop in the computing and graphics segment, driven by very weak orders from PC system builders. In particular, notebook processors were in low demand.
On the bottom line, AMD saw an adjusted net loss of $0.17 per share. That's nearly twice the red ink seen in the first quarter, and down from a $0.05 profit per share in the year-ago period.
Analysts were quick to adjust their revenue targets in line with AMD's new guidance. The company didn't offer updated earnings guidance two weeks ago, but did deliver on its promise of an adjusted gross margin near 28%. That was enough to let analysts nail the adjusted earnings figure, too. So the final report was completely in line with Wall Street's expectations -- albeit very recently adjusted ones, based on fresh preliminary data.
AMD's inventory increased by 16% during the quarter, partly due to preparing the channel for upcoming holiday season builds, and partly caused by the slow PC components flow. A year ago, inventory rose 10% in the second quarter.
The embedded and semi-custom division accounted for 60% of AMD's sales in the second quarter, up from 46% in the previous quarter, and 42% in the year-ago period. AMD is a company in transition, swearing off the traditional PC market and embracing new opportunities in the embedded market.
This is similar to the way Micron Technology is shifting its memory chip production over from desktop and notebook products and deeper into mobile and embedded chips. Intel is taking a somewhat different path, emphasizing server products more than mobility. But all of these current and former PC giants are looking for new markets right now.

Can AMD pull this off? The company sold off all of its short-term investment papers during the second quarter, and burned through 8.4% of its total cash equivalents. It ain't easy being AMD right now, and CEO Lisa Su must turn this cash-leaking ship around in short order. If it continues at this rate for a couple more years, AMD will have to find new funding for its day-to-day operations.
The quicker Su can abandon the increasingly hopeless PC market and double down on mobile products plus the booming Internet of Things market, the better. It's already happening, as the sales mix between AMD's two divisions shows. Just, you know, not quite fast enough.
AMD's results were solid enough to slow the share price free fall, but hardly impressive in their own right. The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since that fateful guidance update, and a heart-stopping 53% over the last year. Several analyst houses have ""buy"" ratings on AMD stock with price targets as generous as $5 per share. I wish Lisa Su and her team the best of luck in getting there, but it's a risky and uncertain road with more dangers than opportunities ahead.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently announced a few graphics cards based on its new Fiji graphics processor design. These Fiji-based designs allow AMD to compete at the $549 and $649 price-points that rival graphics processor vendor, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), has dominated for quite some time.
That said, according to website Hardware Luxx , which claims to have spoken to AMD's add-in board partners, AMD is having difficulties supplying enough of its Fiji graphics chips in order to satiate demand. In fact, supplies are reportedly so right that a number of AMD's add-in board partners are apparently unable to launch their own Fiji-based graphics cards.
Although some view such shortages as a good thing (i.e., demand outstripping supply), such a shortage actually seems to be quite negative for AMD. Let me explain.
Fiji tomorrow, or Maxwell today? The first issue here is that the Radeon R9 Fury and the higher-end Radeon R9 Fury X aren't by any means ""clean kills"" in terms of performance, power consumption, or even outright value relative to the NVIDIA competition.
The R9 Fury X, AMD's cream-of-the-crop, is generally believed to be slightly slower than NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 980 Ti offered at the same price point. The $549 Fury, according to TechPowerUp, delivers more performance than the $499 GeForce GTX 980, but loses in terms of performance-per-watt and performance-per-dollar at high-end resolutions (2560-by-1440 and 3840-by-2160).
In addition to a value proposition that isn't so clear, the cards are also reportedly very difficult to find.
Indeed, when I went to Newegg.com (one of the most popular online retailers for computer gear) in search of a Radeon R9 Fury X, I saw the following:

AMD's new GPU is really hard to buy. Source: Newegg.com
To the gamer who wants to buy a Radeon R9 Fury or R9 Fury X today, I say ""good luck.""
In contrast, I seem to have no issue finding all sort of GeForce GTX 980 cards.  There are also plenty of such cards that are designed to run at faster speeds than what NVIDIA runs them at out of the factory, which probably helps close the performance gap between the stock GTX 980 and the R9 Fury.
The same applies to the GeForce GTX 980 Ti; there seem to be plenty of these cards in stock from a variety of vendors. There even seem to be a number of models that run at speeds higher than what NVIDIA specifies them at, which should help widen the performance gap between NVIDIA's best and AMD's best.
AMD needs to improve supply ASAP NVIDIA seems to be in the driver's seat. At the $649-and-up price points, NVIDIA's offerings seem to be widely available and deliver better performance to boot. Against the regular Fury, it seems that there are plenty of GTX 980 models available that would arguably be more attractive to buyers, especially as many factory overclocked versions seem to retail for under $549.
Although having product in greater supply won't fundamentally change the value proposition provided by the Radeon R9 Fury/Fury X, AMD at the very least needs to make sure that cards are available so that users who need to upgrade now (especially those who have been waiting for both AMD and NVIDIA to launch their respective chips) and have a slight preference for AMD will not be swayed by an NVIDIA offering.

            ","Graphics-chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announced its Radeon R9 Fury X flagship graphics processor last month at a $649 price point. The graphics processor was competent, but in third-party performance tests, NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) competing GeForce GTX 980 Ti -- which sells at the same price and launched ahead of the Fury X -- proved to be slightly faster and was also more power-efficient.
As fellow Fool Timothy Green put it, AMD's new offering simply wasn't good enough.
However, the NDAs recently lifted on AMD's Radeon R9 Fury. The Fury is based on the same chip as the higher-end Fury X, but it is partially disabled and air-cooled (as opposed to water-cooled in the case of the Fury X), and as a result, it will be sold for $100 less than its more premium counterpart. 
Although the Fury X failed to deliver the kind of performance and, ultimately, value that some AMD shareholders may have hoped for, might the lower-priced Radeon R9 Fury be a more viable contender in the high-end graphics processor market? Let's take a look.
Performs better than a GTX 980, but costs more The main issue with the Radeon R9 Fury X is that it offered slightly lower performance on average than the GTX 980 Ti but was priced the same as the NVIDIA offering. Given that NVIDIA is widely regarded as the ""premium"" brand and AMD more of the ""value"" brand, it's not clear how successful the Fury X will ultimately be. 
By contrast, the Radeon R9 Fury, according to Tech Power Up, delivers about 7.5% more performance on average than the $499 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 in the site's test suite at 2560-by-1440 resolution and nearly 15% more performance at a more demanding 4K resolution. 
That said, even though the Fury has a performance edge on the 980, the 980 looks more efficient in these tests, delivering better performance per watt at 2560-by-1440 and 4K resolutions than the Radeon R9 Fury X on the order of 19% and 12% respectively. 
In terms of value, the GTX 980 also delivers better performance per dollar than the R9 Fury, although the advantage to the 980 there is 12% at 2560-by-1440 resolution and 5% at 4K resolution.
Is the Radeon R9 Fury a winner? Based on Tech Power Up's tests of average frames per second, it looks like the Radeon R9 Fury is little faster than the GeForce GTX 980, but it's less efficient and offers slightly less performance per dollar.
It's not a bad effort from AMD. But at the price it's asking for this chip, it's hard to see AMD gaining significant amounts of market segment share with the Radeon R9 Fury, given the efficiency and performance-per-dollar deficit of the R9 Fury relative to the GTX 980.
What does this mean for AMD? At this point, I wouldn't be willing to bet on a significant improvement in AMD's graphics-related market segment share. 
That said, I plan to keep a close eye on the financial results and management commentary from both AMD and NVIDIA with respect to graphics to see if there's anything interesting going on with respect to market-share shifts and the potential impact such shifts could have on both graphics vendors' businesses.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has fallen on extremely hard times. In the CPU market, the Intel juggernaut has only grown more dominant in recent years, continually stealing away market share and pushing AMD's PC chip business into the red. In the GPU market, NVIDIA has grown its market share substantially over the past year, shipping 77.5% of discrete GPU's during the first quarter.
With Windows 10 set to launch later this month, the biggest new feature for PC gaming is DirectX 12, Microsoft's new graphics API, the software that allows applications to access the graphics hardware. The biggest improvement that DirectX 12 brings to the table is a vast reduction in overhead, freeing the CPU from wasting time sending commands to the GPU, in part by fully utilizing every core of a multi-core CPU.
Because AMD's CPUs generally have worse single-threaded performance compared with Intel CPUs, DirectX 12 should provide some performance benefits for a PC powered by an AMD CPU or APU. And regardless of the configuration, any game where the CPU is the bottleneck should see improvements in performance.
How much of an improvement will gamers see? Well, according to an article on AMD's website, a massive one:

Source: AMD.
A factor of 16 increase in graphics throughput on AMD's Radeon GPUs sounds impressive, but this slide is a bit deceptive. It measures draw calls, which are commands sent to the GPU from the CPU to draw something. DirectX 12 greatly reduces the overhead involved with each draw call, allowing for this massive increase.
But the number of draw calls is not a measure of performance. The GPU can only draw so much stuff per frame, and what DirectX 12 does is ensure that the GPU will never be waiting for commands from the CPU. The typical way that game developers have dealt with draw call limitations in the past has been to batch objects into the same draw call, thus reducing the total number of draw calls.
DirectX 12 is very similar to Mantle, AMD's now-defunct graphics API, and it's obvious from Mantle benchmarks that real-world situations yield far smaller benefits for AMD's hardware. According to Techspot, using Mantle instead of DirectX 11 produced performance gains around 5% in most cases where a discrete graphics card was used. AMD's APUs, which have integrated graphics, produced bigger gains in some cases, but only because AMD's CPUs are so weak compared with Intel's to begin with.
The actual improvements in frame rates that DirectX 12 delivers will depend on the situation, and while reducing CPU overhead gives game developers extra CPU cycles to work with, performance is ultimately limited by the GPU itself. In situations where the CPU wasn't the bottleneck to begin with, performance gains will be minimal.
Not a game changer for AMD There are certain cases where AMD's CPU will see major improvements in performance with DirectX 12. When the bottleneck is the CPU, the performance gap between AMD's and Intel's processors closes dramatically. Anandtech posted some benchmarks earlier this year that showed AMD's APUs neck-to-neck with Intel when running a very CPU-heavy test.
But in the real world, DirectX 12 doesn't save AMD from the fact that its CPUs are inferior to Intel's in terms of performance. And there's no reason to believe that DirectX 12 will give AMD's GPUs an advantage against NVIDIA, or vice versa. While some tests done by PC Perspective, and cited by AMD, suggests that AMD's R9 290X can deliver more draw calls per second compared to NVIDIA's GTX 980, that's not a meaningful measure of performance. The GTX 980 is substantially more powerful than the 290X, and DirectX 12 doesn't change that.
DirectX 12 is a great development for gamers, delivering a modest performance boost in most cases, and a large performance boost in certain cases. It's also great for developers, freeing them from having to deal with the draw call overhead that plagued DirectX 11. But it doesn't change AMD's competitive position in the CPU or GPU markets. DirectX 12 is no game changer for AMD.

            ","Struggling chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is expected to report its second quarter earnings result and provide guidance for its third quarter on an earnings call scheduled for Thursday, July 16.
The company recently negatively preannounced its second quarter results, stating that revenue will be down 8% from the prior quarter, against prior guidance of a 3% decline, give or take 3%. AMD also said that its gross profit margin for the quarter would be just 28%, down from prior expectations of 32%, as the company's revenue mix shifted more toward lower margin semicustom and embedded chip sales from PC microprocessors.
When AMD reports, here are three things that investors should watch closely.
Second half of 2015 guidance At its Financial Analyst Day, AMD said that it expected its revenue to grow by 15% in the second half of 2015 over that of the first half of 2015. I am looking for a forecast reduction on AMD's part, driven principally by a weaker-than-expected demand for its PC APU products.
Right now, analyst consensus calls for AMD to deliver $4.1 billion in sales for the balance of the year. Given that AMD did $1.03 billion in sales during the first quarter of the year and an 8% reduction from those levels puts sales for the second quarter at roughly $948 million, consensus estimates are calling for just 7.2% growth from the first half of the year to the second half of the year.
If AMD revises guidance for the second half of the year to something greater than a 7.2% increase from the first half, then this could be a positive for the stock. Similarly, if AMD's guidance for the second half comes in lower than that, shares could see further pressure.
Progress in gaining market segment share On the last earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su told analysts that management sees opportunities to grow its market segment share ""particularly in the graphics business"" during the second half of the year. I would be interested to hear management discuss its progress on this front and whether management still thinks it can regain share in the graphics and PC microprocessor markets during the second half of the year.
What about margins? During the first quarter of 2015, AMD's gross profit margin percentage (on a non-GAAP basis) was 32%, and now management expects that figure to come in at 28% in the second quarter.
It will be interesting to see how the company's gross profit margin percentage trends during the second half of 2015, particularly as management's prior margin guidance for the second half of the year was in the range of 32-34%. 
Given that AMD's margins were negatively affected by lower PC processor sales in the second quarter, a downward revision to PC processor shipment expectations might also mean lower margins in the second half of the year. Lower margins, coupled with potentially lower-than-expected revenue, might make it difficult for AMD to hit its forecast of profitability during the second half of the year.
Investing takeawayI'm not expecting much in the way of ""positive surprises"" on the upcoming earnings call. The situation for AMD doesn't look good, and in the near term I don't think there's much that the company can do about it. 
Over the medium term and the long term, AMD is betting on a wave of new products to help improve its competitive positioning in the PC market, grow its semicustom business, regain share in discrete graphics, and reestablish itself as a credible player in the server market.
Whether AMD is able to turn itself around and deliver on the vision that it outlined at its Financial Analyst Day, only time will tell.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is set to report its second-quarter earnings after market close on July 16. After an update from AMD on July 6, which served to cut the company's outlook substantially, the second quarter is expected to be even worse than previously anticipated. AMD now expects revenue to fall 8% sequentially, or about 34% year over year, compared with previous guidance of a 3% sequential decline. As the weak PC market ravages demand for the company's products, AMD is struggling to even predict how bad its results will be.
2015 guidance may need an adjustment Back in May, AMD held an analyst day event, providing an optimistic outlook for the rest of 2015. At the time, AMD expected to be profitable during the second half of the year, producing 15% revenue growth compared to the second half of 2014. Given the major correction to AMD's second quarter guidance, this may need an adjustment.
Along with lowering revenue expectations for the second quarter, AMD announced that it would be taking a $33 million charge associated with moving several product designs, originally designed for a 20nm node, to a leading-edge FinFET node. AMD has previously stated that some 20nm products would launch later this year, probably APUs, but this charge could mean that this is no longer the case.
AMD's optimistic forecast for the second half of the year was based on new products, but if no new APUs are set to be released, AMD will be relying on its recently announced graphics cards to do the job, along with a potential boost in PC demand related to Windows 10. IDC is predicting that the PC market will decline by 6.2% this year, so Windows 10 may not provide any boost at all.
AMD's new high-end Fury graphics cards introduced a real competitor to NVIDIA at the high end of the market after months of allowing NVIDIA free rein. Over the past few quarters, NVIDIA has grown its share of the add-in board market to 77.5%, up from around 60% that has been the norm over the past few years. Simply offering an alternative to NVIDIA should allow AMD to win back some market share, but since AMD failed to truly disrupt the market with its new products, NVIDIA should retain much of its advantage.
This leads to the conclusion that AMD's guidance for the second half is unrealistic, and just two months after first issuing it, I wouldn't be surprised if the company backtracked during its conference call. I don't see a scenario where AMD grows revenue by 15% and returns to profitability in the second half.
How big will the losses be? During the first quarter, AMD posted an operating loss of $137 million, down from an operating profit of $49 million during the first quarter of 2014. There was an $87 million restructuring charge included in that figure, but no matter how you slice it, AMD lost money during the quarter.
The computing and graphics segment posted a $75 million operating loss, down from a slight gain of $3 million during the same period in 2014. Meanwhile, the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment saw its operating profit nearly cut in half, to $45 million. Everything else, including that restructuring charge, contributed a $107 million operating loss.
With demand for PCs weaker than AMD anticipated, I would expect the computing and graphics segment to post an even bigger operating loss during the second quarter. The CPU and APU business is unlikely to improve going into the second half, and while graphics cards may provide a boost to sales, it's hard to imagine the segment posting a profit in the foreseeable future.
AMD can only cut costs so much, and R&D spending has already declined significantly over the past few years. A tech company without adequate R&D isn't going to stand the test of time, and it's becoming more difficult each quarter to believe that AMD can ever become competitive with Intel again. AMD investors still clinging to hopes of a turnaround aren't going to like AMD's second-quarter earnings.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is hurting today. Shares of the microprocessor designer plunged in Monday's after-hours session, setting new 52-week lows in the process. AMD stock opened 17% lower on Tuesday.
The kicker? AMD's dramatic drop follows news that should have been baked into the stock price all along. Investors just forgot all about it, distracted by rumored buyout talks and Father Time.
Right after Monday's closing bell, AMD published an update to its second-quarter guidance figures. And it was all bad news.
Second-quarter sales are now expected to fall 8% sequentially, which works out to roughly $950 million. AMD's original guidance pointed to a smaller 3% drop, or $1.0 billion. Either way, it's a big move from the year-ago quarter's $1.4 billion in total revenue.
At the same time, adjusted gross margin targets were reduced from 32% to 28%. A year ago, that margin sat at 35%.
Image source: AMD.
To explain these reduced expectations, AMD pointed to weak demand for PC systems. The more profitable enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom division accounted for 48% of AMD's sales in the first quarter. That portion will grow in the second period, which should help buttress AMD's margins, but that effect isn't strong enough to overcome the loss of PC-market sales volume.
Moreover, AMD will record a one-time charge of $33 million to account for several product designs moving onto the more advanced FinFET manufacturing process.
If you're wondering how long the design lead times can be in the semiconductor industry, let me point out that AMD first announced its FinFET ambitions 13 years ago, and is only now taking advantage of this hyper-efficient design method. What once was seen as a ""ten-fold performance leap"" is now just another incremental step in the evolution of processor designs. This stuff takes time, people.
But let's get back to the present day. Or rather, to the magical far-away haze of two weeks ago.
That's when memory chip producer Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) announced terrible second-quarter results and equally weak forward guidance, all due to a soft PC market. As investors digested this hard-hitting prognosis, Micron's shares fell 22% over the next two trading days. AMD followed suit with a 9% plunge of its own. Even industry titan Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) took that news on the chin, as shares lost 5% of their value.
Intel and Micron have stayed down since that fateful report, but AMD hasn't. According to the rumor mill, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) weighed buying out AMD to gain control of the Xbox One's central processor technology (which also underpins the PS4 and Wii U rival systems). The buyout looks like a bad idea for Microsoft, and even if these talks are real, they're not likely to result in an AMD buyout.
Still, the mere hint of a positive exit strategy was enough to hold AMD shares aloft. As of Monday night, the stock had rebounded nearly 6% from the darkest hours of Micron's PC industry revelations.
The Microsoft buffer is all gone now and then some. Again, AMD is trading at multiyear lows this morning. AMD is set to report full results on July 16, the day after Intel's second-quarter update. After these two announcements, we'll know a lot more about the overall health of the PC markets -- and it won't be a pretty picture.
But you can't say that Micron didn't warn you. AMD only underscored what we had already been told.

            ","What: Shares of semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell as much as 18% on very heavy volume in the early Tuesday session. The company yesterday reduced its second-quarter guidance, one week before the final report. By 11:15 a.m., the stock was down 15.4%.
So what: In a guidance update published Monday night, AMD reduced its second-quarter revenue guidance from $1 billion to roughly $950 million. The gross margin outlook was also diminished from 32% to 28%, all due to unexpectedly slow orders from the PC systems sector.
Now what: AMD shares had already taken a recent haircut when fellow semiconductor veteran Micron Technology blamed a weak second quarter on PC-market troubles. The stock recovered nicely amid buyout speculation, but this late-hour guidance reduction took all the wind out of AMD's sails in short order. AMD shares hit multiyear lows in early Tuesday trading.
Investors are now looking back at a steep 50% price drop in AMD shares over the last year, and this PC market update doesn't indicate a quick end to the misery. Recently appointed CEO Lisa Su faces an incredibly difficult turnaround task here, and maybe even an impossible one.
Tune in to AMD's full earnings report on July 16 for a deeper dive into this troubled company's progress and prospects (or lack thereof). Until then, rest assured that PC vendors aren't building a ton of systems right now. Expect the back-to-school and holiday seasons to show lower PC sales than usual, with all that implies for component suppliers to that sector.

            ","Just 10 days from its formal earnings release, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) pre-announced that its revenue for the quarter will come in lower than expected. In particular, AMD is now calling for an 8% sequential drop in sales from the first quarter, a significantly larger decline than the 3% drop it had originally called for.
This weakness, per AMD's press release, has been driven by ""weaker than expected consumer PC demand,"" leading to lower APU sales to system vendors.
AMD also reduced its gross profit margin guidance for the quarter (on a non-GAAP basis) from 32% to just 28%. This reduction is due to a ""higher mix of Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment sales,"" as a result of the aforementioned PC weakness.
Finally, the company announced that its GAAP gross profit margin will take a one-time hit associated with scrapping product designs that had been started on the 20-nanometer manufacturing node but are now being transitioned to FinFET manufacturing.
Although AMD laid out an optimistic long-term view at its recent Financial Analyst Day, the reality here is that AMD's business seems to be going from ""bad"" to ""worse."" 
Is this ""just"" a PC problem, or is it an AMD problem? It won't be too long now before both AMD and PC processor peer Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) report their full quarterly results. A question that will be of critical importance to AMD is whether this revenue shortfall is due just to the rough shape the PC market's in, or if AMD is continuing to lose significant market share to Intel.
My guess is that the full quarterly results from both chipmakers will show a combination of both. I expect that Intel's Skylake chips will offer better performance per watt than anything AMD will be able to field this year. Furthermore, given the status of the PC market and that Intel has factories to keep filled, I wouldn't be surprised if Intel gets more aggressive on pricing its chips in a bid to capture additional market share.  
Will guidance for the second half of the year need to come down? At AMD's financial analyst day back in May, CFO Devinder Kumar said the company expects to grow revenue by 15%, give or take 3%, in the second half of the year from levels seen in the first half of 2015. Additionally, Kumar said AMD's gross profit margin will move from 32% in the first half to 32%-34% in the second half and operating expenses would come down from $715 million to between $680 million and $700 million.
All told, that prior guidance called for AMD to see a net profit and positive free cash flow in the second half of the year.
I expect AMD to bring down its full-year revenue guidance, although by how much isn't clear yet. In its prior guidance for the second half of the year, AMD was looking for operating profit of about $69 million (assuming $2.3 billion in sales, 33% gross profit margin, and $690 million in operating expenses).
Note that AMD brought in $1.03 billion in revenue last quarter and now expects revenue for the second quarter to be down by 8% from that level, implying a first half of 2015 revenue base of about $1.98 billion.
If AMD lowers its second-half growth estimates to 10% from 15% (which still might be optimistic) and hits the low end of its previously stated gross profit margin (32%-34%) and operating expense ($680 million-$700 million) ranges, it could still eke out a $17 million operating profit for the second half of the year.
However, if AMD guides for revenue growth in the second half of the year that's meaningfully lower than that, or if its gross margin comes under further pressure, then AMD could very well wind up losing money in the second half of the year as well.
Things don't look good for AMD today and it's hard to see things getting much better anytime soon.

            ","Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is rumored to be interested in acquiring chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), according to recent reports from Reuters and KitGuru. The takeover talks reportedly started a few months ago, although additional details are currently unknown.
AMD currently has a market cap of $1.8 billion, and Microsoft has $95.3 billion in cash, so it would be an easy purchase for the tech giant. But before investors get too excited about this buzz reviving AMD stock -- which has fallen more than 40% over the past 12 months -- they should understand that these rumors are unlikely to bear fruit.

Possible reasons for buying AMDAMD has been losing ground to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in x86 processors and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphics cards for years, yet it recently found a comfortable niche with SoCs (system on chips) for gaming consoles. AMD currently provides the SoCs for Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One -- the two top consoles of the current generation.
Microsoft and Sony both pay AMD roughly $100 per console for those SoCs, which merge the CPU and GPU on a single chip. Microsoft has sold 12.6 million Xbox Ones since late 2013, which equals $1.26 billion in payments to AMD. Therefore, buying AMD to save the gross profits on those payments (estimated to be about 20%) sounds like a good idea. Sony would be ironically forced to pay Microsoft to keep using AMD SoCs if Microsoft bought AMD, and Microsoft could further lower the price of the Xbox One to undercut the PS4.

AMD claims that its graphically powerful SoCs are well-suited for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications. If Microsoft acquires AMD, it could install those SoCs in the HoloLens AR headset and similar devices. AMD also owns a software suite for VR headsets, known as LiquidVR, which reduces the lag in VR image processing that can cause motion sickness. That software, which only works with AMD hardware, could be useful if Microsoft expands its presence into the VR market.
But here's the problemMicrosoft and AMD certainly have some aligned interests, but AMD has huge flaws that could offset any synergistic gains. AMD's business is split into two parts -- the Computing & Graphics (x86 chips, GPUs, and graphics cards) division and the Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (SoCs, embedded chips) one.
Last quarter, revenue at Computing & Graphics, which accounted for 52% of AMD's top line, fell 38% annually to $532 million, and its operating loss widened from $39 million to $107 million. This was due to lower PC sales and competitive pressure, which forced AMD to lower prices to preserve market share.
AMD's EESC business, which generated the remaining 48% of its top line last quarter, fared slightly better. Sales slipped just 7% annually to $498 million, but operating income dropped 47% to $45 million. AMD blamed ""seasonally lower sales"" of semi-custom SoCs, hinting that rising sales of consoles wasn't enough to lift the entire business. Therefore, it's impractical for Microsoft to inherit all those problems just to cut the cost of the Xbox One or gain an early edge in the fledgling AR/VR markets.
A partial sale wouldn't workTo cut off the burnt crust, Microsoft could theoretically buy AMD's EESC division and leave the Computing & Graphics unit with AMD. Unfortunately, AMD probably wouldn't agree to that partial sale for two reasons.
First, the SoCs which Microsoft needs are based on technologies developed for its server microprocessors and high-end graphics cards. Selling one unit without the other would cause a major fracture in R&D. Second, the EESC business is AMD's only way to offset the ongoing losses at its Computing & Graphics division.
But even if AMD sold the EESC business to Microsoft, the division's lackluster bottom-line growth would weigh down Microsoft's earnings, which are already under pressure from offering free/discounted Windows licenses and year-long trial offers of Office 365. Analysts are already expecting Microsoft's earnings to drop 8% this year, and buying AMD -- either as a whole or in bits -- would likely lead to downward revisions.
Shop elsewhere, MicrosoftAMD's market cap is basically pocket change for Microsoft, but inheriting all of AMD's problems simply wouldn't be worth the effort. Over the past two years, Microsoft has bought plenty of smaller companies to boost its cloud business, which had an annual run rate of $6.3 billion last quarter. Therefore, it makes more sense to buy smaller CRM, machine learning, or analytics firms to grow its cloud business than it does to acquire a fallen chipmaker like AMD.

After months of speculation and waiting, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) finally took the wraps off of its new high-end graphics cards. The fastest of the bunch, the Fury X, is priced at $649, meant to compete directly with NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) identically priced GTX 980 Ti. With new high-bandwidth memory and a water-cooling solution, the Fury X is certainly an impressive piece of hardware. But while AMD has successfully closed the performance gap with NVIDIA at the high end, it failed to launch anything truly disruptive.

A look at the Fury X AMD actually announced two lines of new graphics cards in June. The Radeon 300 series encompasses rebrands of the company's previous Radeon 200 series, while three high-end cards, the Nano, the Fury, and the Fury X, are built on a new iteration of AMD's Graphics Core Next architecture. These high-end cards come with high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, and the Fury X sports 8.6 teraflops of single-precision floating point performance.
AMD has built a very fast graphics card with state-of-the-art memory technology, and its water-cooling solution allows the Fury X to be about 3 inches shorter than AMD's previous flagship, the 290X. After months of being unable to effectively compete with NVIDIA at the high end of the market, the Fury X officially puts AMD back in the game.
In terms of performance, the Fury X is very close to the GTX 980 Ti. In a review on Tom's Hardware, the reviewer said the Fury X delivers performance surreally similar to NVIDIA's 980 Ti, with the 980 Ti having a slight advantage at lower resolutions and the Fury X having a slight advantage at higher resolutions.
AMD's use of HBM doesn't seem to give the Fury X any discernible advantage. The fraction of gamers playing at 4K resolutions, where the Fury X is at its best against the 980 Ti, is still minuscule, according to Steam's hardware and software survey. 4K gaming will certainly become more prevalent as the price of 4K monitors comes down, but with NVIDIA expected to use HBM in its upcoming Pascal graphics cards in 2016, being first might not yield any benefits at all for AMD.
What it means for AMD When AMD launched its previous lineup of graphics cards, the Radeon 200 series, in 2013, the company successfully disrupted NVIDIA. With the flagship 290X boasting better performance and a lower price than NVIDIA's high-end offerings, NVIDIA was forced to slash prices on its graphics cards in order to compete.
NVIDIA returned the favor when it launched its GTX 970 and 980 last September. NVIDIA priced its new high-end cards extremely aggressively, forcing AMD to slash prices. The GTX 970, which cost about $330 at launch, wasn't too far off from the performance of AMD's 290X, which was priced at $550 at the time. And the GTX 980 vastly outperformed every single AMD GPU graphics card available.
This trend of NVIDIA and AMD constantly leapfrogging each other comes to an end with the launch of the Fury X. Instead of disrupting NVIDIA, AMD has simply matched its rival, offering the same performance for the same price. While NVIDIA had the high end of the market largely to itself since September, AMD will not enjoy the same advantage.
AMD will almost certainly win back some market share at the high end, the result of simply having a viable alternative to NVIDIA's products. Over the past few quarters, NVIDIA has vastly increased its market share of the discrete GPU market, and I suspect some of these gains will now be erased.
But without truly disruptive products from AMD, NVIDIA will likely remain the market leader for the foreseeable future. Instead of both companies leapfrogging each other with each new product launch, NVIDIA has taken a leap forward, and AMD has taken months to simply catch up.
This could be the inevitable result of AMD slashing its research and development budget over the past few years. NVIDIA actually surpassed AMD in R&D spending in 2013, despite AMD having a far broader business, competing in PC CPUs, server CPUs, and discrete graphics cards.
AMD's Fury X is an impressive graphics card, but it's not good enough. AMD needed to disrupt NVIDIA, but Fury X doesn't do that. While AMD will likely reclaim some market share, the company runs the risk of being permanently stuck in second place behind NVIDIA.

            ","The lower shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) go, the wilder the buyout rumors seem to get. This time, we have KitGuru reporting that it's heard that software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is interested in buying the struggling chipmaker.
Microsoft reportedly ""approached AMD several months ago,"" but the results of the talks are ""unclear,"" according to the report.
Details of this rumored acquisition end there, but KitGuru's Anton Shilov suggests that buying AMD could help Microsoft save ""around a billion per year on Xbox One chips."" He then further suggests that if Microsoft could get AMD to put together ""appropriate chips for smartphones and tablets,"" Microsoft could save even more money.
I think this ""rumor"" is unlikely to have much substance, and the cited rationale behind such a deal is tenuous at best. Here's why.
How much money would Microsoft really save on Xbox One chips? The first argument that Shilov makes is that Microsoft could save about ""a billion per year"" by no longer having to pay a third party to buy chips for the Xbox One. However, it's my understanding that Microsoft essentially funds the development of the chip upfront, relieving AMD of the R&D burden associated with the chip development.
In exchange for funding the development, the per-unit margins that AMD is able to command when it actually sells these chips to the customer are lower.
According to AMD CFO Devinder Kumar on the company's Q1 2014 earnings call, gross profit margin on the game console chips is lower than the corporate average. Given that AMD reported 35% gross profit margin in that quarter, we can assume that console chip gross profit margins were lower than that.
To figure out just how much Microsoft would save on console chips if it didn't have to hand over any margins, let's assume that the chips bring in a 30% gross profit margin for AMD. This would mean that Microsoft would save -- assuming KitGuru's figure of $1 billion worth of console chip sales per year -- $300 million per year in Xbox chip cost of goods sold.
It hardly seems likely that Microsoft would want to buy the entirety of AMD just to save $300 million per year on semi-custom game console chips.
Chips for smartphones and tablets? Shilov also says that AMD could help Microsoft put together smartphone processors for tablets and phones, presumably for Microsoft's Surface tablets and its Lumia line of smartphones.
The smartphone hypothesis makes no sense, as AMD's CPU and graphics IP doesn't appear to be targeted at smartphones, and good IP can be licensed from the likes of ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) and Imagination (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). AMD doesn't bring to the table any modem technology, either, which is critical for smartphones. If Microsoft were really interested building phone chips, AMD is hardly the go-to M&A target for that.
In tablets, such an acquisition might make a little more sense, since AMD brings to the table an X86 license. However, I don't think Microsoft has the scale with its Surface and Surface Pro line of systems to justify the huge R&D expense of trying to out-engineer Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) low-power X86 offerings.
This just doesn't sound plausible I'd say that this rumored acquisition is highly unlikely. As of writing, the rumor seems to be pushing the stock higher in after-hours trading, but I wouldn't be surprised if any buyout-rumor gains eventually evaporate -- as they have many times in the past.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has confirmed that it will finally be announcing its new slate of graphics cards on June 16. Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has had the high-end GPU market mostly to itself since launching the GTX 970 and GTX 980 last September at aggressive prices.
Just a couple of weeks before AMD's event, and just a couple of months after launching the powerful GTX Titan X, NVIDIA has once again disrupted the market with the GTX 980 Ti. The $649 graphics card is nearly as fast as the $999 Titan X, and it's capable of playing games at a 4K resolution. AMD's task of winning back market share just became more difficult.
A look at the GTX 980 Ti The eventual launch of a Ti variant of the GTX 980 was inevitable, but it is surprising that it came so soon after the launch of the Titan X. It's also surprising how close in performance the 980 Ti comes to the Titan X. While the 980 Ti sports about 8% fewer CUDA cores and texture units, and cuts the Titan X's 12GB of memory in half, real-world performance is very similar for both cards. Anandtech did a full review, and its conclusion was that there is only a 3% difference in performance between the two cards, despite the Titan X being priced $350 higher.

Source: NVIDIA
NVIDIA has essentially made the Titan X irrelevant, a bizarre move on the surface. But with AMD's new graphics cards on the way, NVIDIA likely wanted to be proactive. Instead of allowing AMD to launch a new high-end card at a lower price than the Titan X before launching a response, NVIDIA has come out swinging with the 980 Ti, putting pressure on AMD.
AMD has a problem There has been no shortage of rumors regarding AMD's upcoming graphics cards over the past few months. What we know is that the highest-end GPUs will sport high-bandwidth-memory, or HBM, which should give AMD's cards an advantage at the highest of resolutions. What we don't know is how much this new memory technology will add to the price of AMD's cards, or how it will ultimately perform compared to the new 980 Ti.
Some unofficial benchmarks of AMD's new high-end cards have leaked, showing that AMD's top new product performs about the same as the Titan X and the 980 Ti. That sounds about right, although we'll have to wait for official benchmarks to know for sure.
If AMD's highest-end GPU is in the same ballpark as the 980 Ti in terms of performance, the company is going to be unable to charge much more than $650. Previous rumors put the launch price of AMD's highest-end card at $899, which would likely be a non-starter given the 980 Ti's price, so my guess is that the card will ultimately launch at a lower price.
AMD is playing catch up to NVIDIA, and that puts the company in a difficult situation. NVIDIA has run away with the discrete GPU market in recent quarters, accounting for 76% of shipments during the fourth quarter of 2014, and AMD is going to have to blow away potential customers with its new products in order to win much of that market share back. Simply matching NVIDIA on performance is unlikely to turn things around for the company.
NVIDIA's strategy makes sense While essentially making the Titan X obsolete with the launch of the 980 Ti, NVIDIA has managed to back AMD into a corner. While NVIDIA had the freedom to sell a $1,000 high-end graphics card for months without any real competition, AMD has a hard limit on how much it can charge, assuming that the performance of its flagship card is similar to that of the 980 Ti.
We'll soon find out if AMD has any tricks up its sleeve, or if the company's adoption of HBM gives it an advantage. But at the moment, NVIDIA appears to be in control.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), better known as AMD, fell by $0.02, or less than 1%, in Tuesday's trading session, closing at $2.29. This was despite receiving a very bullish rating initiation from one Wall Street firm, which believes AMD's shares could more than double.
So what: Gus Richard, the covering analyst at Northland Capital, initiated coverage on AMD yesterday with an ""outperform"" rating (the equivalent of a ""buy"") and a price target of $5 per share. If AMD were to hit Richard's target, it would deliver a 118% return to shareholders.
Richard's bullish thesis amid a sea of skepticism surrounding AMD involves the expected growth of data centers and the reliance on x86-compatible chips. The only two companies that supply chips in this realm are chip-making powerhouse Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD. Because Richards believes that rewriting the software that's the backbone of today's data centers would take a lot of time and effort, he contends that x86 will ""continue to dominate the server market.""
Richard also believes that even if x86 loses its grasp in data centers in the U.S., AMD could be an attractive takeover target. Richard cites a number of possible suitors in his note to investors, including Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), Intel, and potentially a China-based company since China is heavily dependent on x86 processors.
Richard estimates that AMD could have about 10% market share in data center processors by 2017 (or about $1 billion in sales), which should lead to gross margin expansion and EPS of $0.50 for the full year.
Source: AMD via Facebook.
Now what: The real question that investors need to ask here is whether you trust Northland Capital's assessment or believe AMD is a dead duck.
On a fundamental basis it's tough to argue against the dead duck theory. AMD is in the midst of a multi-year businesses turnaround that continues to be pushed out by a weakening PC market and the heavy spending required to enter highly competitive next-generation product markets, such as the cloud, gaming, and data centers. Wall Street projects that AMD will lose money on an annual basis until 2017. However, unlike Richard's $0.50 EPS estimate for the full-year, Wall Street's consensus is a mere $0.03 profit.
However, playing second fiddle to Intel can have its perks, too. Even maintaining 10%-15% market share in data centers could net AMD substantial growth in the coming decade. Additionally, AMD has a growing presence in gaming consoles and has made significant headway in gaining microserver market share.
Personally, I've been weighing an investment in AMD for some time now, and I'm liking its potential for a turnaround. I would suggest that only those with a high tolerance for risk even consider investing in AMD, since it does have a number of competitive challenges yet to overcome. However, with new management in place and AMD targeting higher growth prospects, I suspect it's only a matter of time before the company puts its struggles firmly in the rearview mirror.

            ","The wait for new graphics cards from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is nearly over. After losing quite a bit of market share to rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past few quarters, AMD is expected to launch new products by the end of June. NVIDIA has had the high-end of the market mostly to itself after launching the GTX 970 and 980 last September, and the GTX Titan X in March -- AMD desperately needs to reclaim some market share.
But putting out competitive hardware will not be enough. A little more than one year ago, NVIDIA officially introduced GameWorks, a set of tools and code libraries that provide game developers with the ability to easily integrate advanced effects into their games. I wrote last year that GameWorks had the potential to give NVIDIA a competitive advantage in the GPU business. With the hoopla surrounding the recently released PC game, The Witcher 3, and its use of GameWorks, it appears as though that is exactly what's happening.
NVIDIA has a software advantage Software has always been important in the GPU business in the form of graphics drivers. This is the software that allows a PC to communicate with the GPU itself, and both AMD and NVIDIA continually update their drivers to work better with new and existing games.
However, you only have to look at the NVIDIA and AMD support websites to see that NVIDIA provides driver updates far more frequently. The latest official NVIDIA driver was released on May 18th, providing a variety of fixes and optimizations for The Witcher 3. On the other hand, the latest official AMD driver was released all the way back in December of last year, and its latest beta driver, which provided optimizations for Grand Theft Auto V, is more than a month old.
This discrepancy may simply be an issue of resources. AMD used to provide monthly driver updates, but it ended that practice back in 2012. This coincided with the beginning of a three-year streak of annual losses for the company, one which may turn into a four-year streak in 2015.
While NVIDIA and AMD routinely work with game developers to optimize games for their respective hardware, GameWorks takes things one step further. GameWorks provides code for advanced effects like soft shadows, high-quality skin shading, and the simulation and rendering of realistic hair and fur. These are all complicated and computationally intensive effects, and GameWorks saves developers from needing to reinvent the wheel.
GameWorks is obviously optimized to work best on NVIDIA hardware, and in certain cases, it works very poorly on AMD hardware. The Witcher 3 makes use of GameWorks' hair and fur rendering, and the developer has stated that it encourages users of AMD GPUs to disable the feature completely, because performance may be unacceptable due to the lack of optimizations with AMD hardware.
AMD is working on new beta drivers that fix these performance issues, but it may be too little, too late. GameWorks' hair and fur rendering was demoed in The Witcher 3 last year, so AMD had plenty of time to develop optimized drivers that were ready to go at launch. Again, a lack of resources compared to NVIDIA was likely the main issue.
What AMD needs to do New GPUs alone will not solve AMD's market share problems. GameWorks and other NVIDIA technologies are finding their way into an increasing number of PC games, and AMD needs to fight back with its own software. AMD's Mantle, the graphics API that the company developed as an alternative to DirectX, is now dead. Although it certainly influenced the development of DirectX 12, it did nothing to boost sales of AMD products, as I previously predicted.
AMD needs its own version of GameWorks. It needs to release optimized drivers at the same frequency as NVIDIA, and it needs to ensure that any performance issues are resolved before games are launched, not after. With AMD currently unprofitable and its resources spread across various businesses beyond graphics, catching up with NVIDIA on the software front will be a challenge, to say the least.

            ","Over the past few years, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has struggled with losing market share in the x86 and graphics chip markets against rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). To avoid directly competing against those two market leaders, AMD has expanded into smaller niche markets.
Two such markets are augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), which AMD highlighted as ""key drivers"" of future growth during its analyst day in early May. AMD stated that the AR and VR markets could grow from nearly nothing today to $150 billion by 2020, citing research firm Digi-Capital's estimates. 80% of that revenue is expected to come from AR devices, while the remaining 20% will be attributed to VR ones.

Source: AMD.
Will AMD really profit from that growth, or is it merely pegging its name to a hyped-up fledgling market?
Why AMD believes in AR and VRAMD believes it can naturally evolve its presence in the gaming industry into the AR and VR markets. AMD's APUs (advanced processing units) combine CPUs with GPUs (graphics processor units) on a single chip, making them ideal all-in-one solutions for devices that require heavy graphical processing horsepower. Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One -- the two top-selling eighth-generation gaming consoles -- both use AMD's semi-custom low-power APUs.
Therefore, Sony and Microsoft's upcoming AR/VR headsets will be directly powered by AMD's APUs if they're hooked up to consoles. In 2016, Sony will launch Project Morpheus, its VR headset for the PS4. Microsoft will also eventually launch HoloLens, an AR headset that overlays virtual objects onto real things, for Xbox One and Windows PCs.

Intel's HD Graphics and NVIDIA's Project Denver are also all-in-one APU chipsets, but neither one matches AMD's presence in console gaming.
A growing marketSony and Microsoft aren't the only companies expanding into the AR/VR market. Facebook is expected to launch its VR headset, Oculus Rift, in 2016. Google got developers interested in VR apps with its DIY Cardboard headset, then partnered with Mattel to transform its classic View-Master into a VR viewing device. Google also invested over half a billion dollars into Magic Leap, the developer of an AR headset that could potentially compete against HoloLens.

The arrival of those headsets will boost demand for beefier GPUs. However, some of them will need to be paired with mobile devices and PCs -- neither of which is AMD's forte. The mobile GPU market currently belongs to Qualcomm and Apple. Intel controls 72% of the overall GPU market, while NVIDIA controls 76% of the add-in graphics board market, according to research company JPR.
AMD's lack of GPU muscle in those markets could impact its ability to grow its AR/VR presence beyond gaming consoles. Moreover, there's no guarantee that Sony and Microsoft won't switch to NVIDIA or another chipmaker for APUs in future consoles.
Don't forget about the softwareHowever, AMD has an alternative way to infiltrate the VR market: software. In March, AMD unveiled LiquidVR, a suite of technologies designed to reduce delays, or latency, in VR image processing, which can cause motion sickness. The suite only works with VR content running on AMD hardware. Several major AR/VR partners, including Facebook's Oculus VR, are already integrating LiquidVR into their devices.
Until now, reducing latency was mainly considered a hardware issue. Last year, NVIDIA claimed its GeForce GTX 980 could reduce the Oculus Rift's latency by up to 50% in comparison to older cards. However, the GTX 980 is a top-tier card that costs $500-$600. Add that to the expected $200-$400 price tag for the Rift, and customers might have to pay $1,000 for an optimal VR experience.
With LiquidVR, VR applications might eventually run smoothly on cheaper graphics cards. The suite is also an early step toward a unified API for VR gaming, which could attract a lot more developers and vendors as the market matures.
Not a magic bulletThe AR/VR market is an exciting market to watch, but it's not a magic bullet to solve AMD's core problems.
Last quarter, revenue at both AMD's Computing & Graphics unit and its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) unit fell annually. The former posted an operating loss of $75 million, while the latter -- which houses AMD's higher-growth console and microserver SoCs -- stayed in the black, with an operating profit of $45 million. 
Rising sales of VR/AR devices might boost console sales, which could cast a halo effect on sales of PC-based add-in graphics boards. If the VR market matures and LiquidVR becomes an industry standard, AMD could possibly sell cheaper add-in graphics boards that can match the VR performance of pricier NVIDIA cards. 
Unfortunately, none of that will likely happen within the coming year. Until then, AMD must find other ways to get its top- and bottom-line growth back on track.

            ","During the past few years, Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) strategy has not made a lot of sense. The company has been trying to compete with Intel in both the PC and server chip markets, while at the same time facing off against NVIDIA in the GPU market, only to find itself losing market share across the board. On top of that, AMD has launched a variety of ambitious initiatives, despite the fact that its research and development spending has been slashed in each of the past three years.
Earlier this month, AMD held its 2015 Financial Analyst Day, and it seems that the company is finally taking the proper steps to narrow its focus and turn the business around. There are still no guarantees, and returning to profitability will be a difficult task, but it looks like AMD is finally doing something right.
Picking its spots During its financial analyst day presentation, AMD listed four recent challenges: a weak PC market, channel inventory, market share losses, and investments not being sufficiently focused. It is the last point that has caused most of AMD's problems. The company has been throwing its limited resources behind all sorts of initiatives, and this lack of focus has allowed the competition to continually win market share.
About a year ago, AMD announced Project SkyBridge, an initiative to create a single platform for both x86 and ARM CPUs. Project SkyBridge is now dead, and the company's custom K12 ARM core has been delayed to 2017. These decisions are likely for the best: Project SkyBridge was too ambitious for AMD, and with the ARM server market still in its nascent stages, rushing a custom ARM core to market makes little sense.
Along with scaling back its ARM ambitions, AMD is exiting its SeaMicro dense server business. AMD acquired SeaMicro in 2012 for $334 million in an attempt to take advantage of the growth in micro-servers. However, as CEO Lisa Su stated during the latest conference call, the market has not developed fast enough, and AMD's core competency is processors, not systems. That is $334 million wasted and a costly lesson learned.
The most important part of its new strategy isn't where the company is focusing but where the company isn't focusing. AMD is not going after the smartphone market or the low-end tablet market, and it is reducing its exposure to the low-end of the PC market. And while the Internet of Things is expected to be a huge opportunity in the coming years, the company will not be putting its chips into IoT endpoints such as smartwatches and smart appliances.
These decisions are the right ones. There is simply no way that AMD can compete in these markets against Intel and companies making ARM chips. Intel barely has a presence in smartphones today, and it had to heavily subsidize its tablet chips to gain market share. That is despite Intel spending billions maintaining its state-of-the-art fabrication facilities and outspending AMD on research and development by more than a factor of 10.
The plan to win market share The key to the new CPU strategy is Zen, the new high-performance core expected to launch in 2016. AMD is now focusing on the high-end of the PC market. With Intel currently facing essentially no competition there, it is likely the best opportunity to win back some PC market share. Zen is also the key to AMD's server strategy, and the company hopes to gain server market share starting in 2017.
With Zen, AMD has switched to using simultaneous multithreading -- what Intel calls Hyper-Threading. In its previous CPU architecture, AMD used a different form of multithreading, and this contributed to its lackluster performance compared to Intel chips. Zen should help close the performance gap.
In the GPU market, AMD has been losing market share to NVIDIA for the past few quarters, but the company plans to launch new GPUs in the next few months. These will be the first to use high-bandwidth memory, which should give the new cards an advantage when it comes to gaming at 4K resolutions. NVIDIA will likely launch some new GPUs in response, so there is again no guarantee that AMD will be able to regain ground in the market.
AMD is still going to have a tough time winning market share in the CPU and GPU markets, but for the first time in years, its strategy make sense. The company no longer appears to be flailing, pushing all sorts of initiatives and trying to compete on multiple fronts. Instead, AMD is starting to focus on the areas where it has the best chance at being competitive, and that should be a welcome development for investors.

            ","Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have fallen 43% over the past 12 months. Its core CPU and GPU businesses were respectively marginalized by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA, which caused AMD's average selling prices to fall across the board. A slowdown in the PC market exacerbated that pain.
Last quarter, AMD reported a net loss of $180 million, compared to a loss of $20 million a year earlier. Revenue plunged 26% year over year to $1.03 billion. Although many investors believe there's not much value left in AMD stock, let's take a contrarian view and discuss three ways the chipmaker could save itself.
1. Expanding into Chromebooks and IoT chipsAMD hasn't made chips for Chromebooks or Internet of Things, or IoT, devices, while Intel has embraced both high-growth markets. Research firm Gartner expects Chromebooks to claim 4.3% of the PC market by 2017, up from 1.5% in 2014. IDC expects the total IoT market to grow from $1.9 trillion in 2013 to $7.1 trillion by 2020.

AMD's reasoning was the same for both: it didn't want to weigh down its bottom line with low-margin products. Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster called Chromebooks a ""rock-bottom"" market at the ISSCC conference in February. In January, AMD's since-departed computing and graphics chief John Byrne told VentureBeat that he wasn't ""in the business to lose money"" when it came to selling IoT chips.
Yet by avoiding both markets, AMD ignores two key facts. Selling low-margin chips would still generate fresh revenue growth. Considering that AMD's computing and graphics revenue plunged 38% annually last quarter, it wouldn't be a terrible idea. Second, it ignores economies of scale: if AMD can sell low margin products at sufficiently high volumes, the cost per unit could drop.
AMD probably isn't confident that it can sell enough Chromebook or IoT chips to bring those costs down. If it failed to do so, the unit's operating loss -- which already stood at $75 million last quarter -- could widen. Nonetheless, AMD shouldn't prematurely dismiss those two opportunities for growth.
2. Spinning off its computing and graphics divisionConsidering how poorly the computing and graphics division has fared, it might be wise to spin off or sell the unit. After all, the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom, or EESC, unit generates plenty of revenue on its own:

Moreover, AMD's EESC business remains profitable, although its operating income fell 47% year over year to $45 million last quarter. The EESC business is mainly propped up by sales of system-on-chips for Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4, but it has also expanded into microservers, which IDC forecasts will account for 10% of all servers by 2016.
Unfortunately, AMD recently shuttered its SeaMicro brand of microservers, which were considered a potential showcase for its new ARM-based processors. Other microserver makers could still install AMD's ARM-based processors in their microservers, but there are already plenty of other ARM-based microserver chipmakers in that field, such as Texas Instruments. 
If AMD sells its computing and graphics division, it could invest that cash back into strengthening its EESC business. However, the EESC unit might be too dependent on IP from the Computing and Graphics segment, and the two businesses could be too tightly intertwined to be separated. Moreover, if AMD becomes even smaller, it could lose whatever pricing power it has left in the market.  
3. Sell itself to mobile chipmakersTherefore, a better option would be for AMD to shop itself around to potential buyers. With a market cap of just $1.8 billion, AMD could be easily acquired by a larger chipmaker such as Samsung or Qualcomm.

Both companies, which make ARM-based chips, would benefit from acquiring AMD's license to manufacture x86 chips. That could help either one expand from mobile devices and into Intel's core market of laptops and desktops.
However, it's not that simple. Any company that buys AMD would also inherit the company's $2.3 billion in debt. AMD also had a negative free cash flow of $163 million over the past 12 months, and has less than $1 billion in cash and short-term holdings. Meanwhile, both of its business units are posting negative top- and bottom-line growth.
The takeawayAMD isn't a safe stock by any means. These three lifesaving strategies are long shots that might never happen. However, they offer valuable insights into AMD's previous business decisions, and highlight the value that might remain in its core businesses.

            ","Chipmakers AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have certainly seen better days. Shares of AMD have fallen over 40% in the past 12 months, while shares of Qualcomm are down over 10%. On the other hand, Intel -- which competes against AMD in x86 CPUs and Qualcomm in mobile chips -- is up nearly 25%. 
However, bottom-fishing investors might be wondering if AMD or Qualcomm make good contrarian picks. Let's take a look at both companies to see which one is a better ""bad news buy.""
AMD: Stuck between two giantsA decade ago, AMD realized that it could not compete directly against Intel and its dominant market share in x86 chips. As a result, AMD acquired graphics card maker ATI in 2006 to diversify its top line with high-end graphics cards and APUs. But between the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2014, Nvidia increased its market share of add-in graphic boards from 65% to 76%, according to research firm JPR. AMD saw its share fall from 35% to 24%.
To avoid being crushed between Intel and Nvidia, AMD focused on strengthening its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) segment, which includes server and embedded processors, SoC products, engineering services, and royalties. The EESC unit received a major boost when Microsoft and Sony put its SoCs in the Xbox One and PS4, respectively.

As a result, the EESC unit grew as its CPU and GPU businesses faded. But as investors saw during the first quarter, growth in the EESC unit is also slowing down:

Average selling prices fell across the board. As a result, the computing and graphics unit posted an operating loss of $75 million, down from a profit of $3 million a year earlier. Operating income at EESC plunged 47% year-over-year to $45 million.
Qualcomm: an existential crisisQualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of mobile SoCs and wireless modems in the world. That puts it in a solid position to profit from the growth of the smartphone industry, but it also has a glaring weakness: Qualcomm depends on Apple and Samsung for roughly half of its revenue.
In the past, Qualcomm provided the wireless modem for Apple iPhones, and SoCs and wireless modems for Samsung flagship Galaxy devices. But both companies are now moving to cut Qualcomm silicon out of their handsets. Apple will reportedly use its own wireless modem or an Intel one in a variant of its next iPhone. Samsung replaced Qualcomm Snapdragon processors with its own Exynos SoC in its latest S6 handsets and installed its own Shannon wireless modem. 
Samsung has its own chipmaking business which is also a threat to Qualcomm. Samsung, Apple, and Qualcomm all license mobile chip designs from ARM Holdings. But unlike either company, Samsung has a foundry which accepts manufacturing contracts from other OEMs. Apple, for example, recently contracted Samsung to manufacture its upcoming A9 chips. Meanwhile, the Samsung Exynos processor has found its way into other smartphones from Meizu and ZTE, which both also use Qualcomm chips.

In response, Qualcomm shifted its focus toward emerging markets with ""turnkey"" solutions for smaller OEMs. These package deals let OEMs bundle Qualcomm hardware and software together, which reduces the development and manufacturing costs of new phones. However, the pricing power that came with that strategy was considered anticompetitive in China, which resulted in a $975 million fine last year. That fine caused net income to plunge 46% year-over-year last quarter.
Qualcomm does not expect things to improve anytime soon. It recently slashed its full year revenue and earnings outlook, blaming Apple and Samsung for those adjustments.

The winner: QualcommIt is tough to pick between two losers, but Qualcomm is a safer bad news buy for three reasons.
First, Qualcomm is still profitable. The fine in China took a bite out of its GAAP earnings, but excluding that charge, its non-GAAP net income rose 4% annually last quarter. AMD was not profitable on any basis last quarter. Second, Qualcomm stock is relatively cheap at 14 times earnings, compared to the S&P 500 average price-to-earnings of 21 times and the industry trailing average of 48 times. 
Third, Qualcomm could bounce back if it diversifies its top line away from Apple and Samsung. Moreover, the commoditization of the smartphone market -- which harms those leading players -- is a positive development for Qualcomm, since it means smaller OEMs will require turnkey solutions. AMD, however, does not have an easy way to diversify away from its core businesses. Lastly, Qualcomm pays a respectable 2.9% dividend and has raised it for 11 straight years. There is little chance AMD will ever pay a dividend.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently reported its first quarter earnings, and they were ugly. The PC segment continued to collapse, with revenue from CPUs and GPUs falling by 38% year-over-year. The Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment, which includes AMD's game console business, shrunk as well, with revenue falling by 7% and operating profit nearly cut in half.
AMD doesn't expect things to get better anytime soon. The company has guided for a 3% sequential decline in total revenue during the second quarter, equivalent to a 30% year-over-year decline. The second half of this year may prove to be a bit better for AMD, with new graphics cards expected to launch in June, but big revenue declines are still likely, as are continued losses.
With AMD burning cash as it attempts to turn around its business, how long does the company have before bankruptcy becomes a real possibility?
A painful decline AMD still had about $900 million in cash and investments at the end of the first quarter, and the company has done a good job at maintaining a sizable cash balance despite its poor results. AMD has taken a few steps over the past few years to prevent its cash balance from falling too low. In 2013, the company sold its campus in Austin, Texas and leased it back, raising about $164 million in the process.
AMD has also slashed its capital expenditures, spending just $95 million in 2014 compared to $250 million in 2011. It's difficult to say for sure, but AMD may be underspending on capex in an effort to conserve cash, given that the company's depreciation expense was twice its capital expenditures in 2014. While this helps the situation in the short-term, it's unlikely to be sustainable in the long-run.
Here's how some key balance sheet figures have changed from 2010 to 2014:

All values in millions USD
AMD has managed to avoid taking on additional debt, and in fact has reduced its debt slightly over the past five years. But the book value of the company has plummeted, and after the first quarter, AMD is on the cusp of having a negative book value.
The balance sheet may not look all that concerning, given the big cash balance and the steady levels of debt, but things have actually gotten quite a bit worse over the past five years. The Altman Z-Score, a number calculated from various items on a company's balance sheet, is a useful way to determine whether a company is at risk of going bankrupt. A Z-Score below 1.81 means that the company is likely headed toward bankruptcy within the next few years.
Here's how AMD's Z-Score has evolved from 2010 to 2014:

Author's calculations. Data from AMD financial reports
In 2010, AMD's Z-Score indicated that it was distressed, but barely so. Since then, the Z-Score has plummeted, turning negative in 2014. The Altman Z-Score is a far from perfect metric, but it does help show that AMD's balance sheet has truly deteriorated over the past five years.
A few years left Despite the bleakness of AMD's balance sheet, the good news is that AMD has until 2019 before it has to repay any significant portion of its outstanding debt, with $600 million worth of notes maturing that year. This buys AMD some time to turn things around before it needs to refinance that debt.
The problem is that the deterioration of AMD's business doesn't seem to be slowing down. First quarter results were awful by any measure, much worse compared to the first quarter of 2014, and the second quarter won't be any better.
Delays are starting to plague the company, not surprising given that research and development spending has been slashed continually over the past few years. AMD's 64-bit ARM server chips, supposed to be the savior of AMD's languishing server business, have been pushed back to the second half of this year, one year later than initially planned. Meanwhile, AMD's upcoming discrete graphics cards are now expected sometime in June. Competitor NVIDIA has had the high-end of the market essentially to itself since last September when it launched the GTX 970 and 980, and AMD has yet to respond with anything at all.
There's no real threat that AMD goes bankrupt in the next few years -- the company has plenty of cash remaining and no major debt repayments coming up. But that cash balance will continue to dwindle as AMD tries to remain competitive in too many markets with too few resources, battling Intel and NVIDIA simultaneously. By the time 2019 rolls around, AMD's financial position will likely be even more precarious than it is today. If the company hasn't come up with some sort of strategy to return to profitability by then, bankruptcy will become very likely, if not inevitable.

            ","Following struggling chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) weak earnings and forward guidance, Barron's reported that Jeffries analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated the stock as a ""Buy"" and maintained his $4 price target, representing a nearly 40% upside from current levels.
Lipacis argued that AMD has ""great [intellectual property],"" citing x86, ARM, graphics, and server-fabric technologies as examples of such ""great"" intellectual property. He also reportedly says that AMD just needs a ""plan to monetize it.""
To be perfectly blunt, I disagree on the value of this IP. Here is why.
If the IP is so valuable, why are AMD products losing market share? The simple question that investors should ask about this allegedly ""valuable IP"": If the IP is so valuable, why do AMD products continue to lose market share?
It is well-known that AMD x86 processors are simply outclassed by the competition. Intel processors are known to offer both higher performance and more power efficiency than comparable AMD offerings. This is likely one of the main reasons that Intel keeps on taking substantial market share from AMD in x86 processors.
In graphics processors, it is the same old story -- NVIDIA products deliver better performance-per-watt than their AMD counterparts, which has helped the former gain significant market share, particularly in gaming notebooks.
AMD is still developing products based on its internally designed ARM core, so it is hard to make any assessment of the relative worth of this particular piece of intellectual property.
Finally, the same question needs to be asked about AMD server fabric technology: if it is so great, why isn't AMD out making money with it? I believe the fabric in question actually came to AMD as part of its acquisition of SeaMicro -- you know, the acquisition that AMD just took a writedown on and shuttered.
Another reason AMD IP might not be worth all that much The big growth markets for CPUs and graphics -- the IP that some assert is so valuable -- are the low-power and mobile markets as well as the networking and server markets.
In mobile, ARM has a whole suite of CPUs, graphics cores, and video processors. This IP is also quite good, which is why it is so broadly adopted.
Imagination also licenses CPU cores (MIPS) and graphics/media (PowerVR). Its graphics IP is also known to be top-notch -- the company reports that it is seeing ""record royalties"" for its MIPS CPU cores, implying that this IP is competitive. 
It is just hard to see a lot of value in the AMD IP portfolio given how rich the current semiconductor intellectual property landscape is. 
The best way for AMD to ""monetize"" its IP I do not think that IP makes AMD valuable enough as an acquisition target given that good IP can be licensed for cheap. The best way for AMD to ""monetize"" this portfolio is to make competitive chips based on said IP.
The fact that AMD is losing market share in both PC processors and graphics, and has essentially no presence in servers, tells me everything I need to know about the true value of its current IP portfolio.

            ","Back in February 2012, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announced that it would acquire microserver vendor SeaMicro to ""accelerate"" its ""disruptive server strategy."" The company paid a whopping $334 million for the company, with $281 million of that paid in cash.
Just three years later, AMD announced during its first quarter 2015 report that it would be pulling the proverbial plug on this venture and taking a $75 million writedown in the process. On the most recent earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su said that the micro-server market ""[has] not developed at the pace we might have thought a couple of years ago.""
Su also pointed out that AMD's ""core competency is really in processors and being able to service that business through either standard or semicustom products."" In other words, AMD -- a chip vendor -- thinks that it should just stick to selling chips.
What a terrible waste Perhaps the most frustrating part of this for AMD shareholders must be the fact that AMD paid $281 million in cold hard cash for this acquisition. It would be one thing if AMD were generating robust levels of cash year-in and year-out, but as you can see from the table below, AMD's cash flow situation since early 2012 has been pretty bad:

Source: YCharts
The worst part of this is that AMD has over $2 billion in debt to service, but only a little over $900 million in cash on hand. The company would have been better served plowing that $281 million in cash into paying off some of its relatively high interest debt.
Speaking of servers ... AMD's server processor share has plunged so much in recent years that it's a stretch to say that the company is even ""competing"" in this market right now. Aside from a few rebranded PC processors, as well as an ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH)based server chip that has perpetually been stuck in the ""sampling"" phase (to be fair, Su says that this chip -- known as Seattle -- should generate revenue in the second half of this year), AMD hasn't released new chips aimed at the server market in years.
AMD CEO Lisa Su talked about how the company is investing in developing new server chips in a bid to regain share, but I'm very skeptical that the company can even succeed at this point. AMD's larger rival, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), has said that it spends $2 billion per year in data center related research and development.
That's more than twice AMD's yearly research and development budget.
In addition, Intel has a strong base of products, architectures, and customer relationships from which to build off of; AMD not only needs to use its much smaller research and development budget to make up for lost time, but it then needs to be able to consistently invest so that its products remain competitive year in, year out.
This doesn't seem realistic to me.
It'll be interesting to see what AMD has to say in May AMD made sure to let investors know that it will be hosting a financial analyst day on May 6. I am very interested to see what AMD's long-term strategy with respect to the server market. In particular, I'm interested in seeing what particular segments of the overall server market AMD will focus on, and what sort of financials the company expects in the medium and long term.

            ","Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were down 14.1% as of 10:48 a.m. Friday after the company announced disappointing first-quarter results.
So what: Quarterly revenue fell 26% year over year to $1.03 billion, which translated to an adjusted net loss of $73 million, or $0.09 per share. Analysts, on average, were looking for a much narrower loss of $0.05 per share on higher revenue of $1.05 billion.
Even so, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said: ""Building great products, driving deeper customer relationships and simplifying our business remain the right long-term steps to strengthen AMD and improve our financial performance.""
Now what: For now, Su elaborated, that means focusing ""on improving our near-term financial results and delivering a stronger second half of the year based on completing our work to rebalance channel inventories and shipping strong new products.""
For the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to decrease 3% sequentially, plus or minus 3% -- or a range of roughly $0.97 billion to $1.03 billion. Analysts were modeling sequential quarterly growth in revenue of 9.7% to $1.13 billion.
In the end, it's hard to blame the market for bidding shares of AMD down today given both its modest quarterly miss and lighter-than-expected guidance. Until AMD can show some tangible progress toward achieving its goal of sustained profitability -- which starts with improved financial results in the second half of the year -- I fear long investors will likely endure more pain going forward.

            ","Fellow Fool Leo Sun recently published a write-up discussing why chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is not actively targeting the market for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chromebooks. Leo pointed to a quote from an AMD executive, who reportedly said that Chromebooks are a ""rock-bottom market"" with unattractive margins.
This might be true for AMD, but in my view, it has very little to do with anything inherent to the Chromebook market itself. AMD's apparent inability to compete for good margins in the Chromebook market seems to be a company-specific problem. Allow me to explain.
Intel is making bank from Chromebooks at good margins Over the past several years, AMD's gross profit margins have plunged. In the last 12 months, the gross profit margin percentage came out to just 33.4%, down from the low 40% range the company had enjoyed in years past. This performance stands in stark contrast to rival Intel(NASDAQ:INTC), which has seen gross profit margins of over 63% during the same period. 
Although one could rightfully attribute those very high gross profit margins to its data-center chips, note that last year, the Intel PC Client Group recorded an operating margin of over 42%. That means gross profit margins for that division, since Intel spends heavily on research and development, were significantly above that level.
Yet Intel sells lots of chips into Chromebooks and Chromebook-class laptops.
Low-cost does not always mean low-margin There is a fundamental concept that investors need to understand: Low prices do not necessarily mean low margins. The gross profit margin percentage does not just depend on the selling prices of its products but the costs to manufacture those products as well.
For example, if I sell a chip for $1.00, but it costs me just $0.30 to manufacture it, then my gross profit margin percentage on that chip is a very respectable 70%. Conversely, if I sell a chip for $1,000, but it costs me $750 to manufacture it, then my gross profit margin percentage on that chip is just 25%.
Where I think the confusion comes from is that low-cost chips, even with high per-chip gross profit margin percentages, do not generate as much in gross profit dollars per unit. However, that is why it is always important to factor volume into the equation to get a picture of the total gross profit.
With that out of the way, let's get back to AMD, Intel, and Chromebooks.
Intel margins on Chromebooks are quite high The chips that Intel typically sells into Chromebooks are either very feature-reduced Core processors sold under the ""Pentium"" and ""Celeron"" brands, or they are Atom-derived chips sold under those same brands.
Now, Intel has said that the majority of its Pentium and Celeron chips have been moved to the Atom architecture, because this lowers the company cost structure for said chips. Furthermore, Intel has indicated that over 20% of all of the chips it sells into laptop PCs are based on the Atom architecture.
So why is Intel able to make good money selling low-cost PC chips? 
It is about cost structure, and potentially competitiveness I believe the real reason AMD does not want to take Intel on in devices such as Chromebooks is that it simply does not have the cost structure to compete. Intel just announced that it is shipping low-cost, low-power chips known as Braswell for the low-cost PC market based on its 14-nanometer technology.
AMD's Carrizo-L, which is expected to compete with Braswell, is also expected to ship in the first half of 2015. However, there are a couple of things worth noting. Not only does AMD need to pay an external chip manufacturer to build its products (putting it at a disadvantage to Intel right off the bat), but AMD's chips also do not seem to target the same power envelope.
For some context, Carrizo-L, according to the AMD website, is targeted at a 10 to 25-watt power envelope. Braswell, on the other hand, targets a 6-watt ""thermal design power"" and a 4-watt ""scenario design power."" These chips are not even close to the same league in terms of power consumption.
That means low-cost Braswell chips can be used to power cheap, fanless Chromebooks. I am not convinced that the current AMD product lineup is well suited to address this opportunity.

            ","AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) cheap x86 microprocessors seem like a natural match for Chromebooks, the low-end laptops tethered to Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cloud-based ecosystem. 
Yet AMD isn't interested in developing chips for Chromebooks, according to CTO Mark Papermaster, who called Chromebooks a ""rock-bottom"" market at the ISSCC conference in February. Is shunning Chromebooks that the right strategy for AMD, or is it missing out on a lucrative growth market?

Chromebooks. Source: Google
The business of ChromebooksIDC estimates that Global sales of Chromebooks roughly doubled to 4.6 million shipments in 2014, but only accounted for 1.5% of the PC market.
However, Gartner believes that annual Chromebook sales will soar to 14.2 million units by 2017, accounting for 4.3% of the PC market. By comparison, Gartner expects annual shipments of all PCs, including Chromebooks, to only rise 4.3% to 327.3 million units between 2014 and 2017. Based on those numbers, establishing a toehold in Chromebooks might help AMD offset sluggish PC sales.
Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Celeron chips power roughly three-fourths of all Chromebooks, according to Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron. The remainder runs on ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) licensed designs. This duopoly means that AMD would need to undercut both Intel and ARM licensees to enter the Chromebook market -- which could be rough on margins.
Are AMD's chips too powerful?The problem with Chromebooks is that they're designed for light usage, such as Web browsing, office work, and video streaming. These tasks don't require a lot of graphical horsepower.
AMD, which acquired graphics card maker ATI in 2006, specializes in APUs which combine the CPU's processing power with the GPU's graphical muscle. Carrizo, its upcoming notebook SoC, pairs four x86 CPU cores with eight GPU cores -- which is arguably more power than any Chrome OS user would ever need. 
Yet AMD's Mullins, the low-power APU that it introduced last year, seems like a good fit for Chromebooks. The chip, originally intended for tablets, was installed in cheap Windows laptops like Hewlett-Packard's $230 Stream 14 last year.
Why margins matterIt seems odd that AMD didn't pit Mullins against the Celeron in the Chromebook market, but the margins, as Papermaster suggested, probably aren't worth the effort.
AMD is still on the path set by former CEO Rory Read, who shifted the company toward higher-margin businesses, like the embedded, server, and semicustom unit, which sells SoCs for Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. That strategy helped AMD grow its top line, reduce operating expenses, and narrow its non-GAAP losses.
Part of that strategy, which current CEO Lisa Su is continuing, is to avoid head-on battles against Intel. Intel has much more cash to spend on marketing, and isn't shy about taking losses to gain or retain market share. For example, Intel's mobile unit posted an operating loss of $4.2 billion due to its aggressive subsidization of tablet and smartphone makers. With Chromebooks, Intel sells low-margin Celerons to prevent ARM licensees from gaining ground in the PC market.
Will the Chromebook Pixel change AMD's mind?Chromebooks don't require much GPU power, but future models might. Last month, Google unveiled the second-generation Chromebook Pixel, a high-end Chromebook that starts at $999. The device sports a 2.6 Ghz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. For graphics, the Pixel uses Intel HD Graphics 5500, an integrated graphics card which can play most modern PC games on low graphics settings.

There's not much of a market now for the Pixel, since Chrome apps don't demand much CPU or GPU performance. However, Google is making select Android apps compatible with Chrome OS, which means that graphically demanding Android games could be natively played on Chromebooks soon. That cross-platform compatibility might encourage other OEMs to manufacture high-end Chromebooks with beefier GPUs, which would be a more favorable market for Carrizo.
The bottom lineAMD's distaste for the Chromebook market makes sense, because it doesn't want to ruin its margins competing against Intel and ARM in a ""rock bottom"" market. But if the Chromebook market continues growing and evolves toward higher-end devices like the Pixel, an opportunity for APUs like Carrizo might emerge.

Below are five of the biggest -- in some cases in terms of dollars spent, in others, in terms of their significance. Whether it was a larger firm absorbing a start-up that later defined its business, or a tech giant absorbing an established rival, these acquisitions have all helped to define the current tech landscape.
Google buys AndroidGoogle (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has made many prescient acquisitions over the years -- YouTube in 2006, Applied Semantics in 2003 -- but its acquisition of Android may have been the most significant. When Google purchased Android back in 2005, few people had ever heard of Andy Rubin's start-up. In terms of a raw dollar figure, the deal was rather insignificant (an estimated $50 million), but the resulting effects have been so notable (a Google executive later termed it ""its best deal ever"") that the purchase deserves its place on this list.
Today, Android is one of the largest operating systems in the world, with around 1 billion active users, and a dominant share of the mobile market -- the overwhelming majority of smartphones and tablets sold worldwide run Google's operating system.
Google doesn't profit from Android directly (it gives it away for free) but Android serves as a tapestry for Google's services, allowing it to push its products like Maps, search, and Gmail onto its many mobile users.
Apple acquires Steve Jobs' NeXTLike Google's purchase of Android, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquisition of NeXT in late 1996 wasn't the largest in terms of dollars -- it cost just $400 million. But if it hadn't happened, Apple probably wouldn't be in business today, let alone be the world's largest company.
The purchase of NeXT brought Steve Jobs back to Apple, and set the stage for the company's resurgence. Technologies developed at NeXT form the backbone of what are arguably Apple's two most important products: its operating systems. Both OS X (Mac) and iOS (iPhone, iPad) were built on technologies developed at NeXT, and Apple's exclusive use of these operating systems sets its products apart from competitors.
AMD gets into graphics with ATIBoth Android and NeXT are, in hindsight, wildly successful acquisitions. The success of semiconductor giant AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) 2006 purchase of graphics maker ATI, however, is a bit less clear.
For $5.4 billion, AMD entered the graphics market, buying what was then one of the top dedicated graphics card designers. At the time, AMD was coming off one of its most successful quarters ever (in terms of processor market share) and executives argued that the combination would allow the company to take even market share from Intel, as it could court PC OEMs with a combination of AMD processors and ATI graphics chips.
It's not clear if the merger was a significant contributor, but AMD's business has definitely gone downhill since acquisition, and its current market cap (about $2 billion) is less than half of what it paid for ATI. In the graphics card market, Nvidia has surged ahead of AMD, while Intel completely dominates the PC processor market.
Hewlett-Packard merges with CompaqHewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) $25 billion purchase of rival PC-maker Compaq is, like AMD's purchase of ATI, fairly controversial.
The purchase did create a PC behemoth -- Hewlett-Packard is, to this day, one of the largest PC vendors in the world. But it may have tarnished Hewlett-Packard's culture and focus. Shareholders have certainly suffered. Since it announced the acquisition in September, 2001, Hewlett-Packard shares are up around 103% on a total return basis. The S&P 500, however, is up more than 138%.

^SPXTR data by YCharts
To be fair, other tech behemoths -- including both Microsoft and IBM -- have done even worse for their shareholders (returning about 102% and 91%, respectively) but Hewlett-Packard has largely wallowed in mediocrity since the acquisition, going through a string of CEOs and several failed attempts at transformation -- a sharp contrast to its massive success in the 1990s.
The merger is even more interesting considering the fact that it was opposed by board member Walter Hewlett, son of Bill Hewlett, the co-founder of the company. Hewlett led a proxy battle in an attempt to block the merger, but was ultimately unsuccessful.
AOL buys Time WarnerThe merger of AOL (NYSE:AOL) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) was one of the largest in history. In total, AOL spent about $162 billion to acquire the media giant, creating a corporate colossus that was supposed to -- at least in theory -- dominate the Internet. With Time Warner's networks and cable assets, and AOL's Internet service, the mashup appeared to hold great potential. The combined company may have been able to dictate the flow of media and advertising in the United States.
Unfortunately, it is widely regarded as a disaster. In 2009, it came to an end, with Time Warner spinning AOL off. It also divested its cable company (Time Warner Cable) and later, its magazine publishing arm, Time, Inc. Although the share price of all the firms has rallied since the split, the market cap of all four firms combined (around $120 billion) remains a far cry from AOL-Time Warner's once enormous $350 billion valuation.

            ","Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) must ""face claims that it committed securities fraud"" in ""hiding problems"" with the launch of a chip code-named Llano, according to Reuters. 
AMD reportedly told investors it would deliver ample supply of Llano chips beginning in the second quarter of 2011. The reality, according to Reuters, was that the company faced supply constraints. To make matters worse, by the time AMD worked through its production issues, demand for those chips had dried up. This is a fast-moving sector, after all.
Then, in an earnings warning in October 2012, AMD said it would take a writedown on $100 million worth of Llano inventory that it simply couldn't move. Reuters reported that, as a result of this alleged deception, the plaintiffs seek damages for investors who purchased AMD stock ""between April 2011 and October 2012.""
The huge fall in AMD's share price According to Reuters, the plaintiffs allege that AMD's stock fell by 74% from March 2012 to October 2012 due to the market learning about the severity of the Llano supply situation.
While the $100 million inventory writedown unquestionably cost shareholders, I'm not at all convinced the stock-price drop from $8.35 to $2.18 had much, if anything, to do with the Llano situation.
Let's dig a little bit deeper, shall we?
AMD in 2012 Here's a chart of AMD's stock price during 2012:

Source: Google Finance.
Notice how things were going pretty well until the shares started sliding around late March/early April? Well, during this time, AMD likely didn't face supply constraints on Llano, and by April 2012 it had even begun shipping Llano's follow-on, known as Trinity.
In my view, the biggest problem facing the company in 2012 was a weakening PC market: Both AMD and larger rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported declines in their respective PC-related revenue for the year.
In July 2012, AMD pre-announced that revenue for the second quarter of the year would be down 11% sequentially. The previous forecast had been for a 3% decline.
Then, when AMD finally reported results for the second quarter, the company said it expected revenue to ""decrease 1% sequentially +/- 3%."" That was not so great (the second half of the year is supposed to be seasonally up), but things got worse when AMD negatively pre-announced again.
During that pre-announcement, AMD said revenue would drop 10% sequentially, instead of just 1%. The chipmaker also said it would take the $100 million inventory writedown related to the Llano chips.
The writedown wasn't why AMD stock plunged Whether AMD shaded the truth regarding the Llano supply situation or not, I think, has little to do with the painful share price decline in 2012. AMD's shares had already taken a beating well before management announced the writedown.
I believe the share price declines both before the writedown and after were due to a much weaker than expected PC market, coupled with very aggressive competition from Intel as it fought to stabilize its own PC chip shipments in a tough market.
Finally, for a more visual illustration of why the inventory writedown was hardly a major driver of AMD's stock loss, look at the following chart:

Source: Google Finance.
Intel, which derives most of its revenue and profits from PC chip sales, experienced a very similar trend in its share price during 2012. Now, the decline wasn't as steep (AMD is a far more volatile stock, and that volatility cuts both ways) but the directions were roughly the same.

            ","A little while ago, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) made it clear to the industry that it wanted to monetize its graphics patent war chest. This has led some to suggest that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), the other major vendor of high-performance standalone graphics, could potentially follow suit.
Indeed, on Twitter, Justin Jaynes made a very interesting point in response to my claim that Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) could simply poach graphics talent rather than buy the entire company -- he said that while Samsung could poach engineers, it cannot poach patents.
To that end, I decided to do some digging to try to get a sense of the relative value of AMD's graphics patent portfolio relative to that of other players in the industry.
Here is what NVIDIA says At an investor presentation this year, NVIDIA shared the following slide:

Source: NVIDIA
NVIDIA claims that it has over 600 ""fundamental graphics patents"" while its peers tend to have far fewer. Interestingly enough, it appears that if Samsung were to acquire AMD (as some have suggested), this would approximately double its ""fundamental graphics patent"" portfolio. Still smaller than NVIDIA, but this might, as has been suggested, help it better defend against NVIDIA's patent lawsuit.
What would Samsung have to pay if it wanted those patents? If Samsung were to outright buy AMD today for, say, a 50% premium to the current market capitalization, this would imply a purchase price of $3 billion. After factoring in the net debt position, Samsung would wind up paying a tad over $4 billion.
In that case, would it make financial sense for Samsung to pick up AMD just for its graphics patents?
Licensing NVIDIA patents might be cheaper You might recall that Intel wound up paying NVIDIA $1.5 billion over the course of six years as part of what is essentially a cross-licensing agreement (to read more about the Intel-NVIDIA deal, I recommend checking out the AnandTech article here).
At any rate, the deal between NVIDIA and Intel seemed to essentially boil down to Intel needing access to NVIDIA graphics patents in order to continue to build its own graphics processors into its PC chips.
My guess is that if Samsung has to, it could simply license NVIDIA's patent portfolio for significantly less than it would need to pay to buy AMD. Intel is paying NVIDIA $264 million per year in a deal worth $1.5 billion. Even if Samsung had to pay NVIDIA the same annual rate, it makes sense to just license the patents.
It will be interesting to see how the NVIDIA-Samsung situation plays out This whole discussion has come about because NVIDIA recently sued Samsung, claiming that the chips Samsung includes in its phones (which usually have Qualcomm or ARM designed graphics processors) infringe upon NVIDIA's fundamental patents.
As per the slide above, NVIDIA says the ITC hearing with respect to this case will happen in late June and that a decision is set to come in early October. I am very interested to see how this all plays out and what NVIDIA's patent portfolio is deemed to be ""worth."" Not only is this interesting to NVIDIA shareholders, it could help establish the value of AMD's graphics-related patent portfolio as well.

            ","Over on Twitter, I came across the following ""tweet"": 
If anyone buys AMD it should be Apple not Samsung.
This sparked quite an interesting discussion between a lot of smart people, some of whom thought that an acquisition of AMD(NASDAQ:AMD) by Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL) would be a great idea, others not so much. 
I am firmly in the camp that believes Apple would get very little from acquiring AMD. Here is why. 
Not much AMD has to offer that Apple does not already haveAMD's main assets are its CPU core development teams, its graphics processor teams, and its system-on-chip integration teams, and I do not think that Apple really needs the full teams from AMD as it has organic efforts here. 
If that sounds familiar, that is because it is a very similar argument for why I believe Samsung will not acquire AMD. 
As far as CPUs go, Apple is all set. Its low-power CPU cores offer best-in-class performance -- Apple is ahead of Samsung here, actually, as the latter still uses stock ARM cores, and the company seems to be able to poach talent from any company that it would like. 
As far as graphics processors go, Apple has seemingly been hiring graphics talent for quite some time. If Apple really wanted to bring best-in-class graphics IP in-house quickly (rather than try to build it organically as it seems to be doing now), then the company could just buy Imagination Technologies for a fraction of what it would pay for AMD once its debt is factored into the equation. 
Finally, just as Samsung has its own system-on-chip integration teams, so does Apple, and they seem to do a solid job. I do not think having the integration teams in-house would be something Apple would be interested in. 
Does Apple want to sell PC chips and graphics processors?If Apple were to buy AMD, it would necessarily inherit all current business units and projects. AMD builds standalone graphics processors for notebooks and desktops, PC chips that it sells to PC vendors, and it is even working on a number of projects in embedded, servers, and semi-custom. 
I do not believe Apple wants to be in the business of selling chips into all of these markets. While some might argue that Apple could use AMD processors to power its Macs, keep in mind that its PC chips are currently not competitive. Apple would likely need to invest significantly in the acquired AMD asset to bulk up the performance of future AMD products just to make them usable in the Macs. 
And, even then, there is still no guarantee that these chips would wind up competitive enough to boot Intel. 
An Apple buyout of AMD seems like a pipe-dream The idea that Apple will buy AMD seems highly implausible, just like the rumored buyout of AMD by Samsung. I disagree with the author of the tweet mentioned above and think that an Apple/AMD hookup makes even less sense than a Samsung/AMD hookup. 
Samsung, at the very least, would be more likely to try to make AMD's PC processor business viable since it has expressed interest in selling its Exynos processors to other phone/tablet vendors.
Apple, on the other hand, designs chips for its own use -- it is not a merchant chip company nor does it have any ambitions to be one. Picking up a company like AMD just to service its internal chip needs, particularly when Apple already has strong in-house capabilities that it can continue to build organically, just does not make sense.

            ","There has been quite a lot of talk these days about Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) potentially acquiring struggling chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Although such a deal might make sense on the surface, the case for it weakens significantly upon deeper analysis.
The potential rationale for this dealAMD is not all that well, and the company has struggled to generate positive free cash flow for two years. This is not surprising given that its market share in both PC processors as well as stand-alone graphics processors both continue to weaken.
A significant part of the problem looks to be, as has been widely noted at this point, that as AMD revenues weaken, the company has had to cut research and development spending in order to stay afloat. As it does this, its product pipeline also weakens, making it more difficult to compete in future product cycles. This leads to a vicious cycle of even more research and development cuts.
On the other hand, Samsung is flush with cash and generates substantial cash flow year-in and year-out. The popular idea, then, is that Samsung could acquire AMD and give it the necessary funding to be more competitive in its end markets. This, according to some, could potentially lead to revenue growth for AMD and a solid return for Samsung on the acquisition.
Does AMD really bring much to the table?  The first problem with such a deal is that AMD does not offer much to Samsung that it cannot build organically (or acquire more cheaply). AMD's core assets, in my view, are its CPU cores and development teams, its graphics cores and development teams, and its system-on-chip integration teams.
Samsung has already said that it is designing its own CPU cores, and if it wants AMD's talent, it can simply poach it (as it and many other companies have already done). The same argument applies to graphics processors. Samsung also very clearly has its own system-on-chip integration teams, so there is not much value-add for Samsung there, either.
What about x86? A point that AMD bulls will make is that AMD has an x86 license, which allows it to compete in the Windows PC market. This is true, but Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a very established player in the PC processor market, and my view is that its PC-related product pipeline is much stronger than AMD's by virtue of the substantial research and development investments that it has made there.
Now, AMD bulls will say that with Samsung's support, the company could bulk up its x86 processor portfolio and make it a viable competitor in PCs and even servers. That sounds nice in theory, but I think that in order to give the AMD product portfolio a fighting chance, it would need to substantially increase its investments.
Even if Samsung were to bring its investments in x86 chips up to the level of what Intel spends, it would take time for those improvements to actually show up in products.
Then, even if Samsung could significantly improve AMD's x86 design pipeline, it seems unlikely that it would be able to compensate for the manufacturing disadvantage that Samsung has relative to Intel.
Being a fab is a better idea Although Samsung does design its own processors for its own use, it has made it clear that it wants to attract a broad range of foundry customers. Why should it buy AMD and spend lots of money and effort trying to compete with Intel in PCs, when it could profit from building chips for a lot of semiconductor companies?
Between building out its foundry business and building its own Exynos chips for mobile devices, it is hard to see a situation where Samsung wins big with an AMD acquisition. And frankly, if Samsung were interested in AMD, I think it would have acquired it already.

The technology industry has done quite well lately, carrying the Nasdaq Composite back up to the 5,000 mark for the first time since the turn of the millennium. Yet even though many tech stocks have performed well lately, some are facing major challenges that might make some investors reluctant to commit their hard-earned capital.
In order to pinpoint a couple of troubling tech stocks and a solid alternative to recommend, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to give their thoughts on some well-known companies in the technology sector. Look at what they have to say and see what you think about both their bullish and bearish views on these companies.
Tim Green (Advanced Micro Devices): It may seem tempting to buy shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in the hopes of a turnaround, but it's one stock that I'd stay away from. The company's core PC business, which includes PC processors and graphics cards, has been unraveling for the past few years, and its attempts to diversify away from the PC has spread the company's limited resources too thin.
Source: AMD.
Despite high-profile new product launches in recent years, AMD has been bleeding market share to both Intel in the CPU market and NVIDIA in the GPU market. A few years ago, AMD shipped about 40% of all discrete graphics cards; today, this percentage has fallen to just 24% as NVIDIA has consolidated its lead. AMD plans to launch new graphics cards later this year, but the most recent refresh of its product line didn't help in terms of market share at all.
AMD has managed to stay afloat thanks to its deals to provide the processors for the major game consoles, and the company is actively trying to strike additional semi-custom design deals. But any profits from this segment have been largely wiped out by losses in the PC segment and significant interest payments on the company's debt. With any future semi-custom deals unlikely to be anywhere near as big as the game console deals, meaningfully growing the segment will be difficult.
AMD is a company that's trying to compete in too many markets: PC CPUs, GPUs, server CPUs, semi-custom CPUs, and embedded CPUs. Intel spends more than ten times as much on research and development compared to AMD, and even NVIDIA now outspends the company on that front. AMD needs to narrow its focus, and until that happens I can't recommend the stock.
Dan Caplinger (Nokia): One stock I would avoid currently is Nokia (NYSE:NOK), which is only a shell of itself after having sold off its mobile device and services division to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year. It's true that the sale helped Nokia rid itself of what had become an unsuccessful business, as the mobile phone pioneer had failed to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation in the sector and was under threat from more aggressive smartphone makers around the world. What's left is a trio of businesses, with its networking products producing the bulk of Nokia's remaining revenue.
The big issue facing Nokia is whether it can successfully make the transition in an increasingly competitive networking environment. Opportunities abound for growth, especially in the lucrative U.S. market. But the possibility of a dividend cut looms large over Nokia, and even with the stock at relatively reasonable valuations, any reduction in its dividend payout could send the share price tumbling. Nokia will need to demonstrate its ability to tap into important trends like the 5G upgrade cycle while keeping its margins as high as possible. In the long run, Nokia could very well end up on top, but right now, I'd prefer to see how the competition lines up before making bets on the sector.
Bob Ciura (Microsoft): Microsoft is a tech stock investors should buy, because it provides a great combination of growth, value, and dividends, meaning the stock has something to offer virtually all investor types.
Microsoft's two core operating segments, commercial and consumer, both grew revenue last quarter. Devices and consumer revenue grew 8% to $12.9 billion due to several factors. Microsoft sold 10.5 million Lumia units last quarter, leading to $2.3 billion in phone hardware revenue. Surface revenue grew 24%, driven by the success of the Surface Pro 3. Office 365 Home and Personal subscribers jumped 30% to over 9.2 million. Even Bing contributed positively as search advertising revenue rose 23%.
Microsoft's other big business is doing well too. Commercial revenue increased 5% to $13.3 billion thanks squarely to Microsoft's booming enterprise cloud business. Commercial cloud revenue soared 114%, thanks to Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online, and eclipsed a $5.5 billion annualized revenue run-rate. And revenue from server products and services grew 9%.
In all, Microsoft generated $9.9 billion of free cash flow in the first half of its current fiscal year. It paid $4.8 billion of dividends in the same period, which equates to a very comfortable 48% payout ratio. All this cash is piling up on the balance sheet. At the end of last quarter, the company held $90 billion in cash and marketable securities on the books with just a 20% long-term debt to equity ratio.
Microsoft produces huge free cash flow, returns a sizable chunk of it to investors through its 3% dividend, and trades for just 16 times earnings. For all these qualities, Microsoft is a buy.

In previous articles, I highlighted strengths and weaknesses for the company. Today, I want to take a look at five recent statements from the management team and what they could mean for shareholders.
1. It expects the PC business to grow againDuring the fourth quarter earnings call, CEO Lisa Su stated that the PC market will stabilize with low single-digit percentage declines in 2015. Su claimed AMD had ""right-sized"" its investments in the space and had reduced its downstream channel inventory in the fourth quarter.
Su stated, ""We will continue these corrective actions into the first quarter to aim for a return to growth starting in the second quarter."" According to Su, that growth can be accomplished by a reduction in inventory and the upcoming launch of its Carrizo SoCs,
However, investors should recall that revenue at the Computing and Graphics segment slipped 16% year-over-year in 2014, primarily due to lower desktop processor and chipset sales. Meanwhile, Carrizo SoCs are still 28 nanometer chips, which could have trouble competing against fanless Intel 14 nanometer Broadwell chips in ultra-thin notebooks and 2-in-1 devices.
2. Consoles matter more than PCsSu also stated that AMD will increase its R&D investments in the EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) business, which generated 43% of revenue last year.
Annual EESC revenue and operating income rose 51% and 35%, respectively, thanks to robust sales of the Sony PS4 and Microsoft Xbox One, which both run on AMD SoCs. According to Su:
Nearly 30 million Sony and Microsoft consoles have now shipped. Our semi-custom shipments more than doubled in 2014, which fueled excellent full-year performance for this part of our business.
3. Supporting ARM-based serversSince AMD has been marginalized by Intel in servers, it is boosting support for ARM-licensed designs in the EESC business. In regards to supporting ARM's interest in servers, Su stated:
Our work to lead the industry's transition to 64-bit ARM also gained momentum in the quarter. We have secured multiple design wins for our upcoming Opteron A series, and the first systems are expected to launch later this year.
For AMD, the 64-bit Opteron A1100, unveiled last January, is its first ARM-based CPU. The chip is specifically designed for microservers -- a new class of small, low-powered servers which are designated single tasks. 
When companies purchase microservers in clusters, they only purchase the computing power they need. By comparison, a company that purchases a powerful Xeon-powered server might overpay for unused computing power. IDC expects microservers to account for over 10% of the server market by 2016, which could bode well for Opteron-powered microservers.
4. Opportunities for growth in GPUsAMD has been aggressively trying to undercut NVIDIA in high-end graphics cards for years. However, investors should remember that most of the GPU market is comprised of integrated graphics chips like AMD APUs, Intel HD Graphics, and NVIDIA Project Denver.
Within this market, Intel is the clear market leader, with 71.4% of the market, while NVIDIA and AMD control 15% and 13.6%, respectively, according to research firm JPR. But for Su, AMD made progress in this market during the fourth quarter of 2014:
Mobile APU unit shipments, ASPs, and revenue all increased sequentially as our higher-end A8 and A10 APU shipments increased. We also achieved strong double-digit percentage revenue growth for notebook GPUs in the quarter as strategic wins like Apple's iMac with retina 5K display began to ramp.
This split between high-end and low-end GPUs was apparent in the fourth quarter earnings report, which stated that the prices of its GPUs rose sequentially because of higher desktop and notebook GPU average selling prices (ASP) but still declined year-over-year because of a lower channel ASP.
5. A $2 billion market opportunityInvestors should also remember that embedded devices powered by x86 and ARM processors -- which still account for a small part of EESC revenues -- could become more important to the top line. AMD embedded chips are currently used in a wide range of non-PC applications, such as industrial control, automation, and digital gaming.
Speaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in early March, SVP and CFO Devinder Kumar said, ""The available market in that area is about $9 billion. Our target market is $2 billion."" Although Kumar was vague, it means AMD could further distance itself from Intel and NVIDIA and wander into Freescale Semiconductor and Texas Instruments territory instead.
The key takeawaysIn a nutshell, AMD plans to reduce its exposure to consumer PCs, expand its EESC business, and realign its channel sales accordingly. While that sounds like a solid game plan, investors should recall that losses at its troubled Computing and Graphics division wiped out all bottom-line gains at its EESC business last year. If that keeps happening throughout 2015, I would not bet on AMD fixing itself anytime soon.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have fallen 20% over the past 12 months, as shares of top rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) respectively rose 36% and 24%. In previous articles, I discussed AMD's strengths and weaknesses. Today, we'll weigh them against each other to see if AMD is worth buying.

Source: Wikimedia Commons, Rayson Ho.
What AMD's valuations tell usSince AMD isn't profitable, it doesn't have a trailing P/E to compare against Intel and Nvidia. However, AMD is valued at 33 times forward earnings, assuming it can earn $0.09 per share in profit (as forecast by Thomson Reuters) by the end of 2016. By comparison, Intel and Nvidia respectively trade at 13 and 17 times forward earnings.
Over the past few years, former CEO Rory Read reduced AMD's operating expenses, maintained the company's cash at a constant level near $1 billion, and made sure no new debt comes due until 2019. Yet that thrifty strategy, combined with AMD's negative free cash flow of $193 million over the past 12 months, makes it tough for the company to mount any effective marketing blitzes against Intel and NVIDIA.
Potential catalystsAMD's greatest asset is its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment, which accounted for 43% of its top line last year. The business's revenue and operating income respectively rose 51% and 35% year over year in 2014, thanks to robust demand for Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4, which are both powered by AMD system on chips, or SoCs.
To date, 11.5 million Xbox Ones and 19.4 million PS4s have been sold, according to market tracking site VGChartz. Considering that Microsoft and Sony both previously sold about 85 million Xbox 360s and PS3s, AMD's console SoCs could keep contributing to its top line for years to come. Nintendo's next console will reportedly use an AMD SoC as well.

The segment also houses AMD's Opteron processors, which are used to power ""microservers."" Microservers are smaller, cheaper, and less powerful servers that usually only perform a single function, such as loading the background images on a webpage. Smaller companies prefer buying microservers in clusters, because it allows them to only buy the processing power they need. By comparison, big traditional servers -- powered mainly by Intel's Xeon processors -- are expensive ""jacks of all trades"" that are often too powerful for small-to-medium-sized businesses.
Microservers could account for over 10% of the entire server market by 2016, up from just 0.2% in 2011, according to IDC. AMD must compete with Intel's Atom and ARM-based CPUs in this market, but it's still a promising new way for the company to generate fresh revenue.
Potential pitfallsHowever, AMD's computing and graphics segment, which accounted for 57% of its top line last year, is faring much worse. The segment's revenue fell 16% year over year in 2014 as its operating loss widened from $91 million to $478 million. That loss completely erased the $399 million in operating income generated by the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business. The problem is that the segment is being crushed by Intel in x86 CPUs and by NVIDIA in high-end graphics cards, also known as AIBs (add-in boards).

Intel dominates the PC and server markets while selling pricier chips, which puts AMD in the unenviable position of selling fewer chips at cheaper prices. Meanwhile, Intel has its own foundry, which it uses to manufacture new 14-nanometer chips including the fanless Broadwell CPUs.
AMD's chips are manufactured by GlobalFoundries, which was spun off from AMD's manufacturing facilities. GlobalFoundries said it will only start manufacturing 14nm chips in the ""first half of 2015"". As a result, AMD's road map remains focused on its 28nm Carrizo chips, and it probably won't launch 14nm chips until 2016.
As for graphics cards, AMD has steadily fallen behind market leader NVIDIA. According to research firm JPR, AMD's global AIB market share fell from 35% to 24% between the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2014, while Nvidia's share rose from 65% to 76%.
AMD has been trying to undercut NVIDIA on pricing instead. Yet lowering the average selling price hasn't helped AMD gain much ground against its rival. In the fourth quarter of 2014, JPR reported that AMD's overall PC graphics shipments declined 7% year over year as NVIDIA's rose 2.9%. AMD finished the quarter with 13.6% share of the entire GPU market, compared to NVIDIA's 15%. Intel, with its integrated graphics chips, accounted for the remainder of the market.
The verdictIn the end, AMD's weaknesses offset its strengths. Its lack of profitability and inability to turn around its computing and graphics segment overshadow the notable strengths of its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business. A few wild cards -- such as the recent management shake-up and buyout possibilities -- might attract some contrarian investors, but AMD still has much to prove before it can be considered a stable investment.

            ","Over the past five years, shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD)have cratered over 60%. The company, once considered a major threat to the Intel x86 business, lost its way in CPUs, tried to diversify into graphics cards, and then suffered through subsequent pricing wars on both fronts.

In a previous article, I highlighted three key weaknesses at the company -- competitive pressure from Intel and Nvidia, technological inferiority to new Intel chips, and executive turmoil. Today, we will examine the flip side and discuss three strengths investors may have overlooked.
1. Fresh leadership, fresh tacticsLast year, Dr. Lisa Su replaced Rory Read as CEO. Chip chief John Byrne, chief marketing officer Colette LaForce, and chief strategy officer Raj Naik abruptly departed earlier this year. While investors should certainly be concerned with such major changes at the executive level, they should also realize that Read, Byrne, LaForce, and Naik were not exactly steering AMD toward success.
Under Read, operating expenses declined, cash levels were stable around $1 billion, and he ensured that no new debt would come due until 2019. But AMD also scaled back its direct attacks against Intel in PCs and Nvidia in graphics cards, which resulted in lost market share in both categories.
Meanwhile, Su has a background in engineering that Read lacks, which might help AMD diversify into new product categories. 
Shortly before his departure, Byrne dismissed the notion that AMD should expand into the Internet of Things (IoT) to compete against Intel and ARM Holdings, bluntly telling VentureBeat that he was not ""in the business to lose money."" But as I mentioned before, it would be reckless to ignore the IoT market, which IDC forecasts will grow to $7.1 trillion by 2020. Su, who also took over for Byrne, has experience in IoT tech and could help the company expand into that space.
2. Growth in embedded and semi-custom solutionsAMD's core strength is its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business, which manufactures system on a chip (SoC) products. This segment produces components for the Sony PS4 and Microsoft Xbox One, currently the two best-selling consoles in the world. Their robust sales helped the segment boost revenue 51% year-over-year in 2014, accounting for 43% of the top line.
In addition to consoles, AMD has a growing footprint in low-power ""microservers"" that are dedicated to specific tasks, such as loading the background images of a website, and are usually purchased in clusters. By comparison, traditional servers -- mostly powered by Intel Xeon processors -- are powerful but expensive jacks of all trades. IDC expects microservers to account for over 10% of the entire server market by 2016, up from just 0.2% in 2011. 
If AMD Opteron processors can hold the line against Intel Atom and ARM-based SoCs in the microserver market, its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business will continue growing and eventually outweigh the importance of the x86 chip and GPU businesses. Moreover, if AMD changes its tune on IoT devices, the segment could grow even faster.
3. A tempting takeover targetLastly, AMD has been the subject of plenty of takeover rumors. Investors should never buy a beaten down stock hoping for a buyout, but they should understand what makes AMD a lucrative target.
Its most important asset is its long-term license to use the Intel x86 instruction set. This means that a larger, better-funded company could theoretically buy AMD and aggressively attack the near monopolies Intel enjoys in the notebook, desktop, and server markets. That is why AMD is frequently cited as a potential takeover target for companies like Oracle, Broadcom, and Qualcomm. The most recent rumor is that Chinese chipmaker BLX IC Design, which worked with AMD in the past, is interested in acquiring the company.
However, Intel previously tried to prevent AMD from spinning off its manufacturing facilities as GlobalFoundries, claiming that the company could not extend that license to a third party. Therefore, Intel will likely try to block an acquisition of the company. Intel could also try to nullify the x86 license if a takeover occurs, making AMD a much less attractive target. 
Despite those challenges, a market cap of $2.5 billion makes AMD a fairly affordable purchase for an ARM-licensee looking to expand into x86 processors.
The verdictIn my opinion, AMD is still a risky stock to own. However, a change in leadership, growth in embedded and semi-custom SoCs, and the appeal of its x86 license could all help the stock eventually bounce back. But for now, investors should proceed with caution until AMD shows signs of improvement in its long-suffering CPU and GPU businesses.

            ","For the past four years, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has maintained a roughly 60% unit market share in the discrete graphics card market, with the rest going to rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). New product launches and seasonality over that time drove some small fluctuations, but NVIDIA has been able to hang onto its lead.
The third quarter of 2014 marked a distinct change in this dynamic. NVIDIA saw a large increase in its market share, up to around 70%, and it appeared as though NVIDIA was starting to pull away from AMD. This could have just been a fluke, of course, but in the fourth quarter of 2014, NVIDIA's market share rose again, this time to 76%. That's about 11 percentage points higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.

Chart created by author; data from Jon Peddie Research
The graphics card market is starting to look an awful lot like the PC CPU market, where Intel dominates and AMD struggles to turn a profit. AMD needs a huge win with its upcoming launch of new graphics cards, expected sometime in the first half of this year. If it fails to claw back the market share that it's lost, the company risks becoming a bit player in the GPU market, leaving NVIDIA as the undisputed leader.
How did this happen? NVIDIA has benefited from launching an extremely popular pair of graphics cards last September, the GTX 970 and GTX 980. This forced AMD to slash prices across the board, as NVIDIA undercut existing AMD GPUs on price dramatically. The GTX 970 in particular, priced around $350, has proven extremely successful.
According to the Steam Hardware and Software Survey, the GTX 970 is used by more Steam users than any AMD family of GPUs, gaining this lead in the five months since its release. There has been some controversy surrounding the card; whether it ultimately affects sales or benefits AMD is an open question.
An AMD GPU doesn't show up on the survey until the 14th spot, behind eight NVIDIA GPUs and five Intel CPUs with integrated graphics. The AMD R9 200 series, which is AMD's latest high-end family of GPUs, is the 48th most popular graphics card. While this survey isn't a perfect representation of market share, it's likely a very good one, given that Steam users are by definition PC gamers.
The launch of the GTX 970 and 980 certainly contributed to the massive market share gains NVIDIA has enjoyed in the past two quarters. But this kind of thing didn't happen following other major product launches in the past. Instead, NVIDIA's market share stayed roughly the same at around 60%.
Part of this can be explained by the temporary demand created by cryptocurrency miners at the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014. AMD's GPUs are more efficient for mining cryptocurrency, and this helped drive GPU sales for AMD at the time. This demand is now gone, though, and that means a big market has dried up for AMD. This sudden loss of market share may have been more spread out over time had it not been for this temporary surge in demand.
Another component is that AMD has likely fallen behind technologically. The company has been slashing its research and development spending for years, and NVIDIA now outspends AMD despite the latter's far broader portfolio of products. NVIDIA's Maxwell graphics architecture is extremely efficient, and AMD still doesn't have an answer.
AMD needs a big win AMD has a lot riding on its upcoming GPUs. There have been plenty of rumors regarding the cards, but they still haven't been officially announced by the company. The high-end versions will reportedly use a new kind of high-bandwidth memory, giving them an advantage at high resolutions. Whether this leads to higher sales, given the tiny fraction of gamers currently using 4K displays, remains to be seen.
Originally, it was expected that AMD's new cards would be built on a 20nm process, but it's now rumored that both NVIDIA and AMD are skipping 20nm completely. This means any efficiency gains will need to come from AMD's new graphics architecture. This could prove to be a problem, as a new rumor suggests that only the highest-end variants from AMD will be built on a new architecture, with the rest using the current one. What this means if true is unclear, but it does seem strange, and it will make it much more difficult to compete with NVIDIA's midrange Maxwell offerings.
AMD doesn't just need to produce good products, it needs to blow away NVIDIA, both on performance and price. This is starting to seem unlikely, although these rumors could certainly prove incorrect.
If AMD doesn't end up winning back a considerable chunk of market share from NVIDIA when it launches these new cards, it may be time to conclude that NVIDIA's lead has become insurmountable, much like Intel's lead in the PC CPU market.
NVIDIA doesn't have the same advantages that Intel has; both NVIDIA and AMD rely on third-party foundries for manufacturing, unlike Intel. But slashing R&D spending typically doesn't lead to market dominance, and that's exactly what AMD has been doing. The company's PC segment is losing money as it continues to bleed market share to both Intel in CPUs and NVIDIA in GPUs, and the game consoles are the only thing keeping the company afloat.
If AMD doesn't have a smash hit with these new cards, and if NVIDIA doesn't make a huge mistake, NVIDIA could end up becoming the Intel of the graphics card market.

            ","Shares of chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have fallen 15% over the past 12 months as rival Intel has (NASDAQ:INTC) rallied almost 40%. In fiscal 2014, AMD reported a net loss of $403 million, sharply down from a loss of $83 million in 2013, as it struggled to remain relevant in the CPU and GPU markets. 
And things could get much worse for AMD before they get any better. Let's look at three key reasons AMD stock could keep falling this year.
1. Crushed between two giantsFirst and foremost, AMD's margins are getting crushed between Intel's x86 chips and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) high-end graphics cards.
Intel respectively controlled 98.5%, 90.3%, and 81.8% of the server, notebook, and desktop CPU markets in the third quarter of 2014, according to IDC. AMD, left to feed off the scraps of those markets, had to keep selling cheaper chips than Intel to remain competitive. AMD acquired graphics card maker ATI in 2006 to diversify its core business away from CPUs, but that tactic simply sent it into a multiyear price war against NVIDIA. 
This two-pronged war means that AMD has little freedom to raise prices on CPUs or GPUs to offset margin declines. A comparison of AMD's operating margins against Intel and NVIDIA over the past five years shows us where AMD is headed.

On the bright side, AMD's Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business has been booming, fueled by strong sales of its system-on-a-chip, or SOC, products for Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One. Last quarter, the segment's revenue surged 51% year over year in 2014, accounting for 43% of AMD's top line.
2. Falling behind the tech curveAMD recently unveiled its Carrizo SoCs for mobile devices. These SOCs are aimed at gaining ground against ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH)-licensed CPUs, which are installed in the majority of tablets and smartphones worldwide, and Intel's Broadwell chips, which are installed in many newer tablets and 2-in-1 devices.
Carrizo is built on older 28nm tech, compared wwith Intel's 14nm Core M. Intel can develop 14nm chips more efficiently because it has its own foundry.  AMD spun off its foundry joint venture as GlobalFoundries in 2009, and then abandoned that stake in 2012. GlobalFoundries, which still manufactures AMD's chips, plans to start mass production of 14nm chips in the ""first half"" of 2015, but it remains a step behind Intel.
A key difference between 14nm and 28nm chips is that the former is a fanless design, while the latter isn't. This makes Broadwell chips, like the Core M, more attractive to companies that want to produce ultra-thin tablets and 2-in-1 devices. 

Lenovo's Yoga Pro 3 runs on a Core M processor.
AMD is also noticeably absent from the Internet of Things market, or IOT, which is a major blind spot considering that IDC projects global spending on IOT tech to rise from $4.8 trillion in 2012 to $8.9 trillion in 2020. Intel, by comparison, already set up a dedicated IOT business segment last July.
Therefore, Intel's technological superiority, along with its aggressive subsidization plans for its mobile partners, could further reduce AMD's market share.
3. Turmoil at the topLastly, AMD replaced several of its top executives over the past year. Last October, Lisa Su replaced Rory Read as CEO and then promptly announced plans to lay off 7% of AMD's staff. Last month, chip chief John Byrne, Chief Marketing Officer Colette LaForce, and Chief Strategy Officer Raj Naik all stepped down.
In an official statement, AMD claimed that the shakeup would ""sharpen"" the company's execution and position it for growth. But it also indicates that AMD might be suffering from internal conflicts of interest, which could cause it to lose focus as Intel and NVIDIA further marginalize its core businesses.
The takeawaySome contrarian investors might believe that AMD could bounce back on rising console sales or get bought out. Unfortunately, neither reason offsets its lack of pricing power in CPUs and GPUs, its technological inferiority to Intel, and its management issues. Until AMD can address all three of those issues in a meaningful manner, this is one beaten-down stock that I'd avoid.

            ","In the world of PC gaming, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Direct3D, part of DirectX, has long been the dominant graphics API. Almost all high-profile PC games use DirectX, which is tied exclusively to Windows, making the OS the standard for PC gaming.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) attempted to change this last year with the introduction of its own proprietary graphics API, Mantle. Mantle vastly reduced the amount of CPU overhead compared to DirectX, leading to big gains in performance in situations where the CPU was the bottleneck.
I argued last year that Mantle had absolutely no chance of success, and that it would provide no benefit whatsoever to AMD, because the next version of Direct X would introduce the same efficiency gains. With the release of Windows 10 and DirectX 12 coming later this year, the first benchmarks comparing DirectX 12 to Mantle have been released. It's not pretty for AMD.
DirectX 12 is the real deal The folks over at Anandtech recently tested an early version of DirectX 12, and the results show two things.

Source: Anandtech
First, the gains in performance compared to DirectX 11 are substantial, and in cases where the CPU is the bottleneck, big gains are very possible. Second, DirectX 12 produces similar results on AMD cards compared to Mantle. Mantle is still a bit faster in most cases, but given DirectX 12 is still months away from release, this difference may be temporary.
Both DirectX 12 and Mantle achieve these performance gains by eliminating much of the overhead involved with sending commands to the GPU. DirectX 11 hits a severe bottleneck if the number of commands grows too large, and it looks like DirectX 12 will fix this problem.
Why DirectX 12 is important for Microsoft One reason, although certainly not the only reason, that Windows has remained the dominant PC operating system is gaming. The fact that almost all PC games are built on DirectX, instead of the alternative cross-platform OpenGL, gives Windows an enormous advantage. According to the Steam hardware and software survey, about 95.5% of Steam users are running some form of Windows, with the scraps split between Mac and Linux.
Maintaining Windows' dominance in the PC gaming market is critical for Microsoft, and that requires DirectX to remain the de facto standard graphics API. Mantle was always unlikely to usurp DirectX, given that it only works on a subset of AMD products, and neither Intel nor NVIDIA was ever going to support it. But allowing DirectX to fall too far behind could have opened the door for the next version of OpenGL, which will also introduce gains in efficiency. This now appears unlikely given the early DirectX 12 performance numbers.
Why AMD's Mantle will lead nowhere Mantle was always a long shot, but at the very least it likely spurred Microsoft to focus on efficiency. Mantle has gained the support of a decent number of games and game engines, but it's difficult to fathom where Mantle fits once DirectX 12 is released. There may still be some performance benefits for AMD's GPUs, but with NVIDIA the market leader in discrete GPUs and Intel the overwhelming market leader in integrated GPUs, supporting Mantle likely won't make much sense for developers.
AMD's PC business has been falling apart recently, and it was honestly a waste of resources to develop an alternative graphics API. It's now clear from the DirectX 12 performance figures that Mantle's advantage is going to largely disappear later this year, and it's also clear from NVIDIA's market share gains that Mantle has done exactly nothing to boost AMD's GPU business.
AMD deserves credit for starting the conversation on eliminating graphics API overhead. But that conversation will be finished without it, and AMD will get no credit where it matters: the bottom line.

New investors are often attracted to penny stocks due to the large opportunity for profits they seem to present. ""If the shares can just trade up from $0.10 to $0.20 each, I'd double my money"" is a popular line of thinking.
But penny stocks are inherently dangerous: A cesspool of failed companies, frauds, and schemes intended to transfer money from the greedy newbie to their motivated, if unsavory, operators.
The history of penny stocksBefore electronic trading and discount brokerage firms, penny stocks got a bad rap for being prohibitively expensive. In the old days, you'd pay as much as a quarter-point ($0.25) to buy or sell a share of stock.
This was the brokerage firm's commission. And because it was set in stone -- it didn't matter whether a share traded for $1 or $100 -- the commission made up a much bigger portion of your investment in penny stocks than it did on pricier shares.
Many mutual funds enacted policies to avoid stocks which trade for less than $5 per share for reasons of expense (they pay commissions, too) or because of their speculative nature. And over time, it just so happened that the feeling became something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. People avoided penny stocks, and thus it became generally accepted that only the worst companies would let their shares trade at penny stock prices. 
Penny stocks todayThe widely accepted definition of penny stocks has been somewhat extended to cover other, higher-priced stocks which also trade in less-regulated, over-the-counter markets.
Over-the-counter stocks are generally less liquid, and they have fewer requirements to remain listed. Many don't even bother to file financial reports on time, or at all. And they're often managed by people with a less-than-stellar pedigree.
Conflicts of interest are especially common. I've seen it all -- from company-owned planes that are used more for the executives' pleasure than business, to companies that pay above-market rents because the CEO just so happens to also be the landlord.
That isn't to say that these bad behaviors are inherent in penny stocks, just that they're more common. One of the benefits of obscurity is that some managers can get away with a lot more without the benefit of prying eyes looking over their every financial filing.
Should you buy penny stocks?If I were to paint with broad strokes, I'd recommend avoiding them entirely. There are, however, legitimate companies that happen to have low share prices. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), a company which makes many of the chips in electronics ranging from laptops to phones, has long traded for prices in the penny stock range of less than $5. 
Likewise, Roche Holding (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY), a Swiss health care company many would recognize, has shares listed on the over-the-counter market to allow American investors to invest in it.
AMD and Roche are legitimate businesses, and are not penny stocks. They file regular financial reports, adequately disclose their business lines to investors, and are clearly not illegitimate companies. They just happen to have a single trait of most penny stocks -- a low per-share price or an OTC listing.
 Many penny stock and OTC-listed companies are nothing more than shells. They include the likes of marijuana companies that exert more effort to market their stock than their products, and ""dark"" companies that haven't filed financial statements in years.
A large number (by my count over 40%) of OTC stocks are considered ""grey market"" stocks, which do not require any filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Can you imagine investing in a business, having no idea what it earns, or even what its business model entails? That's the case for nearly half of stocks that trade over the counter.
Though they may seem like an easy and simple way to quick profits, know that penny stocks are anything but. The ""easy"" way to get rich in stocks is to buy good businesses and own them for a very, very long time -- years, if not decades. Investors dominate the list of Forbes 400 billionaires, but I can assure you it wasn't penny stocks that created their wealth.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been struggling against rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market, losing market share and reporting dismal fourth-quarter earnings. AMD is expected to launch a new batch of GPUs during the first half of this year, and while I'm not optimistic that a single product launch can right the ship, the company does have a trick up its sleeve. AMD is rumored to be using high-bandwidth-memory, or HBM, in some of its new GPUs, providing drastically more memory bandwidth compared to NVIDIA's products. AMD needs any advantage that it can get, but how meaningful of an impact will HBM really have?
Why memory bandwidth is important GPUs process a tremendous amount of data per second. While performance is ultimately limited by a GPU's processing power, a potential bottleneck is the rate at which a GPU can read data from its own memory. This rate is called the memory bandwidth.
To get a sense of how much data is involved, imagine a graphics card with 4GB of memory running a game at sixty frames-per-second. Each frame, the GPU needs to deal with all of the data necessary to draw the scene, including data representing all of the objects, like characters and buildings, and textures that are applied to those objects. Given the visual detail and richness of modern PC games, an enormous amount of data is needed to make the image on the screen look realistic.
If this hypothetical graphics cards needs to access all 4GB of its memory once per frame, the memory bandwidth needs to be 240 GB/s. This is a simplification: Some data may need to be accessed more than once per frame, and some less frequently, but this estimate is a good ballpark figure. NVIDIA's high-end GTX 980, for example, has a memory bandwidth of 224 GB/s, allowing it to access nearly all of its 4GB of memory every frame.
As the screen resolution increases, the GPU needs to deal with an increasing amount of data. A 4K monitor has quadruple the number of pixels compared to a 1080p monitor, and that means all of the per-pixel data that the GPU churns through quadruples as well.
Star Citizen, an upcoming crowdfunded PC game, will have support for not only 4K resolutions, but 8K resolutions as well. This requires the development team to include 4K and 8K textures for any object that gets close to the player; a lower-resolution texture would appear blurry. The GPU memory bandwidth required to deal with all of this data will need to be truly enormous, to say the least.
Existing graphics cards can play games at 4K resolutions, but not particularly well at high settings. NVIDIA's GTX 980 has trouble hitting playable framerates in many games, and part of the reason is likely its low memory bandwidth.
AMD could own 4K gaming, at least for a while AMD is reportedly going to use HBM in its high-end graphics cards this year, providing a memory bandwidth as high at 640GB/s, according to unconfirmed specifications. That's nearly triple what the GTX 980 offers, and this should help AMD's new GPUs excel at 4K gaming.
NVIDIA will eventually adopt HBM, but it's unlikely to happen until GPUs based on its next-gen architecture, Pascal, are released sometime in 2016. This gap will give AMD's products a distinct advantage in the 4K gaming market for a while.
However, the ultimate importance of this advantage is questionable. The percentage of PC gamers using 4K monitors is currently minuscule, and with all of this extra bandwidth largely unnecessary at lower resolutions, being first may not lead to many extra sales for AMD. Steam's hardware and software survey puts the percentage of its users with a monitor above a resolution of 1080p at just 3.25%. Only 0.03% of users have monitors with 4K resolutions.
Another potential issue is the price. HBM is a new memory technology, which means that it's going to be expensive. We won't know how expensive until AMD's new GPUs are officially announced, but the highest-end GPU may end up being priced well above NVIDIA's GTX 980.
Now, it's possible that AMD's new GPUs will spur adoption of 4K monitors, given that most existing GPUs can't handle 4K very well today. Buy 4K monitors are still quite expensive, and 1080p monitors are far cheaper in comparison. I suspect that 4K monitors will need to become much more affordable for 4K gaming to go mainstream, and that puts a limit on the benefits potentially realized by AMD for being first to market with an HBM graphics card.
If the rumors prove true, AMD's use of HBM will certainly give it an advantage. But given the meager adoption rate of 4K monitors, it probably won't matter very much in the grand scheme of things.

            ","To put it bluntly, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had a terrible fourth quarter. Revenue fell 22% year over year, according to the processor maker's latest earnings release, while earnings, adjusted for some big write-offs, landed at breakeven. While the gaming consoles business kept AMD afloat, the PC business appears to be falling apart. Computing and graphics revenue fell 16% year over year, with the segment losing $56 million during the quarter. Additionally, an inventory write-off related to the company's APUs doesn't exactly vindicate the company's strategy.
Big problemsWhile the PC market has stabilized, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reporting rising PC chip volumes in both the fourth quarter and 2014 as a whole, AMD is still suffering from huge sales declines. With AMD grouping CPUs and GPUs in the computing and graphics segment, it's difficult to tell exactly how each business is doing. But it's clear Intel continues to win market share from AMD, despite already dominating the market.
Of course, Intel has some enormous advantages. While AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its chips, Intel produces its own chips, and it is shipping its new Broadwell processors built on a 14-nanometer process. AMD is still stuck at 28 nanometers, and its upcoming Carrizo APUs, set to launch in the first half of this year, will remain a generation behind Intel. This will make it difficult, if not impossible, for AMD to keep up on power efficiency.
During the fourth quarter, AMD wrote off $58 million of inventory related to its desktop APU products. This should not be ignored: AMD's entire PC strategy has revolved around the powerful integrated graphics in its APUs, but it appears demand simply isn't there. In contrast, Intel reported that its desktop CPU volume fell just 1% during the fourth quarter.
The average selling price of AMD's GPUs also declined year over year, although the company did not disclose any information about volume. Part of this weakness is likely due to the demand from cryptocurrency miners, which buoyed AMD's GPU business in late 2013 and early 2014, vanishing, as pointed out by CEO Lisa Su during the company's conference call. During the third quarter, rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) claimed about 70% of the GPU market by unit volume, and its recent GPU products forced AMD to slash prices late last year.
This is what a train wreck looks like It seems the investment thesis for AMD over the past few years has been that, while things aren't great now, the next batch of products will return the company to prosperity. AMD is launching new APUs later this year, as well as new GPUs, and both come with a bit of hype.
It's the same story, though, every time AMD launches a new product. Expectations are high, but ultimately the company fails to deliver. Both Intel and NVIDIA keep winning market share, and those promising APUs had to be written off in the fourth quarter. AMD is starting to sound like a broken record.
AMD expects revenue during the first quarter to decline by 15% sequentially, anticipating just $1.05 billion in total. The company did not mention how big of a year-over-year decline this would represent, probably because that number is much scarier. AMD is guiding for an astonishing 25% year-over-year revenue decline next quarter. It also expects lower revenue than it collected in the first quarter of 2013, which occurred well before the game consoles even launched. 
At this point, any profits from the game console business are being eaten by PC losses and interest payments. Research and development spending is collapsing, down 19% year over year during the fourth quarter. While cost reductions will help profitability, it's hard to imagine how AMD is supposed to keep up with Intel and NVIDIA by constantly slashing R&D.
Banking on a miracle second half, driven by new product launches, is extremely optimistic. Past new product releases have done little to fix AMD's PC business, and it doesn't look any different this time around. AMD doesn't have the resources to fight multiple wars on multiple fronts with both Intel and NVIDIA, and this is showing in its results. AMD's PC business is unraveling, and there appears to be little hope it can be saved.

            ","The S&P 500 was up over 11% last year, exceeding many analyst expectations. Despite the bullish market, some companies still underperformed. Sometimes it is the entire industry taking a hit, and other times, the poor performance is specific to an individual company. 
Today, three Motley Fool contributors weigh in on the turnaround stories they're watching for 2015: Coach (NYSE:TPR),  Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and InvenSense (NYSE:INVN).
Andres Cardenal (Coach): Coach made a series of expensive mistakes over the last several years -- the company expanded too quickly, designs did not resonate well among consumers, and excessive promotions eroded the brand image. However, management is actively trying to turn things around, and Coach is an interesting candidate to watch in 2015 and beyond.
The company is reducing its store count and cutting back on promotions in order to recover its aspirational halo. It also hired Stuart Vevers as the new creative director in September 2013, and he is working to transform Coach into a full lifestyle brand.
The December quarter will be the first full quarter including sales from his new collection. Considering the importance of the holiday shopping season, the next earnings report should give investors an opportunity to evaluate Coach's ability to get back on track.
Also, while total sales in North America declined 19% year-over-year to $634 million during the third quarter, international revenues were up 4% to $381 million. Sales in China, a particularly promising market for the company, jumped 10% during the period, so international markets seem to offer considerable room for growth in the mid-term.
For what it's worth, management believes the new collection is performing according to expectations, and CEO Victor Luis said in the last conference call that press coverage for this new collection was ""overwhelmingly positive, building on the response to Fall 2014 and driving fashion, credibility, and buzz.""
Anders Bylund (Advanced Micro Devices): AMD had a terrible year in 2014. Share prices plunged 32% lower, mostly in a difficult span from September through October. The microchip designer missed Wall Street earnings targets in each of it two latest quarters, and analysts expect more pain ahead.

But the plucky semiconductor underdog is under new management, and I think that recently appointed CEO Lisa Su has what it takes to turn the beat around. The market, on the other hand, begs to differ.
The biggest drop in October had nothing to do with soft earnings but sprung from the news that Su would be replacing Rory Read in the corner office. The market reaction was like a huge vote of no confidence in the new CEO.
I'm here to tell you that Su knows the business inside and out, having run AMD's global (read: international) business unit since 2012. She comes with a rock-solid technical pedigree with an MIT doctorate in electrical engineering. She's spent more than 20 years running technical and leadership operations at the chip divisions at Freescale, IBM, and Texas Instruments. She's a much needed tech-oriented upgrade from Read's deeper business-side focus.
Rory Read started pointing AMD in a new direction. Su continues to move the company out of the commodity PC processor market and deeper into custom products for markets like gaming consoles and the Internet of Things.
Lisa Su is the right person with the right strategy, at exactly the right time. If the market understands these things in 2015, AMD's stock should run higher once again.
Ashraf Eassa (InvenSense): Over the last year, shares of MEMS vendor InvenSense have lost about 35% -- pretty rough for a company that just won a spot in the latest Apple iPhones!
Last quarter, the company saw a large drop in gross profit margins as a result of an (unexpected) inventory write down. I believe this shook investor confidence, particularly as poor inventory management lies squarely on the shoulders of the people running the company.
InvenSense also reported margin pressure as a result of high customer concentration at Apple and Samsung, which stoked the fears of the risks typically associated with this issue -- continued margin pressure and the potentially huge financial impact of losing a major customer. 
As I've indicated previously, I think the InvenSense ""turnaround"" story in 2015 will consist of two parts. First, InvenSense needs to avoid the execution mishaps that it suffered in 2014. The company really can't afford any negative surprises in the near future if it wants to restore investor confidence. Things happen and no company will execute 100% each-and-every quarter, but InvenSense needs to take particular care in the near-term to set expectations properly and execute well on those expectations.
Next, the company needs to prove that it can, without further eroding its gross profit margin profile, keep its premium mobile device wins while at the same time delivering on its stated goal to push more into the midrange phone market. This could be demonstrated by growing the business at a rapid clip over the next year or so, while maintaining at least a 45% gross profit margin.
InvenSense reports its quarterly earnings on Jan. 29th, and I look forward to seeing how the company performed relative to guidance and what it ends up guiding to for the following quarter.

So you're interested in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). I hope you have a strong stomach, or a duffel bag full of antacids.
When the semiconductor designer reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday evening, the report kicked off a rollicking roller-coaster ride. The stock opened Wednesday's trading session at two-year lows, but immediately bounced back in a big way. Just 40 minutes into the market session, the difference between Wednesday's highs and lows was more than 11%. By 3 p.m., AMD's stock was up some 5% from the previous day's close at $2.24.
Against that backdrop, it can be hard to tell whether AMD's fourth quarter was a big disappointment or a positive turning point. So let me walk you through what's going on here.
First, let's get the basic numbers out of the way.
Analysts were expecting AMD to report net earnings of $0.01 per share on sales of $1.24 billion. Revenues fell 22% year over year to land exactly at the analyst target, yielding breakeven earnings. So in terms of pure earnings figures, the quarter was a slight disappointment.
More to the point, AMD staged a bit of a business revival in 2013 and 2014, but this report took the edge off those gains:

But if every trend is negative, how come the stock is rising again? Here's a novel idea: Investors may be looking beyond the current quarter for signs of a sustainable turnaround. And the numbers rarely tell the whole story.

Recently appointed CEO Lisa Su certainly presented AMD's results in a positive light. ""We made progress diversifying our business, ramping design wins and improving our balance sheet this past year despite challenges in our PC business,"" she said in prepared remarks. The business mix is shifting away from mass-market PC processors and graphics chips, and AMD is leaning more on semi-custom products for embedded systems and game consoles.
In fact, inventories of PC-style products such as CPUs and add-in graphics boards were painfully high at the start of the fourth quarter. AMD took steps to correct the oversupply by reducing manufacturing orders, which led to ""short-term pressure in the business"" but sets AMD up for a stronger 2015.
Here's where the good news starts.
Su knows that AMD is winning in the semi-custom market while losing badly to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the traditional PC segment. Her solution is simple: apply the operating discipline and lessons learned in the custom chip sector to the ailing PC market.
""We clearly have more work to do to improve the overall revenue and financial performance of this segment,"" Su said. ""We must think differently in 2015 about our market approach and investment priorities.""
She's remixing this division to sell more high-end products and fewer of the truly mass-market chips on the lower end. That means leaving some easy but unprofitable sales on the table, but improving profit margins.
On a grander scale, AMD managed to grow full-year sales for the first time since 2011 while also delivering positive non-GAAP earnings.
So Su is not afraid to roll up her sleeves and get some serious work done. AMD's business approach is overdue for an update, and she's getting it done.
As an Intel shareholder, I'm not exactly shaking in my boots over the threat AMD poses right now. But Su's detailed tech insights may set AMD on a path that leads to becoming a serious Intel challenger once again. Right now, she's saddled with repairing the mess that predecessor Rory Read left behind. It's not easy work, and I wouldn't suggest loading your retirement nest egg into AMD stock today. But if she can pull it off, she'll spark an impressive turnaround in AMD's ailing stock as well.
So this one's for the gamblers, the speculators, and those with a bit of disposable funds to play around with. I'm tempted to buy a small ticket to the AMD lottery myself, if only to see what Su can do with it. In the meantime, I just gave AMD a thumbs-up rating in our Motley Fool CAPS system.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have plunged 37% over the past 12 months as the struggling chipmaker announced layoffs and missed Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations under new CEO Lisa Su. 
On Monday, AMD announced the departure of three top executives: Senior Vice President John Byrne, Chief Marketing Officer Colette LaForce, and Chief Strategy Officer Raj Naik. Byrne notably only spent seven months as general manager of the company's computing and graphics division.
Just last week, Byrne discussed his view of the Internet of Things, or IoT during a VentureBeat interview at CES 2015. When asked whether AMD would expand into the IoT market as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has done with wearables and tiny Quark chips, Byrne flatly replied, ""I'm not in the business to lose money. Share and revenue is nice but so is profitability."" Byrne emphasized that AMD should focus on improving the performance and power efficiency of its x86 chips instead.

But now that Byrne has moved on, it might be time for AMD to reevaluate its position on IoT, which could prevent it from being crushed between Intel's x86 chips and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs.
The business of the Internet of ThingsThe concept of IoT is that everything -- wearables, cars, home appliances, and more -- will be connected to one another through various wireless standards. Research firm IDC believes the global IoT market will grow from $1.9 trillion in 2013 to $7.1 trillion by 2020. Presumably, that rising tide could lift chipmakers such as Intel, networking companies such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Internet giants including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Intel's Internet of Things division consists of embedded chipsets that are used in retail environments, industrial sites, buildings, homes, and transportation. Over the first nine months of 2014, revenue at Intel's IoT group rose 23% year over year to $1.55 billion as operating income improved 26% to $431 million. While Intel's IoT segment only accounted for about 4% of its revenue and operating income during that period, its double-digit growth and profitability strongly suggest IoT might not be a money-losing venture for AMD after all.
AMD, though, lacks Intel's market clout -- according to IDC's third-quarter numbers, Intel controls 98.5% of the server market, 90.3% of the notebook market, and 81.8% of the desktop market. This means Intel can likely sell more embedded solutions on the foundations of its x86 market share than AMD can.
Birds of preyThat's not to say AMD does not have any embedded products at all. Last year, the company unveiled several such products -- Adelaar, Steppe Eagle, Bald Eagle, and Hierofalcon -- to expand into industrial control and automation, digital gaming, medical imaging, digital surveillance, smart TVs, and other non-PC businesses.
While those ""birds of prey"" are certainly scouting ahead for a possible expansion into IoT, AMD hasn't split those technologies into a separate IoT business in the way Intel has. Instead, they reside in AMD's enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (server and embedded processors, systems-on-chip, engineering services, and royalties) business.
In the first nine months of 2014, revenue from that segment more than doubled to $1.8 billion and accounted for 42% of AMD's top line. That growth was helped by robust system-on-chip sales of for Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 4 consoles.
Like a frog in boiling waterAMD has always been considered the cheaper alternative to Intel and NVIDIA, respectively, in x86 chips and high-end graphics cards. The problem is that whenever AMD's market share declines, margins fall as it tries to generate fresh revenue growth with cheaper products.

Source: YCharts
In the first nine months of 2014, AMD's computing and graphics revenue (which accounted for 58% of its top line) fell 13% year over year as it posted an operating loss of $20 million. AMD is also falling behind the technological curve when it comes to mobile processors -- its new 28-nanometer mobile Carrizo system-on-chip might not appeal to tablet and two-in-one manufacturers, which are already experimenting with Intel's 14 nm Core M chips.
As AMD's market share remains under pressure in x86 chips and GPUs, it is increasingly finding itself being cornered by Intel. I believe AMD's revenue will keep declining unless the company increases the weight of its higher-growth embedded devices and system-on-chip offerings on its top line. Expanding the company's IoT efforts would be a reasonable way to do so, and would be a solid starting point for Byrne's successor.

            ","A well-known storyline in the PC processor market is that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the dominant player in what Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) former CEO once described as an ""unhealthy duopoly,"" has been taking market segment share away from AMD for some time. According to Citigroup's Chris Danely (via Barron's), Intel continues to do so at the expense of its smaller rival.
The story so far At the high end of the PC market, Intel's PC chips have done extremely well against AMD's offerings. However, AMD had for some time successfully deployed relatively quick, purpose-built, low-cost processors for the lower end of the market. These went up against the old Atom processors, but those Atom chips offered awful performance while AMD's comparable offerings were quite good. It's no surprise AMD did well. 
In fact, AMD did so well that Intel executive, Kirk Skaugen, admitted at an investor conference last year that the company's share in the value portion of the PC market had dropped below 50%. At the time, Skaugen also expressed confidence that the company would win back share with the Bay Trail-M and Bay Trail-D processors launched in late 2013, particularly as those processors had more competitive cost structures than what Intel had used previously in that segment.
Given that Intel reported a 14% increase in its low-cost PC processor revenue during 2014, while AMD's PC-related revenues crumbled, it's a safe bet that Intel gained material share -- just as it had aimed to. 

Intel grew shipments into both high-end and low-end PCs this year. Source: Intel
More of the same probably coming in 2015 I expect this trend to continue throughout 2015. In the midrange and high end of the PC market, Intel's products are extremely competitive, as has been the case for quite some time. And at the lower end of the market, I expect Intel's products to become even more competitive.
Keep in mind that Intel's Bay Trail-M/D chips, while offering very good power consumption and CPU performance, lacked raw graphics performance relative to the AMD parts. While AMD has not released the full specifications of its just-announced Carrizo-L chip, slated to hit the market in mid-2015, Intel is reportedly launching the 14-nanometer successors to Bay Trail-M/D, known as Braswell, in the third quarter of this year.
I believe these will offer better power efficiency than the AMD models, as Braswell will be a 14-nanometer part while Carrizo-L will remain on 28-nanometers. While it's possible, or even likely, that Carrizo-L will offer better raw graphics performance than the highest-end Braswell chips, I think it will require far more power to get that performance.
For low-cost thin, light, and fanless systems, I imagine Braswell will be a more attractive solution than the Carrizo-L part. As a result, I would not be surprised to see further share loss for AMD in the PC market this year. 
2016 is the open question While the market segment share trends outlined here seem reasonable based on what we know, it's too early to call any trends for 2016. Intel will, of course, compete quite fiercely with Skylake and its 10-nanometer Cannonlake part, but AMD also plans to launch its next-generation X86 architecture known as Zen.
AMD bulls are optimistic that Zen, which is the X86 counterpart to the clean-sheet K12 architecture, will improve AMD's competitiveness considerably on the CPU side of things. This part is also reportedly set to be built on a 14/16-nanometer foundry FinFET processes, which should narrow the very wide process gap that seems to exist between AMD's Carrizo/Carrizo-L (28-nanometer) and Intel's Broadwell/Skylake/Braswell (14-nanometer).

            ","Not content with its dependence on the market for traditional PCs, Advanced Micro Devices'(NASDAQ:AMD) recent turnaround strategy has centered on delivering silicon for what it calls semi-custom solutions: PC-like devices powered by slightly customized AMD processors.
There is no better example of AMD's strategy in action than the latest video game consoles: Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) Wii U, Sony's PlayStation 4, and Microsoft's Xbox One all use AMD chips.
Its exposure to the industry gives the company a unique perspective -- as a major supplier, AMD is well-suited to forecast upcoming devices. Last month, it did exactly that. At a Raymond James technology conference, AMD's CFO, Devinder Kumar, announced that his company had secured design wins for two upcoming devices, at least one of which could be a gaming console.
Kumar's comments""I'm pleased to report we have those design wins,"" Kumar said, noting that the company had previously told investors to expect two new semi-custom designs from the company. ""Those parts will get introduced in 2016 ... at least one will be beyond gaming.""
From AMD's perspective, the devices could prove vital: According to Kumar, they could add $1 billion to AMD's revenue over a period of three years from 2016 onward. That's fairly significant, as AMD generated just $1.6 billion of revenue in 2013.
However, their exact nature remains largely unknown. Kumar's wording (""at least one will be beyond gaming"") leaves a lot of possibilities open. Still, it seems fair to say that at least one -- and possibly both -- of these products will play games in some capacity.
Nintendo admits it's working on a new consoleA handheld video game console from Nintendo is a strong possibility. Nintendo's current handheld, the 3DS, is almost four years old. In the past, the Japanese video game giant has released new handheld consoles on a regular basis, launching a new product every four to six years.
Although the market for dedicated handheld consoles has been eroded by the growth of smartphones and tablets, Nintendo's management remains committed to its long-standing strategy. Last month, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto told the Associated Press that his company was hard at work on its next-generation of devices.
Nintendo's 3DS uses an ARM-based processor, and given ARM's advantage in power consumption, the 3DS' successor will likely do the same. That would've been a problem for AMD in the past, but earlier this year, the company secured an ARM license, allowing it to offer both ARM and x86-based processors.
According to Kumar, one of AMD's semi-custom design wins also uses an ARM-based processor. Could it be the next Nintendo handheld? Other AMD executives have made supportive statements -- last June, AMD's Saeid Moshkelani told Barron's that AMD had great interest in the handheld gaming space, noting that despite widespread skepticism, Nintendo's ""3DS is still selling.""
A new entrant?A new console from Sony or Microsoft would be quite a surprise, given the relatively recent debut of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. If AMD isn't making a game device for Nintendo, it might be building a processor for a non-traditional player.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has shown great interest in the space in recent months, hiring major game developers and buying a video game studio outright, in addition to its purchase of the popular video game streaming service, Twitch. Amazon's set-top box, the Fire TV, allows its owners to play video games, though the graphical fidelity is lackluster. A more powerful game console from the e-commerce giant would not be particularly surprising.
There are other possibilities. Android TV, a modified version of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) mobile operating system designed to power set-top boxes, has attracted the attention of several gaming firms. Razer, a company known primarily for its gaming PC peripherals, unveiled the Android TV-powered Forge TV at CES last week. Forge TV sports a Qualcomm chip, but a similar product powered by AMD silicon could eventually make its way to market.
Betting on semi-customUnfortunately, these gaming wins have done little for AMD shareholders. Since the debut of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in Nov. 2013, AMD shares have lost roughly 25% of their value, badly underperforming the broader market. Despite bringing in revenue, AMD's console contracts have been criticized for their low margins.
The same may ultimately hold true for AMD's two new design wins. Still, it's evidence that AMD's plan -- derive 50% of its revenue from high-growth markets, including semi-custom solutions -- is on track.

            ","In 2013, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) outlined a strategy to win back share in the server market after losing significant ground to larger rival, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD asserted it would be ""the leader in ARM servers"" and that it would have ""substantial share of the X86 CPU market"" at some point in the future.
As we enter 2015, it is worth looking at AMD's progress in the server market since those initial announcements.
The story on ARM so far Advanced Micro Devices announced in July that developer kits powered by the Seattle processor were available for purchase. Then, at Hot Chips 2014, AMD did a deeper technical disclosure of the Seattle chip. Since then, though, AMD has been relatively quiet about its dense server efforts.
As Charlie Demerjian of SemiAccurate pointed out last month, two major ARM server chip vendors are now actually selling parts: Cavium and Applied Micro. His article takes a dig at AMD, stating that ""there would be three if the soap opera that is AMD was anything more than infinite but hollow press releases.""
At any rate, while Seattle is a real, working chip, it's not clear whether it is in production yet, and if it is, whether it has many -- if any -- major customers. This will probably become clearer over time.
What about X86? While there has much fanfare around its ARM efforts, AMD has made clear it plans to continue competing in the X86 server chip market. Planet 3DNow! (via WCCFTech) has posted the following AMD server road map, which is current through November 2013:

Source: Planet 3DNow!
According to this road map, AMD has no plans to update its two-socket and four-socket CPUs in 2015. It does, however, plan to bring two new X86 chips to market: Toronto APU and Toronto CPU. These will apparently integrate two Excavator modules/four Excavator x86 cores, support DDR3/DDR4, have PCIe3 support, and come as single, integrated system-on-chip parts.
The main difference between the two chips is that the APU will feature integrated graphics while the CPU apparently will not.
It seems that the ""small"" AMD x86 cores do not make an appearance here, with AMD opting to address any market requiring many small cores with ARM and any markets requiring more per-core performance with its ""big"" X86 cores.
What does AMD's competitive positioning look like in 2015? I don't think this road map is going to be particularly competitive with what Intel should have this year. The aging Warsaw CPUs (32-nanometer Piledriver) will find it difficult to compete with Intel's Haswell-EP and, potentially, Broadwell-EP chips (although the latter have reportedly been delayed into 2016).
For one-socket systems, AMD will likely have to compete with the Xeon E5 v3 chips (Broadwell) during the first half of the year and with the Xeon E3 v5 chips (Skylake) during the second half of the year. Additionally, CPU World reported that Intel's integrated Xeon D processor, which is a system-on-chip design that should be comparable to the Toronto CPU, will launch in the second quarter of 2015.
This should have up to eight Broadwell CPU cores and will be built on Intel's 14-nanometer FinFET manufacturing technology. In contrast, the Toronto CPU features just four Excavator cores (and per-core Excavator is likely weaker than Broadwell).
We'll have to see what kind of I/O AMD brings to Toronto CPU to properly compare the chips. However, my bet is that the 14-nanometer Xeon D will be more powerful and more efficient than what is likely a 28-nanometer Toronto CPU.
AMD probably need to wait until 2016 for a potential improvement Advanced Micro Devices' competitive positioning in the server chip market looks weak during 2015. However, the story could get better in 2016 when AMD is expected to roll out system-on-chip products based on its new X86 and ARM CPU cores known as Zen and K12, respectively. Bringing new technology to market is no guarantee of success (Intel isn't sitting idly by), but it will be interesting to see if AMD can improve its competitive positioning.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares have been in freefall lately. In the week and a half after it slashed its second-quarter guidance earlier this month, AMD stock fell 24%, while arch-rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) decreased just 0.5%, and the S&P 500 market barometer gained nearly 3%. The plunge included a 4.6% drop on Thursday, following Intel's surprisingly solid earnings report, and on the eve of AMD's own presentation.
AMD's second-quarter results are in, and they provided its share price a brief respite from the never-ending slide. AMD stock gained more than 2.5% in after-hours trading as investors absorbed the report. But on Friday, that brief gain was erased in short order. The stock closed another 4% lower that day.
As presaged in the guidance update, AMD's sales decreased 8% quarter over quarter and 35% year over year. At $942 million, it's AMD's lowest quarterly sales since 2004.
This is what AMD is all about right now. Image source: AMD.
The company saw strong demand for enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom chip products, and revenue rose 13% in that division. It wasn't enough to overcome a 29% sequential sales drop in the computing and graphics segment, driven by very weak orders from PC system builders. In particular, notebook processors were in low demand.
On the bottom line, AMD saw an adjusted net loss of $0.17 per share. That's nearly twice the red ink seen in the first quarter, and down from a $0.05 profit per share in the year-ago period.
Analysts were quick to adjust their revenue targets in line with AMD's new guidance. The company didn't offer updated earnings guidance two weeks ago, but did deliver on its promise of an adjusted gross margin near 28%. That was enough to let analysts nail the adjusted earnings figure, too. So the final report was completely in line with Wall Street's expectations -- albeit very recently adjusted ones, based on fresh preliminary data.
AMD's inventory increased by 16% during the quarter, partly due to preparing the channel for upcoming holiday season builds, and partly caused by the slow PC components flow. A year ago, inventory rose 10% in the second quarter.
The embedded and semi-custom division accounted for 60% of AMD's sales in the second quarter, up from 46% in the previous quarter, and 42% in the year-ago period. AMD is a company in transition, swearing off the traditional PC market and embracing new opportunities in the embedded market.
This is similar to the way Micron Technology is shifting its memory chip production over from desktop and notebook products and deeper into mobile and embedded chips. Intel is taking a somewhat different path, emphasizing server products more than mobility. But all of these current and former PC giants are looking for new markets right now.
AMD CEO Lisa Su. Image source: AMD.
Can AMD pull this off? The company sold off all of its short-term investment papers during the second quarter, and burned through 8.4% of its total cash equivalents. It ain't easy being AMD right now, and CEO Lisa Su must turn this cash-leaking ship around in short order. If it continues at this rate for a couple more years, AMD will have to find new funding for its day-to-day operations.
The quicker Su can abandon the increasingly hopeless PC market and double down on mobile products plus the booming Internet of Things market, the better. It's already happening, as the sales mix between AMD's two divisions shows. Just, you know, not quite fast enough.
AMD's results were solid enough to slow the share price free fall, but hardly impressive in their own right. The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since that fateful guidance update, and a heart-stopping 53% over the last year. Several analyst houses have ""buy"" ratings on AMD stock with price targets as generous as $5 per share. I wish Lisa Su and her team the best of luck in getting there, but it's a risky and uncertain road with more dangers than opportunities ahead.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently announced a few graphics cards based on its new Fiji graphics processor design. These Fiji-based designs allow AMD to compete at the $549 and $649 price-points that rival graphics processor vendor, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), has dominated for quite some time.
That said, according to website Hardware Luxx , which claims to have spoken to AMD's add-in board partners, AMD is having difficulties supplying enough of its Fiji graphics chips in order to satiate demand. In fact, supplies are reportedly so right that a number of AMD's add-in board partners are apparently unable to launch their own Fiji-based graphics cards.
Although some view such shortages as a good thing (i.e., demand outstripping supply), such a shortage actually seems to be quite negative for AMD. Let me explain.
Fiji tomorrow, or Maxwell today? The first issue here is that the Radeon R9 Fury and the higher-end Radeon R9 Fury X aren't by any means ""clean kills"" in terms of performance, power consumption, or even outright value relative to the NVIDIA competition.
The R9 Fury X, AMD's cream-of-the-crop, is generally believed to be slightly slower than NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 980 Ti offered at the same price point. The $549 Fury, according to TechPowerUp, delivers more performance than the $499 GeForce GTX 980, but loses in terms of performance-per-watt and performance-per-dollar at high-end resolutions (2560-by-1440 and 3840-by-2160).
In addition to a value proposition that isn't so clear, the cards are also reportedly very difficult to find.
Indeed, when I went to Newegg.com (one of the most popular online retailers for computer gear) in search of a Radeon R9 Fury X, I saw the following:

AMD's new GPU is really hard to buy. Source: Newegg.com
To the gamer who wants to buy a Radeon R9 Fury or R9 Fury X today, I say ""good luck.""
In contrast, I seem to have no issue finding all sort of GeForce GTX 980 cards.  There are also plenty of such cards that are designed to run at faster speeds than what NVIDIA runs them at out of the factory, which probably helps close the performance gap between the stock GTX 980 and the R9 Fury.
The same applies to the GeForce GTX 980 Ti; there seem to be plenty of these cards in stock from a variety of vendors. There even seem to be a number of models that run at speeds higher than what NVIDIA specifies them at, which should help widen the performance gap between NVIDIA's best and AMD's best.
AMD needs to improve supply ASAP NVIDIA seems to be in the driver's seat. At the $649-and-up price points, NVIDIA's offerings seem to be widely available and deliver better performance to boot. Against the regular Fury, it seems that there are plenty of GTX 980 models available that would arguably be more attractive to buyers, especially as many factory overclocked versions seem to retail for under $549.
Although having product in greater supply won't fundamentally change the value proposition provided by the Radeon R9 Fury/Fury X, AMD at the very least needs to make sure that cards are available so that users who need to upgrade now (especially those who have been waiting for both AMD and NVIDIA to launch their respective chips) and have a slight preference for AMD will not be swayed by an NVIDIA offering.

            ","Graphics-chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announced its Radeon R9 Fury X flagship graphics processor last month at a $649 price point. The graphics processor was competent, but in third-party performance tests, NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) competing GeForce GTX 980 Ti -- which sells at the same price and launched ahead of the Fury X -- proved to be slightly faster and was also more power-efficient.
As fellow Fool Timothy Green put it, AMD's new offering simply wasn't good enough.
However, the NDAs recently lifted on AMD's Radeon R9 Fury. The Fury is based on the same chip as the higher-end Fury X, but it is partially disabled and air-cooled (as opposed to water-cooled in the case of the Fury X), and as a result, it will be sold for $100 less than its more premium counterpart. 
Although the Fury X failed to deliver the kind of performance and, ultimately, value that some AMD shareholders may have hoped for, might the lower-priced Radeon R9 Fury be a more viable contender in the high-end graphics processor market? Let's take a look.
Performs better than a GTX 980, but costs more The main issue with the Radeon R9 Fury X is that it offered slightly lower performance on average than the GTX 980 Ti but was priced the same as the NVIDIA offering. Given that NVIDIA is widely regarded as the ""premium"" brand and AMD more of the ""value"" brand, it's not clear how successful the Fury X will ultimately be. 
By contrast, the Radeon R9 Fury, according to Tech Power Up, delivers about 7.5% more performance on average than the $499 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 in the site's test suite at 2560-by-1440 resolution and nearly 15% more performance at a more demanding 4K resolution. 
That said, even though the Fury has a performance edge on the 980, the 980 looks more efficient in these tests, delivering better performance per watt at 2560-by-1440 and 4K resolutions than the Radeon R9 Fury X on the order of 19% and 12% respectively. 
In terms of value, the GTX 980 also delivers better performance per dollar than the R9 Fury, although the advantage to the 980 there is 12% at 2560-by-1440 resolution and 5% at 4K resolution.
Is the Radeon R9 Fury a winner? Based on Tech Power Up's tests of average frames per second, it looks like the Radeon R9 Fury is little faster than the GeForce GTX 980, but it's less efficient and offers slightly less performance per dollar.
It's not a bad effort from AMD. But at the price it's asking for this chip, it's hard to see AMD gaining significant amounts of market segment share with the Radeon R9 Fury, given the efficiency and performance-per-dollar deficit of the R9 Fury relative to the GTX 980.
What does this mean for AMD? At this point, I wouldn't be willing to bet on a significant improvement in AMD's graphics-related market segment share. 
That said, I plan to keep a close eye on the financial results and management commentary from both AMD and NVIDIA with respect to graphics to see if there's anything interesting going on with respect to market-share shifts and the potential impact such shifts could have on both graphics vendors' businesses.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has fallen on extremely hard times. In the CPU market, the Intel juggernaut has only grown more dominant in recent years, continually stealing away market share and pushing AMD's PC chip business into the red. In the GPU market, NVIDIA has grown its market share substantially over the past year, shipping 77.5% of discrete GPU's during the first quarter.
With Windows 10 set to launch later this month, the biggest new feature for PC gaming is DirectX 12, Microsoft's new graphics API, the software that allows applications to access the graphics hardware. The biggest improvement that DirectX 12 brings to the table is a vast reduction in overhead, freeing the CPU from wasting time sending commands to the GPU, in part by fully utilizing every core of a multi-core CPU.
Because AMD's CPUs generally have worse single-threaded performance compared with Intel CPUs, DirectX 12 should provide some performance benefits for a PC powered by an AMD CPU or APU. And regardless of the configuration, any game where the CPU is the bottleneck should see improvements in performance.
How much of an improvement will gamers see? Well, according to an article on AMD's website, a massive one:

Source: AMD.
A factor of 16 increase in graphics throughput on AMD's Radeon GPUs sounds impressive, but this slide is a bit deceptive. It measures draw calls, which are commands sent to the GPU from the CPU to draw something. DirectX 12 greatly reduces the overhead involved with each draw call, allowing for this massive increase.
But the number of draw calls is not a measure of performance. The GPU can only draw so much stuff per frame, and what DirectX 12 does is ensure that the GPU will never be waiting for commands from the CPU. The typical way that game developers have dealt with draw call limitations in the past has been to batch objects into the same draw call, thus reducing the total number of draw calls.
DirectX 12 is very similar to Mantle, AMD's now-defunct graphics API, and it's obvious from Mantle benchmarks that real-world situations yield far smaller benefits for AMD's hardware. According to Techspot, using Mantle instead of DirectX 11 produced performance gains around 5% in most cases where a discrete graphics card was used. AMD's APUs, which have integrated graphics, produced bigger gains in some cases, but only because AMD's CPUs are so weak compared with Intel's to begin with.
The actual improvements in frame rates that DirectX 12 delivers will depend on the situation, and while reducing CPU overhead gives game developers extra CPU cycles to work with, performance is ultimately limited by the GPU itself. In situations where the CPU wasn't the bottleneck to begin with, performance gains will be minimal.
Not a game changer for AMD There are certain cases where AMD's CPU will see major improvements in performance with DirectX 12. When the bottleneck is the CPU, the performance gap between AMD's and Intel's processors closes dramatically. Anandtech posted some benchmarks earlier this year that showed AMD's APUs neck-to-neck with Intel when running a very CPU-heavy test.
But in the real world, DirectX 12 doesn't save AMD from the fact that its CPUs are inferior to Intel's in terms of performance. And there's no reason to believe that DirectX 12 will give AMD's GPUs an advantage against NVIDIA, or vice versa. While some tests done by PC Perspective, and cited by AMD, suggests that AMD's R9 290X can deliver more draw calls per second compared to NVIDIA's GTX 980, that's not a meaningful measure of performance. The GTX 980 is substantially more powerful than the 290X, and DirectX 12 doesn't change that.
DirectX 12 is a great development for gamers, delivering a modest performance boost in most cases, and a large performance boost in certain cases. It's also great for developers, freeing them from having to deal with the draw call overhead that plagued DirectX 11. But it doesn't change AMD's competitive position in the CPU or GPU markets. DirectX 12 is no game changer for AMD.

            ","Struggling chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is expected to report its second quarter earnings result and provide guidance for its third quarter on an earnings call scheduled for Thursday, July 16.
The company recently negatively preannounced its second quarter results, stating that revenue will be down 8% from the prior quarter, against prior guidance of a 3% decline, give or take 3%. AMD also said that its gross profit margin for the quarter would be just 28%, down from prior expectations of 32%, as the company's revenue mix shifted more toward lower margin semicustom and embedded chip sales from PC microprocessors.
When AMD reports, here are three things that investors should watch closely.
Second half of 2015 guidance At its Financial Analyst Day, AMD said that it expected its revenue to grow by 15% in the second half of 2015 over that of the first half of 2015. I am looking for a forecast reduction on AMD's part, driven principally by a weaker-than-expected demand for its PC APU products.
Right now, analyst consensus calls for AMD to deliver $4.1 billion in sales for the balance of the year. Given that AMD did $1.03 billion in sales during the first quarter of the year and an 8% reduction from those levels puts sales for the second quarter at roughly $948 million, consensus estimates are calling for just 7.2% growth from the first half of the year to the second half of the year.
If AMD revises guidance for the second half of the year to something greater than a 7.2% increase from the first half, then this could be a positive for the stock. Similarly, if AMD's guidance for the second half comes in lower than that, shares could see further pressure.
Progress in gaining market segment share On the last earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su told analysts that management sees opportunities to grow its market segment share ""particularly in the graphics business"" during the second half of the year. I would be interested to hear management discuss its progress on this front and whether management still thinks it can regain share in the graphics and PC microprocessor markets during the second half of the year.
What about margins? During the first quarter of 2015, AMD's gross profit margin percentage (on a non-GAAP basis) was 32%, and now management expects that figure to come in at 28% in the second quarter.
It will be interesting to see how the company's gross profit margin percentage trends during the second half of 2015, particularly as management's prior margin guidance for the second half of the year was in the range of 32-34%. 
Given that AMD's margins were negatively affected by lower PC processor sales in the second quarter, a downward revision to PC processor shipment expectations might also mean lower margins in the second half of the year. Lower margins, coupled with potentially lower-than-expected revenue, might make it difficult for AMD to hit its forecast of profitability during the second half of the year.
Investing takeawayI'm not expecting much in the way of ""positive surprises"" on the upcoming earnings call. The situation for AMD doesn't look good, and in the near term I don't think there's much that the company can do about it. 
Over the medium term and the long term, AMD is betting on a wave of new products to help improve its competitive positioning in the PC market, grow its semicustom business, regain share in discrete graphics, and reestablish itself as a credible player in the server market.
Whether AMD is able to turn itself around and deliver on the vision that it outlined at its Financial Analyst Day, only time will tell.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is set to report its second-quarter earnings after market close on July 16. After an update from AMD on July 6, which served to cut the company's outlook substantially, the second quarter is expected to be even worse than previously anticipated. AMD now expects revenue to fall 8% sequentially, or about 34% year over year, compared with previous guidance of a 3% sequential decline. As the weak PC market ravages demand for the company's products, AMD is struggling to even predict how bad its results will be.
2015 guidance may need an adjustment Back in May, AMD held an analyst day event, providing an optimistic outlook for the rest of 2015. At the time, AMD expected to be profitable during the second half of the year, producing 15% revenue growth compared to the second half of 2014. Given the major correction to AMD's second quarter guidance, this may need an adjustment.
Along with lowering revenue expectations for the second quarter, AMD announced that it would be taking a $33 million charge associated with moving several product designs, originally designed for a 20nm node, to a leading-edge FinFET node. AMD has previously stated that some 20nm products would launch later this year, probably APUs, but this charge could mean that this is no longer the case.
AMD's optimistic forecast for the second half of the year was based on new products, but if no new APUs are set to be released, AMD will be relying on its recently announced graphics cards to do the job, along with a potential boost in PC demand related to Windows 10. IDC is predicting that the PC market will decline by 6.2% this year, so Windows 10 may not provide any boost at all.
AMD's new high-end Fury graphics cards introduced a real competitor to NVIDIA at the high end of the market after months of allowing NVIDIA free rein. Over the past few quarters, NVIDIA has grown its share of the add-in board market to 77.5%, up from around 60% that has been the norm over the past few years. Simply offering an alternative to NVIDIA should allow AMD to win back some market share, but since AMD failed to truly disrupt the market with its new products, NVIDIA should retain much of its advantage.
This leads to the conclusion that AMD's guidance for the second half is unrealistic, and just two months after first issuing it, I wouldn't be surprised if the company backtracked during its conference call. I don't see a scenario where AMD grows revenue by 15% and returns to profitability in the second half.
How big will the losses be? During the first quarter, AMD posted an operating loss of $137 million, down from an operating profit of $49 million during the first quarter of 2014. There was an $87 million restructuring charge included in that figure, but no matter how you slice it, AMD lost money during the quarter.
The computing and graphics segment posted a $75 million operating loss, down from a slight gain of $3 million during the same period in 2014. Meanwhile, the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment saw its operating profit nearly cut in half, to $45 million. Everything else, including that restructuring charge, contributed a $107 million operating loss.
With demand for PCs weaker than AMD anticipated, I would expect the computing and graphics segment to post an even bigger operating loss during the second quarter. The CPU and APU business is unlikely to improve going into the second half, and while graphics cards may provide a boost to sales, it's hard to imagine the segment posting a profit in the foreseeable future.
AMD can only cut costs so much, and R&D spending has already declined significantly over the past few years. A tech company without adequate R&D isn't going to stand the test of time, and it's becoming more difficult each quarter to believe that AMD can ever become competitive with Intel again. AMD investors still clinging to hopes of a turnaround aren't going to like AMD's second-quarter earnings.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is hurting today. Shares of the microprocessor designer plunged in Monday's after-hours session, setting new 52-week lows in the process. AMD stock opened 17% lower on Tuesday.
The kicker? AMD's dramatic drop follows news that should have been baked into the stock price all along. Investors just forgot all about it, distracted by rumored buyout talks and Father Time.
Right after Monday's closing bell, AMD published an update to its second-quarter guidance figures. And it was all bad news.
Second-quarter sales are now expected to fall 8% sequentially, which works out to roughly $950 million. AMD's original guidance pointed to a smaller 3% drop, or $1.0 billion. Either way, it's a big move from the year-ago quarter's $1.4 billion in total revenue.
At the same time, adjusted gross margin targets were reduced from 32% to 28%. A year ago, that margin sat at 35%.
Image source: AMD.
To explain these reduced expectations, AMD pointed to weak demand for PC systems. The more profitable enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom division accounted for 48% of AMD's sales in the first quarter. That portion will grow in the second period, which should help buttress AMD's margins, but that effect isn't strong enough to overcome the loss of PC-market sales volume.
Moreover, AMD will record a one-time charge of $33 million to account for several product designs moving onto the more advanced FinFET manufacturing process.
If you're wondering how long the design lead times can be in the semiconductor industry, let me point out that AMD first announced its FinFET ambitions 13 years ago, and is only now taking advantage of this hyper-efficient design method. What once was seen as a ""ten-fold performance leap"" is now just another incremental step in the evolution of processor designs. This stuff takes time, people.
But let's get back to the present day. Or rather, to the magical far-away haze of two weeks ago.
That's when memory chip producer Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) announced terrible second-quarter results and equally weak forward guidance, all due to a soft PC market. As investors digested this hard-hitting prognosis, Micron's shares fell 22% over the next two trading days. AMD followed suit with a 9% plunge of its own. Even industry titan Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) took that news on the chin, as shares lost 5% of their value.
Intel and Micron have stayed down since that fateful report, but AMD hasn't. According to the rumor mill, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) weighed buying out AMD to gain control of the Xbox One's central processor technology (which also underpins the PS4 and Wii U rival systems). The buyout looks like a bad idea for Microsoft, and even if these talks are real, they're not likely to result in an AMD buyout.
Still, the mere hint of a positive exit strategy was enough to hold AMD shares aloft. As of Monday night, the stock had rebounded nearly 6% from the darkest hours of Micron's PC industry revelations.
The Microsoft buffer is all gone now and then some. Again, AMD is trading at multiyear lows this morning. AMD is set to report full results on July 16, the day after Intel's second-quarter update. After these two announcements, we'll know a lot more about the overall health of the PC markets -- and it won't be a pretty picture.
But you can't say that Micron didn't warn you. AMD only underscored what we had already been told.

            ","What: Shares of semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell as much as 18% on very heavy volume in the early Tuesday session. The company yesterday reduced its second-quarter guidance, one week before the final report. By 11:15 a.m., the stock was down 15.4%.
So what: In a guidance update published Monday night, AMD reduced its second-quarter revenue guidance from $1 billion to roughly $950 million. The gross margin outlook was also diminished from 32% to 28%, all due to unexpectedly slow orders from the PC systems sector.
Now what: AMD shares had already taken a recent haircut when fellow semiconductor veteran Micron Technology blamed a weak second quarter on PC-market troubles. The stock recovered nicely amid buyout speculation, but this late-hour guidance reduction took all the wind out of AMD's sails in short order. AMD shares hit multiyear lows in early Tuesday trading.
Investors are now looking back at a steep 50% price drop in AMD shares over the last year, and this PC market update doesn't indicate a quick end to the misery. Recently appointed CEO Lisa Su faces an incredibly difficult turnaround task here, and maybe even an impossible one.
Tune in to AMD's full earnings report on July 16 for a deeper dive into this troubled company's progress and prospects (or lack thereof). Until then, rest assured that PC vendors aren't building a ton of systems right now. Expect the back-to-school and holiday seasons to show lower PC sales than usual, with all that implies for component suppliers to that sector.

            ","Just 10 days from its formal earnings release, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) pre-announced that its revenue for the quarter will come in lower than expected. In particular, AMD is now calling for an 8% sequential drop in sales from the first quarter, a significantly larger decline than the 3% drop it had originally called for.
This weakness, per AMD's press release, has been driven by ""weaker than expected consumer PC demand,"" leading to lower APU sales to system vendors.
AMD also reduced its gross profit margin guidance for the quarter (on a non-GAAP basis) from 32% to just 28%. This reduction is due to a ""higher mix of Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment sales,"" as a result of the aforementioned PC weakness.
Finally, the company announced that its GAAP gross profit margin will take a one-time hit associated with scrapping product designs that had been started on the 20-nanometer manufacturing node but are now being transitioned to FinFET manufacturing.
Although AMD laid out an optimistic long-term view at its recent Financial Analyst Day, the reality here is that AMD's business seems to be going from ""bad"" to ""worse."" 
Is this ""just"" a PC problem, or is it an AMD problem? It won't be too long now before both AMD and PC processor peer Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) report their full quarterly results. A question that will be of critical importance to AMD is whether this revenue shortfall is due just to the rough shape the PC market's in, or if AMD is continuing to lose significant market share to Intel.
My guess is that the full quarterly results from both chipmakers will show a combination of both. I expect that Intel's Skylake chips will offer better performance per watt than anything AMD will be able to field this year. Furthermore, given the status of the PC market and that Intel has factories to keep filled, I wouldn't be surprised if Intel gets more aggressive on pricing its chips in a bid to capture additional market share.  
Will guidance for the second half of the year need to come down? At AMD's financial analyst day back in May, CFO Devinder Kumar said the company expects to grow revenue by 15%, give or take 3%, in the second half of the year from levels seen in the first half of 2015. Additionally, Kumar said AMD's gross profit margin will move from 32% in the first half to 32%-34% in the second half and operating expenses would come down from $715 million to between $680 million and $700 million.
All told, that prior guidance called for AMD to see a net profit and positive free cash flow in the second half of the year.
I expect AMD to bring down its full-year revenue guidance, although by how much isn't clear yet. In its prior guidance for the second half of the year, AMD was looking for operating profit of about $69 million (assuming $2.3 billion in sales, 33% gross profit margin, and $690 million in operating expenses).
Note that AMD brought in $1.03 billion in revenue last quarter and now expects revenue for the second quarter to be down by 8% from that level, implying a first half of 2015 revenue base of about $1.98 billion.
If AMD lowers its second-half growth estimates to 10% from 15% (which still might be optimistic) and hits the low end of its previously stated gross profit margin (32%-34%) and operating expense ($680 million-$700 million) ranges, it could still eke out a $17 million operating profit for the second half of the year.
However, if AMD guides for revenue growth in the second half of the year that's meaningfully lower than that, or if its gross margin comes under further pressure, then AMD could very well wind up losing money in the second half of the year as well.
Things don't look good for AMD today and it's hard to see things getting much better anytime soon.

            ","Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is rumored to be interested in acquiring chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), according to recent reports from Reuters and KitGuru. The takeover talks reportedly started a few months ago, although additional details are currently unknown.
AMD currently has a market cap of $1.8 billion, and Microsoft has $95.3 billion in cash, so it would be an easy purchase for the tech giant. But before investors get too excited about this buzz reviving AMD stock -- which has fallen more than 40% over the past 12 months -- they should understand that these rumors are unlikely to bear fruit.

Source: AMD.
Possible reasons for buying AMDAMD has been losing ground to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in x86 processors and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphics cards for years, yet it recently found a comfortable niche with SoCs (system on chips) for gaming consoles. AMD currently provides the SoCs for Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One -- the two top consoles of the current generation.
Microsoft and Sony both pay AMD roughly $100 per console for those SoCs, which merge the CPU and GPU on a single chip. Microsoft has sold 12.6 million Xbox Ones since late 2013, which equals $1.26 billion in payments to AMD. Therefore, buying AMD to save the gross profits on those payments (estimated to be about 20%) sounds like a good idea. Sony would be ironically forced to pay Microsoft to keep using AMD SoCs if Microsoft bought AMD, and Microsoft could further lower the price of the Xbox One to undercut the PS4.

The Xbox One. Source: Microsoft.
AMD claims that its graphically powerful SoCs are well-suited for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications. If Microsoft acquires AMD, it could install those SoCs in the HoloLens AR headset and similar devices. AMD also owns a software suite for VR headsets, known as LiquidVR, which reduces the lag in VR image processing that can cause motion sickness. That software, which only works with AMD hardware, could be useful if Microsoft expands its presence into the VR market.
But here's the problemMicrosoft and AMD certainly have some aligned interests, but AMD has huge flaws that could offset any synergistic gains. AMD's business is split into two parts -- the Computing & Graphics (x86 chips, GPUs, and graphics cards) division and the Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (SoCs, embedded chips) one.
Last quarter, revenue at Computing & Graphics, which accounted for 52% of AMD's top line, fell 38% annually to $532 million, and its operating loss widened from $39 million to $107 million. This was due to lower PC sales and competitive pressure, which forced AMD to lower prices to preserve market share.
AMD's EESC business, which generated the remaining 48% of its top line last quarter, fared slightly better. Sales slipped just 7% annually to $498 million, but operating income dropped 47% to $45 million. AMD blamed ""seasonally lower sales"" of semi-custom SoCs, hinting that rising sales of consoles wasn't enough to lift the entire business. Therefore, it's impractical for Microsoft to inherit all those problems just to cut the cost of the Xbox One or gain an early edge in the fledgling AR/VR markets.
A partial sale wouldn't workTo cut off the burnt crust, Microsoft could theoretically buy AMD's EESC division and leave the Computing & Graphics unit with AMD. Unfortunately, AMD probably wouldn't agree to that partial sale for two reasons.
First, the SoCs which Microsoft needs are based on technologies developed for its server microprocessors and high-end graphics cards. Selling one unit without the other would cause a major fracture in R&D. Second, the EESC business is AMD's only way to offset the ongoing losses at its Computing & Graphics division.
But even if AMD sold the EESC business to Microsoft, the division's lackluster bottom-line growth would weigh down Microsoft's earnings, which are already under pressure from offering free/discounted Windows licenses and year-long trial offers of Office 365. Analysts are already expecting Microsoft's earnings to drop 8% this year, and buying AMD -- either as a whole or in bits -- would likely lead to downward revisions.
Shop elsewhere, MicrosoftAMD's market cap is basically pocket change for Microsoft, but inheriting all of AMD's problems simply wouldn't be worth the effort. Over the past two years, Microsoft has bought plenty of smaller companies to boost its cloud business, which had an annual run rate of $6.3 billion last quarter. Therefore, it makes more sense to buy smaller CRM, machine learning, or analytics firms to grow its cloud business than it does to acquire a fallen chipmaker like AMD.

After months of speculation and waiting, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) finally took the wraps off of its new high-end graphics cards. The fastest of the bunch, the Fury X, is priced at $649, meant to compete directly with NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) identically priced GTX 980 Ti. With new high-bandwidth memory and a water-cooling solution, the Fury X is certainly an impressive piece of hardware. But while AMD has successfully closed the performance gap with NVIDIA at the high end, it failed to launch anything truly disruptive.

A look at the Fury X AMD actually announced two lines of new graphics cards in June. The Radeon 300 series encompasses rebrands of the company's previous Radeon 200 series, while three high-end cards, the Nano, the Fury, and the Fury X, are built on a new iteration of AMD's Graphics Core Next architecture. These high-end cards come with high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, and the Fury X sports 8.6 teraflops of single-precision floating point performance.
AMD has built a very fast graphics card with state-of-the-art memory technology, and its water-cooling solution allows the Fury X to be about 3 inches shorter than AMD's previous flagship, the 290X. After months of being unable to effectively compete with NVIDIA at the high end of the market, the Fury X officially puts AMD back in the game.
In terms of performance, the Fury X is very close to the GTX 980 Ti. In a review on Tom's Hardware, the reviewer said the Fury X delivers performance surreally similar to NVIDIA's 980 Ti, with the 980 Ti having a slight advantage at lower resolutions and the Fury X having a slight advantage at higher resolutions.
AMD's use of HBM doesn't seem to give the Fury X any discernible advantage. The fraction of gamers playing at 4K resolutions, where the Fury X is at its best against the 980 Ti, is still minuscule, according to Steam's hardware and software survey. 4K gaming will certainly become more prevalent as the price of 4K monitors comes down, but with NVIDIA expected to use HBM in its upcoming Pascal graphics cards in 2016, being first might not yield any benefits at all for AMD.
What it means for AMD When AMD launched its previous lineup of graphics cards, the Radeon 200 series, in 2013, the company successfully disrupted NVIDIA. With the flagship 290X boasting better performance and a lower price than NVIDIA's high-end offerings, NVIDIA was forced to slash prices on its graphics cards in order to compete.
NVIDIA returned the favor when it launched its GTX 970 and 980 last September. NVIDIA priced its new high-end cards extremely aggressively, forcing AMD to slash prices. The GTX 970, which cost about $330 at launch, wasn't too far off from the performance of AMD's 290X, which was priced at $550 at the time. And the GTX 980 vastly outperformed every single AMD GPU graphics card available.
This trend of NVIDIA and AMD constantly leapfrogging each other comes to an end with the launch of the Fury X. Instead of disrupting NVIDIA, AMD has simply matched its rival, offering the same performance for the same price. While NVIDIA had the high end of the market largely to itself since September, AMD will not enjoy the same advantage.
AMD will almost certainly win back some market share at the high end, the result of simply having a viable alternative to NVIDIA's products. Over the past few quarters, NVIDIA has vastly increased its market share of the discrete GPU market, and I suspect some of these gains will now be erased.
But without truly disruptive products from AMD, NVIDIA will likely remain the market leader for the foreseeable future. Instead of both companies leapfrogging each other with each new product launch, NVIDIA has taken a leap forward, and AMD has taken months to simply catch up.
This could be the inevitable result of AMD slashing its research and development budget over the past few years. NVIDIA actually surpassed AMD in R&D spending in 2013, despite AMD having a far broader business, competing in PC CPUs, server CPUs, and discrete graphics cards.
AMD's Fury X is an impressive graphics card, but it's not good enough. AMD needed to disrupt NVIDIA, but Fury X doesn't do that. While AMD will likely reclaim some market share, the company runs the risk of being permanently stuck in second place behind NVIDIA.

            ","The lower shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) go, the wilder the buyout rumors seem to get. This time, we have KitGuru reporting that it's heard that software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is interested in buying the struggling chipmaker.
Microsoft reportedly ""approached AMD several months ago,"" but the results of the talks are ""unclear,"" according to the report.
Details of this rumored acquisition end there, but KitGuru's Anton Shilov suggests that buying AMD could help Microsoft save ""around a billion per year on Xbox One chips."" He then further suggests that if Microsoft could get AMD to put together ""appropriate chips for smartphones and tablets,"" Microsoft could save even more money.
I think this ""rumor"" is unlikely to have much substance, and the cited rationale behind such a deal is tenuous at best. Here's why.
How much money would Microsoft really save on Xbox One chips? The first argument that Shilov makes is that Microsoft could save about ""a billion per year"" by no longer having to pay a third party to buy chips for the Xbox One. However, it's my understanding that Microsoft essentially funds the development of the chip upfront, relieving AMD of the R&D burden associated with the chip development.
In exchange for funding the development, the per-unit margins that AMD is able to command when it actually sells these chips to the customer are lower.
According to AMD CFO Devinder Kumar on the company's Q1 2014 earnings call, gross profit margin on the game console chips is lower than the corporate average. Given that AMD reported 35% gross profit margin in that quarter, we can assume that console chip gross profit margins were lower than that.
To figure out just how much Microsoft would save on console chips if it didn't have to hand over any margins, let's assume that the chips bring in a 30% gross profit margin for AMD. This would mean that Microsoft would save -- assuming KitGuru's figure of $1 billion worth of console chip sales per year -- $300 million per year in Xbox chip cost of goods sold.
It hardly seems likely that Microsoft would want to buy the entirety of AMD just to save $300 million per year on semi-custom game console chips.
Chips for smartphones and tablets? Shilov also says that AMD could help Microsoft put together smartphone processors for tablets and phones, presumably for Microsoft's Surface tablets and its Lumia line of smartphones.
The smartphone hypothesis makes no sense, as AMD's CPU and graphics IP doesn't appear to be targeted at smartphones, and good IP can be licensed from the likes of ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) and Imagination (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). AMD doesn't bring to the table any modem technology, either, which is critical for smartphones. If Microsoft were really interested building phone chips, AMD is hardly the go-to M&A target for that.
In tablets, such an acquisition might make a little more sense, since AMD brings to the table an X86 license. However, I don't think Microsoft has the scale with its Surface and Surface Pro line of systems to justify the huge R&D expense of trying to out-engineer Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) low-power X86 offerings.
This just doesn't sound plausible I'd say that this rumored acquisition is highly unlikely. As of writing, the rumor seems to be pushing the stock higher in after-hours trading, but I wouldn't be surprised if any buyout-rumor gains eventually evaporate -- as they have many times in the past.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has confirmed that it will finally be announcing its new slate of graphics cards on June 16. Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has had the high-end GPU market mostly to itself since launching the GTX 970 and GTX 980 last September at aggressive prices.
Just a couple of weeks before AMD's event, and just a couple of months after launching the powerful GTX Titan X, NVIDIA has once again disrupted the market with the GTX 980 Ti. The $649 graphics card is nearly as fast as the $999 Titan X, and it's capable of playing games at a 4K resolution. AMD's task of winning back market share just became more difficult.
A look at the GTX 980 Ti The eventual launch of a Ti variant of the GTX 980 was inevitable, but it is surprising that it came so soon after the launch of the Titan X. It's also surprising how close in performance the 980 Ti comes to the Titan X. While the 980 Ti sports about 8% fewer CUDA cores and texture units, and cuts the Titan X's 12GB of memory in half, real-world performance is very similar for both cards. Anandtech did a full review, and its conclusion was that there is only a 3% difference in performance between the two cards, despite the Titan X being priced $350 higher.

Source: NVIDIA
NVIDIA has essentially made the Titan X irrelevant, a bizarre move on the surface. But with AMD's new graphics cards on the way, NVIDIA likely wanted to be proactive. Instead of allowing AMD to launch a new high-end card at a lower price than the Titan X before launching a response, NVIDIA has come out swinging with the 980 Ti, putting pressure on AMD.
AMD has a problem There has been no shortage of rumors regarding AMD's upcoming graphics cards over the past few months. What we know is that the highest-end GPUs will sport high-bandwidth-memory, or HBM, which should give AMD's cards an advantage at the highest of resolutions. What we don't know is how much this new memory technology will add to the price of AMD's cards, or how it will ultimately perform compared to the new 980 Ti.
Some unofficial benchmarks of AMD's new high-end cards have leaked, showing that AMD's top new product performs about the same as the Titan X and the 980 Ti. That sounds about right, although we'll have to wait for official benchmarks to know for sure.
If AMD's highest-end GPU is in the same ballpark as the 980 Ti in terms of performance, the company is going to be unable to charge much more than $650. Previous rumors put the launch price of AMD's highest-end card at $899, which would likely be a non-starter given the 980 Ti's price, so my guess is that the card will ultimately launch at a lower price.
AMD is playing catch up to NVIDIA, and that puts the company in a difficult situation. NVIDIA has run away with the discrete GPU market in recent quarters, accounting for 76% of shipments during the fourth quarter of 2014, and AMD is going to have to blow away potential customers with its new products in order to win much of that market share back. Simply matching NVIDIA on performance is unlikely to turn things around for the company.
NVIDIA's strategy makes sense While essentially making the Titan X obsolete with the launch of the 980 Ti, NVIDIA has managed to back AMD into a corner. While NVIDIA had the freedom to sell a $1,000 high-end graphics card for months without any real competition, AMD has a hard limit on how much it can charge, assuming that the performance of its flagship card is similar to that of the 980 Ti.
We'll soon find out if AMD has any tricks up its sleeve, or if the company's adoption of HBM gives it an advantage. But at the moment, NVIDIA appears to be in control.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), better known as AMD, fell by $0.02, or less than 1%, in Tuesday's trading session, closing at $2.29. This was despite receiving a very bullish rating initiation from one Wall Street firm, which believes AMD's shares could more than double.
So what: Gus Richard, the covering analyst at Northland Capital, initiated coverage on AMD yesterday with an ""outperform"" rating (the equivalent of a ""buy"") and a price target of $5 per share. If AMD were to hit Richard's target, it would deliver a 118% return to shareholders.
Richard's bullish thesis amid a sea of skepticism surrounding AMD involves the expected growth of data centers and the reliance on x86-compatible chips. The only two companies that supply chips in this realm are chip-making powerhouse Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD. Because Richards believes that rewriting the software that's the backbone of today's data centers would take a lot of time and effort, he contends that x86 will ""continue to dominate the server market.""
Richard also believes that even if x86 loses its grasp in data centers in the U.S., AMD could be an attractive takeover target. Richard cites a number of possible suitors in his note to investors, including Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), Intel, and potentially a China-based company since China is heavily dependent on x86 processors.
Richard estimates that AMD could have about 10% market share in data center processors by 2017 (or about $1 billion in sales), which should lead to gross margin expansion and EPS of $0.50 for the full year.
Source: AMD via Facebook.
Now what: The real question that investors need to ask here is whether you trust Northland Capital's assessment or believe AMD is a dead duck.
On a fundamental basis it's tough to argue against the dead duck theory. AMD is in the midst of a multi-year businesses turnaround that continues to be pushed out by a weakening PC market and the heavy spending required to enter highly competitive next-generation product markets, such as the cloud, gaming, and data centers. Wall Street projects that AMD will lose money on an annual basis until 2017. However, unlike Richard's $0.50 EPS estimate for the full-year, Wall Street's consensus is a mere $0.03 profit.
However, playing second fiddle to Intel can have its perks, too. Even maintaining 10%-15% market share in data centers could net AMD substantial growth in the coming decade. Additionally, AMD has a growing presence in gaming consoles and has made significant headway in gaining microserver market share.
Personally, I've been weighing an investment in AMD for some time now, and I'm liking its potential for a turnaround. I would suggest that only those with a high tolerance for risk even consider investing in AMD, since it does have a number of competitive challenges yet to overcome. However, with new management in place and AMD targeting higher growth prospects, I suspect it's only a matter of time before the company puts its struggles firmly in the rearview mirror.

            ","The wait for new graphics cards from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is nearly over. After losing quite a bit of market share to rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past few quarters, AMD is expected to launch new products by the end of June. NVIDIA has had the high-end of the market mostly to itself after launching the GTX 970 and 980 last September, and the GTX Titan X in March -- AMD desperately needs to reclaim some market share.
But putting out competitive hardware will not be enough. A little more than one year ago, NVIDIA officially introduced GameWorks, a set of tools and code libraries that provide game developers with the ability to easily integrate advanced effects into their games. I wrote last year that GameWorks had the potential to give NVIDIA a competitive advantage in the GPU business. With the hoopla surrounding the recently released PC game, The Witcher 3, and its use of GameWorks, it appears as though that is exactly what's happening.
NVIDIA has a software advantage Software has always been important in the GPU business in the form of graphics drivers. This is the software that allows a PC to communicate with the GPU itself, and both AMD and NVIDIA continually update their drivers to work better with new and existing games.
However, you only have to look at the NVIDIA and AMD support websites to see that NVIDIA provides driver updates far more frequently. The latest official NVIDIA driver was released on May 18th, providing a variety of fixes and optimizations for The Witcher 3. On the other hand, the latest official AMD driver was released all the way back in December of last year, and its latest beta driver, which provided optimizations for Grand Theft Auto V, is more than a month old.
This discrepancy may simply be an issue of resources. AMD used to provide monthly driver updates, but it ended that practice back in 2012. This coincided with the beginning of a three-year streak of annual losses for the company, one which may turn into a four-year streak in 2015.
While NVIDIA and AMD routinely work with game developers to optimize games for their respective hardware, GameWorks takes things one step further. GameWorks provides code for advanced effects like soft shadows, high-quality skin shading, and the simulation and rendering of realistic hair and fur. These are all complicated and computationally intensive effects, and GameWorks saves developers from needing to reinvent the wheel.
GameWorks is obviously optimized to work best on NVIDIA hardware, and in certain cases, it works very poorly on AMD hardware. The Witcher 3 makes use of GameWorks' hair and fur rendering, and the developer has stated that it encourages users of AMD GPUs to disable the feature completely, because performance may be unacceptable due to the lack of optimizations with AMD hardware.
AMD is working on new beta drivers that fix these performance issues, but it may be too little, too late. GameWorks' hair and fur rendering was demoed in The Witcher 3 last year, so AMD had plenty of time to develop optimized drivers that were ready to go at launch. Again, a lack of resources compared to NVIDIA was likely the main issue.
What AMD needs to do New GPUs alone will not solve AMD's market share problems. GameWorks and other NVIDIA technologies are finding their way into an increasing number of PC games, and AMD needs to fight back with its own software. AMD's Mantle, the graphics API that the company developed as an alternative to DirectX, is now dead. Although it certainly influenced the development of DirectX 12, it did nothing to boost sales of AMD products, as I previously predicted.
AMD needs its own version of GameWorks. It needs to release optimized drivers at the same frequency as NVIDIA, and it needs to ensure that any performance issues are resolved before games are launched, not after. With AMD currently unprofitable and its resources spread across various businesses beyond graphics, catching up with NVIDIA on the software front will be a challenge, to say the least.

            ","Over the past few years, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has struggled with losing market share in the x86 and graphics chip markets against rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). To avoid directly competing against those two market leaders, AMD has expanded into smaller niche markets.
Two such markets are augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), which AMD highlighted as ""key drivers"" of future growth during its analyst day in early May. AMD stated that the AR and VR markets could grow from nearly nothing today to $150 billion by 2020, citing research firm Digi-Capital's estimates. 80% of that revenue is expected to come from AR devices, while the remaining 20% will be attributed to VR ones.

Source: AMD.
Will AMD really profit from that growth, or is it merely pegging its name to a hyped-up fledgling market?
Why AMD believes in AR and VRAMD believes it can naturally evolve its presence in the gaming industry into the AR and VR markets. AMD's APUs (advanced processing units) combine CPUs with GPUs (graphics processor units) on a single chip, making them ideal all-in-one solutions for devices that require heavy graphical processing horsepower. Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One -- the two top-selling eighth-generation gaming consoles -- both use AMD's semi-custom low-power APUs.
Therefore, Sony and Microsoft's upcoming AR/VR headsets will be directly powered by AMD's APUs if they're hooked up to consoles. In 2016, Sony will launch Project Morpheus, its VR headset for the PS4. Microsoft will also eventually launch HoloLens, an AR headset that overlays virtual objects onto real things, for Xbox One and Windows PCs.

Intel's HD Graphics and NVIDIA's Project Denver are also all-in-one APU chipsets, but neither one matches AMD's presence in console gaming.
A growing marketSony and Microsoft aren't the only companies expanding into the AR/VR market. Facebook is expected to launch its VR headset, Oculus Rift, in 2016. Google got developers interested in VR apps with its DIY Cardboard headset, then partnered with Mattel to transform its classic View-Master into a VR viewing device. Google also invested over half a billion dollars into Magic Leap, the developer of an AR headset that could potentially compete against HoloLens.

The arrival of those headsets will boost demand for beefier GPUs. However, some of them will need to be paired with mobile devices and PCs -- neither of which is AMD's forte. The mobile GPU market currently belongs to Qualcomm and Apple. Intel controls 72% of the overall GPU market, while NVIDIA controls 76% of the add-in graphics board market, according to research company JPR.
AMD's lack of GPU muscle in those markets could impact its ability to grow its AR/VR presence beyond gaming consoles. Moreover, there's no guarantee that Sony and Microsoft won't switch to NVIDIA or another chipmaker for APUs in future consoles.
Don't forget about the softwareHowever, AMD has an alternative way to infiltrate the VR market: software. In March, AMD unveiled LiquidVR, a suite of technologies designed to reduce delays, or latency, in VR image processing, which can cause motion sickness. The suite only works with VR content running on AMD hardware. Several major AR/VR partners, including Facebook's Oculus VR, are already integrating LiquidVR into their devices.
Until now, reducing latency was mainly considered a hardware issue. Last year, NVIDIA claimed its GeForce GTX 980 could reduce the Oculus Rift's latency by up to 50% in comparison to older cards. However, the GTX 980 is a top-tier card that costs $500-$600. Add that to the expected $200-$400 price tag for the Rift, and customers might have to pay $1,000 for an optimal VR experience.
With LiquidVR, VR applications might eventually run smoothly on cheaper graphics cards. The suite is also an early step toward a unified API for VR gaming, which could attract a lot more developers and vendors as the market matures.
Not a magic bulletThe AR/VR market is an exciting market to watch, but it's not a magic bullet to solve AMD's core problems.
Last quarter, revenue at both AMD's Computing & Graphics unit and its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) unit fell annually. The former posted an operating loss of $75 million, while the latter -- which houses AMD's higher-growth console and microserver SoCs -- stayed in the black, with an operating profit of $45 million. 
Rising sales of VR/AR devices might boost console sales, which could cast a halo effect on sales of PC-based add-in graphics boards. If the VR market matures and LiquidVR becomes an industry standard, AMD could possibly sell cheaper add-in graphics boards that can match the VR performance of pricier NVIDIA cards. 
Unfortunately, none of that will likely happen within the coming year. Until then, AMD must find other ways to get its top- and bottom-line growth back on track.

            ","During the past few years, Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) strategy has not made a lot of sense. The company has been trying to compete with Intel in both the PC and server chip markets, while at the same time facing off against NVIDIA in the GPU market, only to find itself losing market share across the board. On top of that, AMD has launched a variety of ambitious initiatives, despite the fact that its research and development spending has been slashed in each of the past three years.
Earlier this month, AMD held its 2015 Financial Analyst Day, and it seems that the company is finally taking the proper steps to narrow its focus and turn the business around. There are still no guarantees, and returning to profitability will be a difficult task, but it looks like AMD is finally doing something right.
Picking its spots During its financial analyst day presentation, AMD listed four recent challenges: a weak PC market, channel inventory, market share losses, and investments not being sufficiently focused. It is the last point that has caused most of AMD's problems. The company has been throwing its limited resources behind all sorts of initiatives, and this lack of focus has allowed the competition to continually win market share.
About a year ago, AMD announced Project SkyBridge, an initiative to create a single platform for both x86 and ARM CPUs. Project SkyBridge is now dead, and the company's custom K12 ARM core has been delayed to 2017. These decisions are likely for the best: Project SkyBridge was too ambitious for AMD, and with the ARM server market still in its nascent stages, rushing a custom ARM core to market makes little sense.
Along with scaling back its ARM ambitions, AMD is exiting its SeaMicro dense server business. AMD acquired SeaMicro in 2012 for $334 million in an attempt to take advantage of the growth in micro-servers. However, as CEO Lisa Su stated during the latest conference call, the market has not developed fast enough, and AMD's core competency is processors, not systems. That is $334 million wasted and a costly lesson learned.
The most important part of its new strategy isn't where the company is focusing but where the company isn't focusing. AMD is not going after the smartphone market or the low-end tablet market, and it is reducing its exposure to the low-end of the PC market. And while the Internet of Things is expected to be a huge opportunity in the coming years, the company will not be putting its chips into IoT endpoints such as smartwatches and smart appliances.
These decisions are the right ones. There is simply no way that AMD can compete in these markets against Intel and companies making ARM chips. Intel barely has a presence in smartphones today, and it had to heavily subsidize its tablet chips to gain market share. That is despite Intel spending billions maintaining its state-of-the-art fabrication facilities and outspending AMD on research and development by more than a factor of 10.
The plan to win market share The key to the new CPU strategy is Zen, the new high-performance core expected to launch in 2016. AMD is now focusing on the high-end of the PC market. With Intel currently facing essentially no competition there, it is likely the best opportunity to win back some PC market share. Zen is also the key to AMD's server strategy, and the company hopes to gain server market share starting in 2017.
With Zen, AMD has switched to using simultaneous multithreading -- what Intel calls Hyper-Threading. In its previous CPU architecture, AMD used a different form of multithreading, and this contributed to its lackluster performance compared to Intel chips. Zen should help close the performance gap.
In the GPU market, AMD has been losing market share to NVIDIA for the past few quarters, but the company plans to launch new GPUs in the next few months. These will be the first to use high-bandwidth memory, which should give the new cards an advantage when it comes to gaming at 4K resolutions. NVIDIA will likely launch some new GPUs in response, so there is again no guarantee that AMD will be able to regain ground in the market.
AMD is still going to have a tough time winning market share in the CPU and GPU markets, but for the first time in years, its strategy make sense. The company no longer appears to be flailing, pushing all sorts of initiatives and trying to compete on multiple fronts. Instead, AMD is starting to focus on the areas where it has the best chance at being competitive, and that should be a welcome development for investors.

            ","Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have fallen 43% over the past 12 months. Its core CPU and GPU businesses were respectively marginalized by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA, which caused AMD's average selling prices to fall across the board. A slowdown in the PC market exacerbated that pain.
Last quarter, AMD reported a net loss of $180 million, compared to a loss of $20 million a year earlier. Revenue plunged 26% year over year to $1.03 billion. Although many investors believe there's not much value left in AMD stock, let's take a contrarian view and discuss three ways the chipmaker could save itself.
1. Expanding into Chromebooks and IoT chipsAMD hasn't made chips for Chromebooks or Internet of Things, or IoT, devices, while Intel has embraced both high-growth markets. Research firm Gartner expects Chromebooks to claim 4.3% of the PC market by 2017, up from 1.5% in 2014. IDC expects the total IoT market to grow from $1.9 trillion in 2013 to $7.1 trillion by 2020.

Chromebooks. Source: Google.
AMD's reasoning was the same for both: it didn't want to weigh down its bottom line with low-margin products. Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster called Chromebooks a ""rock-bottom"" market at the ISSCC conference in February. In January, AMD's since-departed computing and graphics chief John Byrne told VentureBeat that he wasn't ""in the business to lose money"" when it came to selling IoT chips.
Yet by avoiding both markets, AMD ignores two key facts. Selling low-margin chips would still generate fresh revenue growth. Considering that AMD's computing and graphics revenue plunged 38% annually last quarter, it wouldn't be a terrible idea. Second, it ignores economies of scale: if AMD can sell low margin products at sufficiently high volumes, the cost per unit could drop.
AMD probably isn't confident that it can sell enough Chromebook or IoT chips to bring those costs down. If it failed to do so, the unit's operating loss -- which already stood at $75 million last quarter -- could widen. Nonetheless, AMD shouldn't prematurely dismiss those two opportunities for growth.
2. Spinning off its computing and graphics divisionConsidering how poorly the computing and graphics division has fared, it might be wise to spin off or sell the unit. After all, the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom, or EESC, unit generates plenty of revenue on its own:
1Q Revenue
YOY growth
% of 1Q Revenue
Computing & Graphics
$532 million
(38%)
52%
EESC
$498 million
(7%)
48%
Source: AMD quarterly earnings report.
Moreover, AMD's EESC business remains profitable, although its operating income fell 47% year over year to $45 million last quarter. The EESC business is mainly propped up by sales of system-on-chips for Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4, but it has also expanded into microservers, which IDC forecasts will account for 10% of all servers by 2016.
Unfortunately, AMD recently shuttered its SeaMicro brand of microservers, which were considered a potential showcase for its new ARM-based processors. Other microserver makers could still install AMD's ARM-based processors in their microservers, but there are already plenty of other ARM-based microserver chipmakers in that field, such as Texas Instruments. 
If AMD sells its computing and graphics division, it could invest that cash back into strengthening its EESC business. However, the EESC unit might be too dependent on IP from the Computing and Graphics segment, and the two businesses could be too tightly intertwined to be separated. Moreover, if AMD becomes even smaller, it could lose whatever pricing power it has left in the market.  
3. Sell itself to mobile chipmakersTherefore, a better option would be for AMD to shop itself around to potential buyers. With a market cap of just $1.8 billion, AMD could be easily acquired by a larger chipmaker such as Samsung or Qualcomm.

Both companies, which make ARM-based chips, would benefit from acquiring AMD's license to manufacture x86 chips. That could help either one expand from mobile devices and into Intel's core market of laptops and desktops.
However, it's not that simple. Any company that buys AMD would also inherit the company's $2.3 billion in debt. AMD also had a negative free cash flow of $163 million over the past 12 months, and has less than $1 billion in cash and short-term holdings. Meanwhile, both of its business units are posting negative top- and bottom-line growth.
The takeawayAMD isn't a safe stock by any means. These three lifesaving strategies are long shots that might never happen. However, they offer valuable insights into AMD's previous business decisions, and highlight the value that might remain in its core businesses.

            ","Chipmakers AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have certainly seen better days. Shares of AMD have fallen over 40% in the past 12 months, while shares of Qualcomm are down over 10%. On the other hand, Intel -- which competes against AMD in x86 CPUs and Qualcomm in mobile chips -- is up nearly 25%. 
However, bottom-fishing investors might be wondering if AMD or Qualcomm make good contrarian picks. Let's take a look at both companies to see which one is a better ""bad news buy.""
AMD: Stuck between two giantsA decade ago, AMD realized that it could not compete directly against Intel and its dominant market share in x86 chips. As a result, AMD acquired graphics card maker ATI in 2006 to diversify its top line with high-end graphics cards and APUs. But between the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2014, Nvidia increased its market share of add-in graphic boards from 65% to 76%, according to research firm JPR. AMD saw its share fall from 35% to 24%.
To avoid being crushed between Intel and Nvidia, AMD focused on strengthening its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) segment, which includes server and embedded processors, SoC products, engineering services, and royalties. The EESC unit received a major boost when Microsoft and Sony put its SoCs in the Xbox One and PS4, respectively.

As a result, the EESC unit grew as its CPU and GPU businesses faded. But as investors saw during the first quarter, growth in the EESC unit is also slowing down:

Average selling prices fell across the board. As a result, the computing and graphics unit posted an operating loss of $75 million, down from a profit of $3 million a year earlier. Operating income at EESC plunged 47% year-over-year to $45 million.
Qualcomm: an existential crisisQualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of mobile SoCs and wireless modems in the world. That puts it in a solid position to profit from the growth of the smartphone industry, but it also has a glaring weakness: Qualcomm depends on Apple and Samsung for roughly half of its revenue.
In the past, Qualcomm provided the wireless modem for Apple iPhones, and SoCs and wireless modems for Samsung flagship Galaxy devices. But both companies are now moving to cut Qualcomm silicon out of their handsets. Apple will reportedly use its own wireless modem or an Intel one in a variant of its next iPhone. Samsung replaced Qualcomm Snapdragon processors with its own Exynos SoC in its latest S6 handsets and installed its own Shannon wireless modem. 
Samsung has its own chipmaking business which is also a threat to Qualcomm. Samsung, Apple, and Qualcomm all license mobile chip designs from ARM Holdings. But unlike either company, Samsung has a foundry which accepts manufacturing contracts from other OEMs. Apple, for example, recently contracted Samsung to manufacture its upcoming A9 chips. Meanwhile, the Samsung Exynos processor has found its way into other smartphones from Meizu and ZTE, which both also use Qualcomm chips.

In response, Qualcomm shifted its focus toward emerging markets with ""turnkey"" solutions for smaller OEMs. These package deals let OEMs bundle Qualcomm hardware and software together, which reduces the development and manufacturing costs of new phones. However, the pricing power that came with that strategy was considered anticompetitive in China, which resulted in a $975 million fine last year. That fine caused net income to plunge 46% year-over-year last quarter.
Qualcomm does not expect things to improve anytime soon. It recently slashed its full year revenue and earnings outlook, blaming Apple and Samsung for those adjustments.

The winner: QualcommIt is tough to pick between two losers, but Qualcomm is a safer bad news buy for three reasons.
First, Qualcomm is still profitable. The fine in China took a bite out of its GAAP earnings, but excluding that charge, its non-GAAP net income rose 4% annually last quarter. AMD was not profitable on any basis last quarter. Second, Qualcomm stock is relatively cheap at 14 times earnings, compared to the S&P 500 average price-to-earnings of 21 times and the industry trailing average of 48 times. 
Third, Qualcomm could bounce back if it diversifies its top line away from Apple and Samsung. Moreover, the commoditization of the smartphone market -- which harms those leading players -- is a positive development for Qualcomm, since it means smaller OEMs will require turnkey solutions. AMD, however, does not have an easy way to diversify away from its core businesses. Lastly, Qualcomm pays a respectable 2.9% dividend and has raised it for 11 straight years. There is little chance AMD will ever pay a dividend.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently reported its first quarter earnings, and they were ugly. The PC segment continued to collapse, with revenue from CPUs and GPUs falling by 38% year-over-year. The Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment, which includes AMD's game console business, shrunk as well, with revenue falling by 7% and operating profit nearly cut in half.
AMD doesn't expect things to get better anytime soon. The company has guided for a 3% sequential decline in total revenue during the second quarter, equivalent to a 30% year-over-year decline. The second half of this year may prove to be a bit better for AMD, with new graphics cards expected to launch in June, but big revenue declines are still likely, as are continued losses.
With AMD burning cash as it attempts to turn around its business, how long does the company have before bankruptcy becomes a real possibility?
A painful decline AMD still had about $900 million in cash and investments at the end of the first quarter, and the company has done a good job at maintaining a sizable cash balance despite its poor results. AMD has taken a few steps over the past few years to prevent its cash balance from falling too low. In 2013, the company sold its campus in Austin, Texas and leased it back, raising about $164 million in the process.
AMD has also slashed its capital expenditures, spending just $95 million in 2014 compared to $250 million in 2011. It's difficult to say for sure, but AMD may be underspending on capex in an effort to conserve cash, given that the company's depreciation expense was twice its capital expenditures in 2014. While this helps the situation in the short-term, it's unlikely to be sustainable in the long-run.
Here's how some key balance sheet figures have changed from 2010 to 2014:

AMD has managed to avoid taking on additional debt, and in fact has reduced its debt slightly over the past five years. But the book value of the company has plummeted, and after the first quarter, AMD is on the cusp of having a negative book value.
The balance sheet may not look all that concerning, given the big cash balance and the steady levels of debt, but things have actually gotten quite a bit worse over the past five years. The Altman Z-Score, a number calculated from various items on a company's balance sheet, is a useful way to determine whether a company is at risk of going bankrupt. A Z-Score below 1.81 means that the company is likely headed toward bankruptcy within the next few years.
Here's how AMD's Z-Score has evolved from 2010 to 2014:

In 2010, AMD's Z-Score indicated that it was distressed, but barely so. Since then, the Z-Score has plummeted, turning negative in 2014. The Altman Z-Score is a far from perfect metric, but it does help show that AMD's balance sheet has truly deteriorated over the past five years.
A few years left Despite the bleakness of AMD's balance sheet, the good news is that AMD has until 2019 before it has to repay any significant portion of its outstanding debt, with $600 million worth of notes maturing that year. This buys AMD some time to turn things around before it needs to refinance that debt.
The problem is that the deterioration of AMD's business doesn't seem to be slowing down. First quarter results were awful by any measure, much worse compared to the first quarter of 2014, and the second quarter won't be any better.
Delays are starting to plague the company, not surprising given that research and development spending has been slashed continually over the past few years. AMD's 64-bit ARM server chips, supposed to be the savior of AMD's languishing server business, have been pushed back to the second half of this year, one year later than initially planned. Meanwhile, AMD's upcoming discrete graphics cards are now expected sometime in June. Competitor NVIDIA has had the high-end of the market essentially to itself since last September when it launched the GTX 970 and 980, and AMD has yet to respond with anything at all.
There's no real threat that AMD goes bankrupt in the next few years -- the company has plenty of cash remaining and no major debt repayments coming up. But that cash balance will continue to dwindle as AMD tries to remain competitive in too many markets with too few resources, battling Intel and NVIDIA simultaneously. By the time 2019 rolls around, AMD's financial position will likely be even more precarious than it is today. If the company hasn't come up with some sort of strategy to return to profitability by then, bankruptcy will become very likely, if not inevitable.

            ","Following struggling chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) weak earnings and forward guidance, Barron's reported that Jeffries analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated the stock as a ""Buy"" and maintained his $4 price target, representing a nearly 40% upside from current levels.
Lipacis argued that AMD has ""great [intellectual property],"" citing x86, ARM, graphics, and server-fabric technologies as examples of such ""great"" intellectual property. He also reportedly says that AMD just needs a ""plan to monetize it.""
To be perfectly blunt, I disagree on the value of this IP. Here is why.
If the IP is so valuable, why are AMD products losing market share? The simple question that investors should ask about this allegedly ""valuable IP"": If the IP is so valuable, why do AMD products continue to lose market share?
It is well-known that AMD x86 processors are simply outclassed by the competition. Intel processors are known to offer both higher performance and more power efficiency than comparable AMD offerings. This is likely one of the main reasons that Intel keeps on taking substantial market share from AMD in x86 processors.
In graphics processors, it is the same old story -- NVIDIA products deliver better performance-per-watt than their AMD counterparts, which has helped the former gain significant market share, particularly in gaming notebooks.
AMD is still developing products based on its internally designed ARM core, so it is hard to make any assessment of the relative worth of this particular piece of intellectual property.
Finally, the same question needs to be asked about AMD server fabric technology: if it is so great, why isn't AMD out making money with it? I believe the fabric in question actually came to AMD as part of its acquisition of SeaMicro -- you know, the acquisition that AMD just took a writedown on and shuttered.
Another reason AMD IP might not be worth all that much The big growth markets for CPUs and graphics -- the IP that some assert is so valuable -- are the low-power and mobile markets as well as the networking and server markets.
In mobile, ARM has a whole suite of CPUs, graphics cores, and video processors. This IP is also quite good, which is why it is so broadly adopted.
Imagination also licenses CPU cores (MIPS) and graphics/media (PowerVR). Its graphics IP is also known to be top-notch -- the company reports that it is seeing ""record royalties"" for its MIPS CPU cores, implying that this IP is competitive. 
It is just hard to see a lot of value in the AMD IP portfolio given how rich the current semiconductor intellectual property landscape is. 
The best way for AMD to ""monetize"" its IP I do not think that IP makes AMD valuable enough as an acquisition target given that good IP can be licensed for cheap. The best way for AMD to ""monetize"" this portfolio is to make competitive chips based on said IP.
The fact that AMD is losing market share in both PC processors and graphics, and has essentially no presence in servers, tells me everything I need to know about the true value of its current IP portfolio.

            ","Back in February 2012, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announced that it would acquire microserver vendor SeaMicro to ""accelerate"" its ""disruptive server strategy."" The company paid a whopping $334 million for the company, with $281 million of that paid in cash.
Just three years later, AMD announced during its first quarter 2015 report that it would be pulling the proverbial plug on this venture and taking a $75 million writedown in the process. On the most recent earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su said that the micro-server market ""[has] not developed at the pace we might have thought a couple of years ago.""
Su also pointed out that AMD's ""core competency is really in processors and being able to service that business through either standard or semicustom products."" In other words, AMD -- a chip vendor -- thinks that it should just stick to selling chips.
What a terrible waste Perhaps the most frustrating part of this for AMD shareholders must be the fact that AMD paid $281 million in cold hard cash for this acquisition. It would be one thing if AMD were generating robust levels of cash year-in and year-out, but as you can see from the table below, AMD's cash flow situation since early 2012 has been pretty bad:

Source: YCharts
The worst part of this is that AMD has over $2 billion in debt to service, but only a little over $900 million in cash on hand. The company would have been better served plowing that $281 million in cash into paying off some of its relatively high interest debt.
Speaking of servers ... AMD's server processor share has plunged so much in recent years that it's a stretch to say that the company is even ""competing"" in this market right now. Aside from a few rebranded PC processors, as well as an ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH)based server chip that has perpetually been stuck in the ""sampling"" phase (to be fair, Su says that this chip -- known as Seattle -- should generate revenue in the second half of this year), AMD hasn't released new chips aimed at the server market in years.
AMD CEO Lisa Su talked about how the company is investing in developing new server chips in a bid to regain share, but I'm very skeptical that the company can even succeed at this point. AMD's larger rival, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), has said that it spends $2 billion per year in data center related research and development.
That's more than twice AMD's yearly research and development budget.
In addition, Intel has a strong base of products, architectures, and customer relationships from which to build off of; AMD not only needs to use its much smaller research and development budget to make up for lost time, but it then needs to be able to consistently invest so that its products remain competitive year in, year out.
This doesn't seem realistic to me.
It'll be interesting to see what AMD has to say in May AMD made sure to let investors know that it will be hosting a financial analyst day on May 6. I am very interested to see what AMD's long-term strategy with respect to the server market. In particular, I'm interested in seeing what particular segments of the overall server market AMD will focus on, and what sort of financials the company expects in the medium and long term.

            ","Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were down 14.1% as of 10:48 a.m. Friday after the company announced disappointing first-quarter results.
So what: Quarterly revenue fell 26% year over year to $1.03 billion, which translated to an adjusted net loss of $73 million, or $0.09 per share. Analysts, on average, were looking for a much narrower loss of $0.05 per share on higher revenue of $1.05 billion.
Even so, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said: ""Building great products, driving deeper customer relationships and simplifying our business remain the right long-term steps to strengthen AMD and improve our financial performance.""
Now what: For now, Su elaborated, that means focusing ""on improving our near-term financial results and delivering a stronger second half of the year based on completing our work to rebalance channel inventories and shipping strong new products.""
For the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to decrease 3% sequentially, plus or minus 3% -- or a range of roughly $0.97 billion to $1.03 billion. Analysts were modeling sequential quarterly growth in revenue of 9.7% to $1.13 billion.
In the end, it's hard to blame the market for bidding shares of AMD down today given both its modest quarterly miss and lighter-than-expected guidance. Until AMD can show some tangible progress toward achieving its goal of sustained profitability -- which starts with improved financial results in the second half of the year -- I fear long investors will likely endure more pain going forward.

            ","Fellow Fool Leo Sun recently published a write-up discussing why chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is not actively targeting the market for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chromebooks. Leo pointed to a quote from an AMD executive, who reportedly said that Chromebooks are a ""rock-bottom market"" with unattractive margins.
This might be true for AMD, but in my view, it has very little to do with anything inherent to the Chromebook market itself. AMD's apparent inability to compete for good margins in the Chromebook market seems to be a company-specific problem. Allow me to explain.
Intel is making bank from Chromebooks at good margins Over the past several years, AMD's gross profit margins have plunged. In the last 12 months, the gross profit margin percentage came out to just 33.4%, down from the low 40% range the company had enjoyed in years past. This performance stands in stark contrast to rival Intel(NASDAQ:INTC), which has seen gross profit margins of over 63% during the same period. 
Although one could rightfully attribute those very high gross profit margins to its data-center chips, note that last year, the Intel PC Client Group recorded an operating margin of over 42%. That means gross profit margins for that division, since Intel spends heavily on research and development, were significantly above that level.
Yet Intel sells lots of chips into Chromebooks and Chromebook-class laptops.
Low-cost does not always mean low-margin There is a fundamental concept that investors need to understand: Low prices do not necessarily mean low margins. The gross profit margin percentage does not just depend on the selling prices of its products but the costs to manufacture those products as well.
For example, if I sell a chip for $1.00, but it costs me just $0.30 to manufacture it, then my gross profit margin percentage on that chip is a very respectable 70%. Conversely, if I sell a chip for $1,000, but it costs me $750 to manufacture it, then my gross profit margin percentage on that chip is just 25%.
Where I think the confusion comes from is that low-cost chips, even with high per-chip gross profit margin percentages, do not generate as much in gross profit dollars per unit. However, that is why it is always important to factor volume into the equation to get a picture of the total gross profit.
With that out of the way, let's get back to AMD, Intel, and Chromebooks.
Intel margins on Chromebooks are quite high The chips that Intel typically sells into Chromebooks are either very feature-reduced Core processors sold under the ""Pentium"" and ""Celeron"" brands, or they are Atom-derived chips sold under those same brands.
Now, Intel has said that the majority of its Pentium and Celeron chips have been moved to the Atom architecture, because this lowers the company cost structure for said chips. Furthermore, Intel has indicated that over 20% of all of the chips it sells into laptop PCs are based on the Atom architecture.
So why is Intel able to make good money selling low-cost PC chips? 
It is about cost structure, and potentially competitiveness I believe the real reason AMD does not want to take Intel on in devices such as Chromebooks is that it simply does not have the cost structure to compete. Intel just announced that it is shipping low-cost, low-power chips known as Braswell for the low-cost PC market based on its 14-nanometer technology.
AMD's Carrizo-L, which is expected to compete with Braswell, is also expected to ship in the first half of 2015. However, there are a couple of things worth noting. Not only does AMD need to pay an external chip manufacturer to build its products (putting it at a disadvantage to Intel right off the bat), but AMD's chips also do not seem to target the same power envelope.
For some context, Carrizo-L, according to the AMD website, is targeted at a 10 to 25-watt power envelope. Braswell, on the other hand, targets a 6-watt ""thermal design power"" and a 4-watt ""scenario design power."" These chips are not even close to the same league in terms of power consumption.
That means low-cost Braswell chips can be used to power cheap, fanless Chromebooks. I am not convinced that the current AMD product lineup is well suited to address this opportunity.

            ","AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) cheap x86 microprocessors seem like a natural match for Chromebooks, the low-end laptops tethered to Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cloud-based ecosystem. 
Yet AMD isn't interested in developing chips for Chromebooks, according to CTO Mark Papermaster, who called Chromebooks a ""rock-bottom"" market at the ISSCC conference in February. Is shunning Chromebooks that the right strategy for AMD, or is it missing out on a lucrative growth market?

Chromebooks. Source: Google
The business of ChromebooksIDC estimates that Global sales of Chromebooks roughly doubled to 4.6 million shipments in 2014, but only accounted for 1.5% of the PC market.
However, Gartner believes that annual Chromebook sales will soar to 14.2 million units by 2017, accounting for 4.3% of the PC market. By comparison, Gartner expects annual shipments of all PCs, including Chromebooks, to only rise 4.3% to 327.3 million units between 2014 and 2017. Based on those numbers, establishing a toehold in Chromebooks might help AMD offset sluggish PC sales.
Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Celeron chips power roughly three-fourths of all Chromebooks, according to Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron. The remainder runs on ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) licensed designs. This duopoly means that AMD would need to undercut both Intel and ARM licensees to enter the Chromebook market -- which could be rough on margins.
Are AMD's chips too powerful?The problem with Chromebooks is that they're designed for light usage, such as Web browsing, office work, and video streaming. These tasks don't require a lot of graphical horsepower.
AMD, which acquired graphics card maker ATI in 2006, specializes in APUs which combine the CPU's processing power with the GPU's graphical muscle. Carrizo, its upcoming notebook SoC, pairs four x86 CPU cores with eight GPU cores -- which is arguably more power than any Chrome OS user would ever need. 
Yet AMD's Mullins, the low-power APU that it introduced last year, seems like a good fit for Chromebooks. The chip, originally intended for tablets, was installed in cheap Windows laptops like Hewlett-Packard's $230 Stream 14 last year.
Why margins matterIt seems odd that AMD didn't pit Mullins against the Celeron in the Chromebook market, but the margins, as Papermaster suggested, probably aren't worth the effort.
AMD is still on the path set by former CEO Rory Read, who shifted the company toward higher-margin businesses, like the embedded, server, and semicustom unit, which sells SoCs for Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. That strategy helped AMD grow its top line, reduce operating expenses, and narrow its non-GAAP losses.
Part of that strategy, which current CEO Lisa Su is continuing, is to avoid head-on battles against Intel. Intel has much more cash to spend on marketing, and isn't shy about taking losses to gain or retain market share. For example, Intel's mobile unit posted an operating loss of $4.2 billion due to its aggressive subsidization of tablet and smartphone makers. With Chromebooks, Intel sells low-margin Celerons to prevent ARM licensees from gaining ground in the PC market.
Will the Chromebook Pixel change AMD's mind?Chromebooks don't require much GPU power, but future models might. Last month, Google unveiled the second-generation Chromebook Pixel, a high-end Chromebook that starts at $999. The device sports a 2.6 Ghz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. For graphics, the Pixel uses Intel HD Graphics 5500, an integrated graphics card which can play most modern PC games on low graphics settings.

There's not much of a market now for the Pixel, since Chrome apps don't demand much CPU or GPU performance. However, Google is making select Android apps compatible with Chrome OS, which means that graphically demanding Android games could be natively played on Chromebooks soon. That cross-platform compatibility might encourage other OEMs to manufacture high-end Chromebooks with beefier GPUs, which would be a more favorable market for Carrizo.
The bottom lineAMD's distaste for the Chromebook market makes sense, because it doesn't want to ruin its margins competing against Intel and ARM in a ""rock bottom"" market. But if the Chromebook market continues growing and evolves toward higher-end devices like the Pixel, an opportunity for APUs like Carrizo might emerge.

            ","The tech industry has seen some of the most significant and largest acquisitions in corporate history.
Below are five of the biggest -- in some cases in terms of dollars spent, in others, in terms of their significance. Whether it was a larger firm absorbing a start-up that later defined its business, or a tech giant absorbing an established rival, these acquisitions have all helped to define the current tech landscape.
Google buys AndroidGoogle (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has made many prescient acquisitions over the years -- YouTube in 2006, Applied Semantics in 2003 -- but its acquisition of Android may have been the most significant. When Google purchased Android back in 2005, few people had ever heard of Andy Rubin's start-up. In terms of a raw dollar figure, the deal was rather insignificant (an estimated $50 million), but the resulting effects have been so notable (a Google executive later termed it ""its best deal ever"") that the purchase deserves its place on this list.
Today, Android is one of the largest operating systems in the world, with around 1 billion active users, and a dominant share of the mobile market -- the overwhelming majority of smartphones and tablets sold worldwide run Google's operating system.
Google doesn't profit from Android directly (it gives it away for free) but Android serves as a tapestry for Google's services, allowing it to push its products like Maps, search, and Gmail onto its many mobile users.
Apple acquires Steve Jobs' NeXTLike Google's purchase of Android, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquisition of NeXT in late 1996 wasn't the largest in terms of dollars -- it cost just $400 million. But if it hadn't happened, Apple probably wouldn't be in business today, let alone be the world's largest company.
The purchase of NeXT brought Steve Jobs back to Apple, and set the stage for the company's resurgence. Technologies developed at NeXT form the backbone of what are arguably Apple's two most important products: its operating systems. Both OS X (Mac) and iOS (iPhone, iPad) were built on technologies developed at NeXT, and Apple's exclusive use of these operating systems sets its products apart from competitors.
AMD gets into graphics with ATIBoth Android and NeXT are, in hindsight, wildly successful acquisitions. The success of semiconductor giant AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) 2006 purchase of graphics maker ATI, however, is a bit less clear.
For $5.4 billion, AMD entered the graphics market, buying what was then one of the top dedicated graphics card designers. At the time, AMD was coming off one of its most successful quarters ever (in terms of processor market share) and executives argued that the combination would allow the company to take even market share from Intel, as it could court PC OEMs with a combination of AMD processors and ATI graphics chips.
It's not clear if the merger was a significant contributor, but AMD's business has definitely gone downhill since acquisition, and its current market cap (about $2 billion) is less than half of what it paid for ATI. In the graphics card market, Nvidia has surged ahead of AMD, while Intel completely dominates the PC processor market.
Hewlett-Packard merges with CompaqHewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) $25 billion purchase of rival PC-maker Compaq is, like AMD's purchase of ATI, fairly controversial.
The purchase did create a PC behemoth -- Hewlett-Packard is, to this day, one of the largest PC vendors in the world. But it may have tarnished Hewlett-Packard's culture and focus. Shareholders have certainly suffered. Since it announced the acquisition in September, 2001, Hewlett-Packard shares are up around 103% on a total return basis. The S&P 500, however, is up more than 138%.

^SPXTR data by YCharts
To be fair, other tech behemoths -- including both Microsoft and IBM -- have done even worse for their shareholders (returning about 102% and 91%, respectively) but Hewlett-Packard has largely wallowed in mediocrity since the acquisition, going through a string of CEOs and several failed attempts at transformation -- a sharp contrast to its massive success in the 1990s.
The merger is even more interesting considering the fact that it was opposed by board member Walter Hewlett, son of Bill Hewlett, the co-founder of the company. Hewlett led a proxy battle in an attempt to block the merger, but was ultimately unsuccessful.
AOL buys Time WarnerThe merger of AOL (NYSE:AOL) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) was one of the largest in history. In total, AOL spent about $162 billion to acquire the media giant, creating a corporate colossus that was supposed to -- at least in theory -- dominate the Internet. With Time Warner's networks and cable assets, and AOL's Internet service, the mashup appeared to hold great potential. The combined company may have been able to dictate the flow of media and advertising in the United States.
Unfortunately, it is widely regarded as a disaster. In 2009, it came to an end, with Time Warner spinning AOL off. It also divested its cable company (Time Warner Cable) and later, its magazine publishing arm, Time, Inc. Although the share price of all the firms has rallied since the split, the market cap of all four firms combined (around $120 billion) remains a far cry from AOL-Time Warner's once enormous $350 billion valuation.

            ","Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) must ""face claims that it committed securities fraud"" in ""hiding problems"" with the launch of a chip code-named Llano, according to Reuters. 
AMD reportedly told investors it would deliver ample supply of Llano chips beginning in the second quarter of 2011. The reality, according to Reuters, was that the company faced supply constraints. To make matters worse, by the time AMD worked through its production issues, demand for those chips had dried up. This is a fast-moving sector, after all.
Then, in an earnings warning in October 2012, AMD said it would take a writedown on $100 million worth of Llano inventory that it simply couldn't move. Reuters reported that, as a result of this alleged deception, the plaintiffs seek damages for investors who purchased AMD stock ""between April 2011 and October 2012.""
The huge fall in AMD's share price According to Reuters, the plaintiffs allege that AMD's stock fell by 74% from March 2012 to October 2012 due to the market learning about the severity of the Llano supply situation.
While the $100 million inventory writedown unquestionably cost shareholders, I'm not at all convinced the stock-price drop from $8.35 to $2.18 had much, if anything, to do with the Llano situation.
Let's dig a little bit deeper, shall we?
AMD in 2012 Here's a chart of AMD's stock price during 2012:

Source: Google Finance.
Notice how things were going pretty well until the shares started sliding around late March/early April? Well, during this time, AMD likely didn't face supply constraints on Llano, and by April 2012 it had even begun shipping Llano's follow-on, known as Trinity.
In my view, the biggest problem facing the company in 2012 was a weakening PC market: Both AMD and larger rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported declines in their respective PC-related revenue for the year.
In July 2012, AMD pre-announced that revenue for the second quarter of the year would be down 11% sequentially. The previous forecast had been for a 3% decline.
Then, when AMD finally reported results for the second quarter, the company said it expected revenue to ""decrease 1% sequentially +/- 3%."" That was not so great (the second half of the year is supposed to be seasonally up), but things got worse when AMD negatively pre-announced again.
During that pre-announcement, AMD said revenue would drop 10% sequentially, instead of just 1%. The chipmaker also said it would take the $100 million inventory writedown related to the Llano chips.
The writedown wasn't why AMD stock plunged Whether AMD shaded the truth regarding the Llano supply situation or not, I think, has little to do with the painful share price decline in 2012. AMD's shares had already taken a beating well before management announced the writedown.
I believe the share price declines both before the writedown and after were due to a much weaker than expected PC market, coupled with very aggressive competition from Intel as it fought to stabilize its own PC chip shipments in a tough market.
Finally, for a more visual illustration of why the inventory writedown was hardly a major driver of AMD's stock loss, look at the following chart:

Source: Google Finance.
Intel, which derives most of its revenue and profits from PC chip sales, experienced a very similar trend in its share price during 2012. Now, the decline wasn't as steep (AMD is a far more volatile stock, and that volatility cuts both ways) but the directions were roughly the same.

            ","A little while ago, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) made it clear to the industry that it wanted to monetize its graphics patent war chest. This has led some to suggest that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), the other major vendor of high-performance standalone graphics, could potentially follow suit.
Indeed, on Twitter, Justin Jaynes made a very interesting point in response to my claim that Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) could simply poach graphics talent rather than buy the entire company -- he said that while Samsung could poach engineers, it cannot poach patents.
To that end, I decided to do some digging to try to get a sense of the relative value of AMD's graphics patent portfolio relative to that of other players in the industry.
Here is what NVIDIA says At an investor presentation this year, NVIDIA shared the following slide:

Source: NVIDIA
NVIDIA claims that it has over 600 ""fundamental graphics patents"" while its peers tend to have far fewer. Interestingly enough, it appears that if Samsung were to acquire AMD (as some have suggested), this would approximately double its ""fundamental graphics patent"" portfolio. Still smaller than NVIDIA, but this might, as has been suggested, help it better defend against NVIDIA's patent lawsuit.
What would Samsung have to pay if it wanted those patents? If Samsung were to outright buy AMD today for, say, a 50% premium to the current market capitalization, this would imply a purchase price of $3 billion. After factoring in the net debt position, Samsung would wind up paying a tad over $4 billion.
In that case, would it make financial sense for Samsung to pick up AMD just for its graphics patents?
Licensing NVIDIA patents might be cheaper You might recall that Intel wound up paying NVIDIA $1.5 billion over the course of six years as part of what is essentially a cross-licensing agreement (to read more about the Intel-NVIDIA deal, I recommend checking out the AnandTech article here).
At any rate, the deal between NVIDIA and Intel seemed to essentially boil down to Intel needing access to NVIDIA graphics patents in order to continue to build its own graphics processors into its PC chips.
My guess is that if Samsung has to, it could simply license NVIDIA's patent portfolio for significantly less than it would need to pay to buy AMD. Intel is paying NVIDIA $264 million per year in a deal worth $1.5 billion. Even if Samsung had to pay NVIDIA the same annual rate, it makes sense to just license the patents.
It will be interesting to see how the NVIDIA-Samsung situation plays out This whole discussion has come about because NVIDIA recently sued Samsung, claiming that the chips Samsung includes in its phones (which usually have Qualcomm or ARM designed graphics processors) infringe upon NVIDIA's fundamental patents.
As per the slide above, NVIDIA says the ITC hearing with respect to this case will happen in late June and that a decision is set to come in early October. I am very interested to see how this all plays out and what NVIDIA's patent portfolio is deemed to be ""worth."" Not only is this interesting to NVIDIA shareholders, it could help establish the value of AMD's graphics-related patent portfolio as well.

            ","Over on Twitter, I came across the following ""tweet"": 
If anyone buys AMD it should be Apple not Samsung.
This sparked quite an interesting discussion between a lot of smart people, some of whom thought that an acquisition of AMD(NASDAQ:AMD) by Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL) would be a great idea, others not so much. 
I am firmly in the camp that believes Apple would get very little from acquiring AMD. Here is why. 
Not much AMD has to offer that Apple does not already haveAMD's main assets are its CPU core development teams, its graphics processor teams, and its system-on-chip integration teams, and I do not think that Apple really needs the full teams from AMD as it has organic efforts here. 
If that sounds familiar, that is because it is a very similar argument for why I believe Samsung will not acquire AMD. 
As far as CPUs go, Apple is all set. Its low-power CPU cores offer best-in-class performance -- Apple is ahead of Samsung here, actually, as the latter still uses stock ARM cores, and the company seems to be able to poach talent from any company that it would like. 
As far as graphics processors go, Apple has seemingly been hiring graphics talent for quite some time. If Apple really wanted to bring best-in-class graphics IP in-house quickly (rather than try to build it organically as it seems to be doing now), then the company could just buy Imagination Technologies for a fraction of what it would pay for AMD once its debt is factored into the equation. 
Finally, just as Samsung has its own system-on-chip integration teams, so does Apple, and they seem to do a solid job. I do not think having the integration teams in-house would be something Apple would be interested in. 
Does Apple want to sell PC chips and graphics processors?If Apple were to buy AMD, it would necessarily inherit all current business units and projects. AMD builds standalone graphics processors for notebooks and desktops, PC chips that it sells to PC vendors, and it is even working on a number of projects in embedded, servers, and semi-custom. 
I do not believe Apple wants to be in the business of selling chips into all of these markets. While some might argue that Apple could use AMD processors to power its Macs, keep in mind that its PC chips are currently not competitive. Apple would likely need to invest significantly in the acquired AMD asset to bulk up the performance of future AMD products just to make them usable in the Macs. 
And, even then, there is still no guarantee that these chips would wind up competitive enough to boot Intel. 
An Apple buyout of AMD seems like a pipe-dream The idea that Apple will buy AMD seems highly implausible, just like the rumored buyout of AMD by Samsung. I disagree with the author of the tweet mentioned above and think that an Apple/AMD hookup makes even less sense than a Samsung/AMD hookup. 
Samsung, at the very least, would be more likely to try to make AMD's PC processor business viable since it has expressed interest in selling its Exynos processors to other phone/tablet vendors.
Apple, on the other hand, designs chips for its own use -- it is not a merchant chip company nor does it have any ambitions to be one. Picking up a company like AMD just to service its internal chip needs, particularly when Apple already has strong in-house capabilities that it can continue to build organically, just does not make sense.

            ","There has been quite a lot of talk these days about Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) potentially acquiring struggling chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Although such a deal might make sense on the surface, the case for it weakens significantly upon deeper analysis.
The potential rationale for this dealAMD is not all that well, and the company has struggled to generate positive free cash flow for two years. This is not surprising given that its market share in both PC processors as well as stand-alone graphics processors both continue to weaken.
A significant part of the problem looks to be, as has been widely noted at this point, that as AMD revenues weaken, the company has had to cut research and development spending in order to stay afloat. As it does this, its product pipeline also weakens, making it more difficult to compete in future product cycles. This leads to a vicious cycle of even more research and development cuts.
On the other hand, Samsung is flush with cash and generates substantial cash flow year-in and year-out. The popular idea, then, is that Samsung could acquire AMD and give it the necessary funding to be more competitive in its end markets. This, according to some, could potentially lead to revenue growth for AMD and a solid return for Samsung on the acquisition.
Does AMD really bring much to the table?  The first problem with such a deal is that AMD does not offer much to Samsung that it cannot build organically (or acquire more cheaply). AMD's core assets, in my view, are its CPU cores and development teams, its graphics cores and development teams, and its system-on-chip integration teams.
Samsung has already said that it is designing its own CPU cores, and if it wants AMD's talent, it can simply poach it (as it and many other companies have already done). The same argument applies to graphics processors. Samsung also very clearly has its own system-on-chip integration teams, so there is not much value-add for Samsung there, either.
What about x86? A point that AMD bulls will make is that AMD has an x86 license, which allows it to compete in the Windows PC market. This is true, but Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a very established player in the PC processor market, and my view is that its PC-related product pipeline is much stronger than AMD's by virtue of the substantial research and development investments that it has made there.
Now, AMD bulls will say that with Samsung's support, the company could bulk up its x86 processor portfolio and make it a viable competitor in PCs and even servers. That sounds nice in theory, but I think that in order to give the AMD product portfolio a fighting chance, it would need to substantially increase its investments.
Even if Samsung were to bring its investments in x86 chips up to the level of what Intel spends, it would take time for those improvements to actually show up in products.
Then, even if Samsung could significantly improve AMD's x86 design pipeline, it seems unlikely that it would be able to compensate for the manufacturing disadvantage that Samsung has relative to Intel.
Being a fab is a better idea Although Samsung does design its own processors for its own use, it has made it clear that it wants to attract a broad range of foundry customers. Why should it buy AMD and spend lots of money and effort trying to compete with Intel in PCs, when it could profit from building chips for a lot of semiconductor companies?
Between building out its foundry business and building its own Exynos chips for mobile devices, it is hard to see a situation where Samsung wins big with an AMD acquisition. And frankly, if Samsung were interested in AMD, I think it would have acquired it already.

The technology industry has done quite well lately, carrying the Nasdaq Composite back up to the 5,000 mark for the first time since the turn of the millennium. Yet even though many tech stocks have performed well lately, some are facing major challenges that might make some investors reluctant to commit their hard-earned capital.
In order to pinpoint a couple of troubling tech stocks and a solid alternative to recommend, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to give their thoughts on some well-known companies in the technology sector. Look at what they have to say and see what you think about both their bullish and bearish views on these companies.
Tim Green (Advanced Micro Devices): It may seem tempting to buy shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in the hopes of a turnaround, but it's one stock that I'd stay away from. The company's core PC business, which includes PC processors and graphics cards, has been unraveling for the past few years, and its attempts to diversify away from the PC has spread the company's limited resources too thin.
Source: AMD.
Despite high-profile new product launches in recent years, AMD has been bleeding market share to both Intel in the CPU market and NVIDIA in the GPU market. A few years ago, AMD shipped about 40% of all discrete graphics cards; today, this percentage has fallen to just 24% as NVIDIA has consolidated its lead. AMD plans to launch new graphics cards later this year, but the most recent refresh of its product line didn't help in terms of market share at all.
AMD has managed to stay afloat thanks to its deals to provide the processors for the major game consoles, and the company is actively trying to strike additional semi-custom design deals. But any profits from this segment have been largely wiped out by losses in the PC segment and significant interest payments on the company's debt. With any future semi-custom deals unlikely to be anywhere near as big as the game console deals, meaningfully growing the segment will be difficult.
AMD is a company that's trying to compete in too many markets: PC CPUs, GPUs, server CPUs, semi-custom CPUs, and embedded CPUs. Intel spends more than ten times as much on research and development compared to AMD, and even NVIDIA now outspends the company on that front. AMD needs to narrow its focus, and until that happens I can't recommend the stock.
Dan Caplinger (Nokia): One stock I would avoid currently is Nokia (NYSE:NOK), which is only a shell of itself after having sold off its mobile device and services division to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year. It's true that the sale helped Nokia rid itself of what had become an unsuccessful business, as the mobile phone pioneer had failed to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation in the sector and was under threat from more aggressive smartphone makers around the world. What's left is a trio of businesses, with its networking products producing the bulk of Nokia's remaining revenue.
The big issue facing Nokia is whether it can successfully make the transition in an increasingly competitive networking environment. Opportunities abound for growth, especially in the lucrative U.S. market. But the possibility of a dividend cut looms large over Nokia, and even with the stock at relatively reasonable valuations, any reduction in its dividend payout could send the share price tumbling. Nokia will need to demonstrate its ability to tap into important trends like the 5G upgrade cycle while keeping its margins as high as possible. In the long run, Nokia could very well end up on top, but right now, I'd prefer to see how the competition lines up before making bets on the sector.
Bob Ciura (Microsoft): Microsoft is a tech stock investors should buy, because it provides a great combination of growth, value, and dividends, meaning the stock has something to offer virtually all investor types.
Microsoft's two core operating segments, commercial and consumer, both grew revenue last quarter. Devices and consumer revenue grew 8% to $12.9 billion due to several factors. Microsoft sold 10.5 million Lumia units last quarter, leading to $2.3 billion in phone hardware revenue. Surface revenue grew 24%, driven by the success of the Surface Pro 3. Office 365 Home and Personal subscribers jumped 30% to over 9.2 million. Even Bing contributed positively as search advertising revenue rose 23%.
Microsoft's other big business is doing well too. Commercial revenue increased 5% to $13.3 billion thanks squarely to Microsoft's booming enterprise cloud business. Commercial cloud revenue soared 114%, thanks to Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online, and eclipsed a $5.5 billion annualized revenue run-rate. And revenue from server products and services grew 9%.
In all, Microsoft generated $9.9 billion of free cash flow in the first half of its current fiscal year. It paid $4.8 billion of dividends in the same period, which equates to a very comfortable 48% payout ratio. All this cash is piling up on the balance sheet. At the end of last quarter, the company held $90 billion in cash and marketable securities on the books with just a 20% long-term debt to equity ratio.
Microsoft produces huge free cash flow, returns a sizable chunk of it to investors through its 3% dividend, and trades for just 16 times earnings. For all these qualities, Microsoft is a buy.

In previous articles, I highlighted strengths and weaknesses for the company. Today, I want to take a look at five recent statements from the management team and what they could mean for shareholders.
1. It expects the PC business to grow againDuring the fourth quarter earnings call, CEO Lisa Su stated that the PC market will stabilize with low single-digit percentage declines in 2015. Su claimed AMD had ""right-sized"" its investments in the space and had reduced its downstream channel inventory in the fourth quarter.
Su stated, ""We will continue these corrective actions into the first quarter to aim for a return to growth starting in the second quarter."" According to Su, that growth can be accomplished by a reduction in inventory and the upcoming launch of its Carrizo SoCs,
However, investors should recall that revenue at the Computing and Graphics segment slipped 16% year-over-year in 2014, primarily due to lower desktop processor and chipset sales. Meanwhile, Carrizo SoCs are still 28 nanometer chips, which could have trouble competing against fanless Intel 14 nanometer Broadwell chips in ultra-thin notebooks and 2-in-1 devices.
2. Consoles matter more than PCsSu also stated that AMD will increase its R&D investments in the EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) business, which generated 43% of revenue last year.
Annual EESC revenue and operating income rose 51% and 35%, respectively, thanks to robust sales of the Sony PS4 and Microsoft Xbox One, which both run on AMD SoCs. According to Su:
Nearly 30 million Sony and Microsoft consoles have now shipped. Our semi-custom shipments more than doubled in 2014, which fueled excellent full-year performance for this part of our business.
3. Supporting ARM-based serversSince AMD has been marginalized by Intel in servers, it is boosting support for ARM-licensed designs in the EESC business. In regards to supporting ARM's interest in servers, Su stated:
Our work to lead the industry's transition to 64-bit ARM also gained momentum in the quarter. We have secured multiple design wins for our upcoming Opteron A series, and the first systems are expected to launch later this year.
For AMD, the 64-bit Opteron A1100, unveiled last January, is its first ARM-based CPU. The chip is specifically designed for microservers -- a new class of small, low-powered servers which are designated single tasks. 
When companies purchase microservers in clusters, they only purchase the computing power they need. By comparison, a company that purchases a powerful Xeon-powered server might overpay for unused computing power. IDC expects microservers to account for over 10% of the server market by 2016, which could bode well for Opteron-powered microservers.
4. Opportunities for growth in GPUsAMD has been aggressively trying to undercut NVIDIA in high-end graphics cards for years. However, investors should remember that most of the GPU market is comprised of integrated graphics chips like AMD APUs, Intel HD Graphics, and NVIDIA Project Denver.
Within this market, Intel is the clear market leader, with 71.4% of the market, while NVIDIA and AMD control 15% and 13.6%, respectively, according to research firm JPR. But for Su, AMD made progress in this market during the fourth quarter of 2014:
Mobile APU unit shipments, ASPs, and revenue all increased sequentially as our higher-end A8 and A10 APU shipments increased. We also achieved strong double-digit percentage revenue growth for notebook GPUs in the quarter as strategic wins like Apple's iMac with retina 5K display began to ramp.
This split between high-end and low-end GPUs was apparent in the fourth quarter earnings report, which stated that the prices of its GPUs rose sequentially because of higher desktop and notebook GPU average selling prices (ASP) but still declined year-over-year because of a lower channel ASP.
5. A $2 billion market opportunityInvestors should also remember that embedded devices powered by x86 and ARM processors -- which still account for a small part of EESC revenues -- could become more important to the top line. AMD embedded chips are currently used in a wide range of non-PC applications, such as industrial control, automation, and digital gaming.
Speaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in early March, SVP and CFO Devinder Kumar said, ""The available market in that area is about $9 billion. Our target market is $2 billion."" Although Kumar was vague, it means AMD could further distance itself from Intel and NVIDIA and wander into Freescale Semiconductor and Texas Instruments territory instead.
The key takeawaysIn a nutshell, AMD plans to reduce its exposure to consumer PCs, expand its EESC business, and realign its channel sales accordingly. While that sounds like a solid game plan, investors should recall that losses at its troubled Computing and Graphics division wiped out all bottom-line gains at its EESC business last year. If that keeps happening throughout 2015, I would not bet on AMD fixing itself anytime soon.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have fallen 20% over the past 12 months, as shares of top rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) respectively rose 36% and 24%. In previous articles, I discussed AMD's strengths and weaknesses. Today, we'll weigh them against each other to see if AMD is worth buying.

Source: Wikimedia Commons, Rayson Ho.
What AMD's valuations tell usSince AMD isn't profitable, it doesn't have a trailing P/E to compare against Intel and Nvidia. However, AMD is valued at 33 times forward earnings, assuming it can earn $0.09 per share in profit (as forecast by Thomson Reuters) by the end of 2016. By comparison, Intel and Nvidia respectively trade at 13 and 17 times forward earnings.
Over the past few years, former CEO Rory Read reduced AMD's operating expenses, maintained the company's cash at a constant level near $1 billion, and made sure no new debt comes due until 2019. Yet that thrifty strategy, combined with AMD's negative free cash flow of $193 million over the past 12 months, makes it tough for the company to mount any effective marketing blitzes against Intel and NVIDIA.
Potential catalystsAMD's greatest asset is its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment, which accounted for 43% of its top line last year. The business's revenue and operating income respectively rose 51% and 35% year over year in 2014, thanks to robust demand for Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4, which are both powered by AMD system on chips, or SoCs.
To date, 11.5 million Xbox Ones and 19.4 million PS4s have been sold, according to market tracking site VGChartz. Considering that Microsoft and Sony both previously sold about 85 million Xbox 360s and PS3s, AMD's console SoCs could keep contributing to its top line for years to come. Nintendo's next console will reportedly use an AMD SoC as well.

The segment also houses AMD's Opteron processors, which are used to power ""microservers."" Microservers are smaller, cheaper, and less powerful servers that usually only perform a single function, such as loading the background images on a webpage. Smaller companies prefer buying microservers in clusters, because it allows them to only buy the processing power they need. By comparison, big traditional servers -- powered mainly by Intel's Xeon processors -- are expensive ""jacks of all trades"" that are often too powerful for small-to-medium-sized businesses.
Microservers could account for over 10% of the entire server market by 2016, up from just 0.2% in 2011, according to IDC. AMD must compete with Intel's Atom and ARM-based CPUs in this market, but it's still a promising new way for the company to generate fresh revenue.
Potential pitfallsHowever, AMD's computing and graphics segment, which accounted for 57% of its top line last year, is faring much worse. The segment's revenue fell 16% year over year in 2014 as its operating loss widened from $91 million to $478 million. That loss completely erased the $399 million in operating income generated by the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business. The problem is that the segment is being crushed by Intel in x86 CPUs and by NVIDIA in high-end graphics cards, also known as AIBs (add-in boards).

Intel dominates the PC and server markets while selling pricier chips, which puts AMD in the unenviable position of selling fewer chips at cheaper prices. Meanwhile, Intel has its own foundry, which it uses to manufacture new 14-nanometer chips including the fanless Broadwell CPUs.
AMD's chips are manufactured by GlobalFoundries, which was spun off from AMD's manufacturing facilities. GlobalFoundries said it will only start manufacturing 14nm chips in the ""first half of 2015"". As a result, AMD's road map remains focused on its 28nm Carrizo chips, and it probably won't launch 14nm chips until 2016.
As for graphics cards, AMD has steadily fallen behind market leader NVIDIA. According to research firm JPR, AMD's global AIB market share fell from 35% to 24% between the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2014, while Nvidia's share rose from 65% to 76%.
AMD has been trying to undercut NVIDIA on pricing instead. Yet lowering the average selling price hasn't helped AMD gain much ground against its rival. In the fourth quarter of 2014, JPR reported that AMD's overall PC graphics shipments declined 7% year over year as NVIDIA's rose 2.9%. AMD finished the quarter with 13.6% share of the entire GPU market, compared to NVIDIA's 15%. Intel, with its integrated graphics chips, accounted for the remainder of the market.
The verdictIn the end, AMD's weaknesses offset its strengths. Its lack of profitability and inability to turn around its computing and graphics segment overshadow the notable strengths of its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business. A few wild cards -- such as the recent management shake-up and buyout possibilities -- might attract some contrarian investors, but AMD still has much to prove before it can be considered a stable investment.

            ","Over the past five years, shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD)have cratered over 60%. The company, once considered a major threat to the Intel x86 business, lost its way in CPUs, tried to diversify into graphics cards, and then suffered through subsequent pricing wars on both fronts.

In a previous article, I highlighted three key weaknesses at the company -- competitive pressure from Intel and Nvidia, technological inferiority to new Intel chips, and executive turmoil. Today, we will examine the flip side and discuss three strengths investors may have overlooked.
1. Fresh leadership, fresh tacticsLast year, Dr. Lisa Su replaced Rory Read as CEO. Chip chief John Byrne, chief marketing officer Colette LaForce, and chief strategy officer Raj Naik abruptly departed earlier this year. While investors should certainly be concerned with such major changes at the executive level, they should also realize that Read, Byrne, LaForce, and Naik were not exactly steering AMD toward success.
Under Read, operating expenses declined, cash levels were stable around $1 billion, and he ensured that no new debt would come due until 2019. But AMD also scaled back its direct attacks against Intel in PCs and Nvidia in graphics cards, which resulted in lost market share in both categories.
Meanwhile, Su has a background in engineering that Read lacks, which might help AMD diversify into new product categories. 
Shortly before his departure, Byrne dismissed the notion that AMD should expand into the Internet of Things (IoT) to compete against Intel and ARM Holdings, bluntly telling VentureBeat that he was not ""in the business to lose money."" But as I mentioned before, it would be reckless to ignore the IoT market, which IDC forecasts will grow to $7.1 trillion by 2020. Su, who also took over for Byrne, has experience in IoT tech and could help the company expand into that space.
2. Growth in embedded and semi-custom solutionsAMD's core strength is its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business, which manufactures system on a chip (SoC) products. This segment produces components for the Sony PS4 and Microsoft Xbox One, currently the two best-selling consoles in the world. Their robust sales helped the segment boost revenue 51% year-over-year in 2014, accounting for 43% of the top line.
In addition to consoles, AMD has a growing footprint in low-power ""microservers"" that are dedicated to specific tasks, such as loading the background images of a website, and are usually purchased in clusters. By comparison, traditional servers -- mostly powered by Intel Xeon processors -- are powerful but expensive jacks of all trades. IDC expects microservers to account for over 10% of the entire server market by 2016, up from just 0.2% in 2011. 
If AMD Opteron processors can hold the line against Intel Atom and ARM-based SoCs in the microserver market, its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business will continue growing and eventually outweigh the importance of the x86 chip and GPU businesses. Moreover, if AMD changes its tune on IoT devices, the segment could grow even faster.
3. A tempting takeover targetLastly, AMD has been the subject of plenty of takeover rumors. Investors should never buy a beaten down stock hoping for a buyout, but they should understand what makes AMD a lucrative target.
Its most important asset is its long-term license to use the Intel x86 instruction set. This means that a larger, better-funded company could theoretically buy AMD and aggressively attack the near monopolies Intel enjoys in the notebook, desktop, and server markets. That is why AMD is frequently cited as a potential takeover target for companies like Oracle, Broadcom, and Qualcomm. The most recent rumor is that Chinese chipmaker BLX IC Design, which worked with AMD in the past, is interested in acquiring the company.
However, Intel previously tried to prevent AMD from spinning off its manufacturing facilities as GlobalFoundries, claiming that the company could not extend that license to a third party. Therefore, Intel will likely try to block an acquisition of the company. Intel could also try to nullify the x86 license if a takeover occurs, making AMD a much less attractive target. 
Despite those challenges, a market cap of $2.5 billion makes AMD a fairly affordable purchase for an ARM-licensee looking to expand into x86 processors.
The verdictIn my opinion, AMD is still a risky stock to own. However, a change in leadership, growth in embedded and semi-custom SoCs, and the appeal of its x86 license could all help the stock eventually bounce back. But for now, investors should proceed with caution until AMD shows signs of improvement in its long-suffering CPU and GPU businesses.

            ","For the past four years, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has maintained a roughly 60% unit market share in the discrete graphics card market, with the rest going to rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). New product launches and seasonality over that time drove some small fluctuations, but NVIDIA has been able to hang onto its lead.
The third quarter of 2014 marked a distinct change in this dynamic. NVIDIA saw a large increase in its market share, up to around 70%, and it appeared as though NVIDIA was starting to pull away from AMD. This could have just been a fluke, of course, but in the fourth quarter of 2014, NVIDIA's market share rose again, this time to 76%. That's about 11 percentage points higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.

Chart created by author; data from Jon Peddie Research
The graphics card market is starting to look an awful lot like the PC CPU market, where Intel dominates and AMD struggles to turn a profit. AMD needs a huge win with its upcoming launch of new graphics cards, expected sometime in the first half of this year. If it fails to claw back the market share that it's lost, the company risks becoming a bit player in the GPU market, leaving NVIDIA as the undisputed leader.
How did this happen? NVIDIA has benefited from launching an extremely popular pair of graphics cards last September, the GTX 970 and GTX 980. This forced AMD to slash prices across the board, as NVIDIA undercut existing AMD GPUs on price dramatically. The GTX 970 in particular, priced around $350, has proven extremely successful.
According to the Steam Hardware and Software Survey, the GTX 970 is used by more Steam users than any AMD family of GPUs, gaining this lead in the five months since its release. There has been some controversy surrounding the card; whether it ultimately affects sales or benefits AMD is an open question.
An AMD GPU doesn't show up on the survey until the 14th spot, behind eight NVIDIA GPUs and five Intel CPUs with integrated graphics. The AMD R9 200 series, which is AMD's latest high-end family of GPUs, is the 48th most popular graphics card. While this survey isn't a perfect representation of market share, it's likely a very good one, given that Steam users are by definition PC gamers.
The launch of the GTX 970 and 980 certainly contributed to the massive market share gains NVIDIA has enjoyed in the past two quarters. But this kind of thing didn't happen following other major product launches in the past. Instead, NVIDIA's market share stayed roughly the same at around 60%.
Part of this can be explained by the temporary demand created by cryptocurrency miners at the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014. AMD's GPUs are more efficient for mining cryptocurrency, and this helped drive GPU sales for AMD at the time. This demand is now gone, though, and that means a big market has dried up for AMD. This sudden loss of market share may have been more spread out over time had it not been for this temporary surge in demand.
Another component is that AMD has likely fallen behind technologically. The company has been slashing its research and development spending for years, and NVIDIA now outspends AMD despite the latter's far broader portfolio of products. NVIDIA's Maxwell graphics architecture is extremely efficient, and AMD still doesn't have an answer.
AMD needs a big win AMD has a lot riding on its upcoming GPUs. There have been plenty of rumors regarding the cards, but they still haven't been officially announced by the company. The high-end versions will reportedly use a new kind of high-bandwidth memory, giving them an advantage at high resolutions. Whether this leads to higher sales, given the tiny fraction of gamers currently using 4K displays, remains to be seen.
Originally, it was expected that AMD's new cards would be built on a 20nm process, but it's now rumored that both NVIDIA and AMD are skipping 20nm completely. This means any efficiency gains will need to come from AMD's new graphics architecture. This could prove to be a problem, as a new rumor suggests that only the highest-end variants from AMD will be built on a new architecture, with the rest using the current one. What this means if true is unclear, but it does seem strange, and it will make it much more difficult to compete with NVIDIA's midrange Maxwell offerings.
AMD doesn't just need to produce good products, it needs to blow away NVIDIA, both on performance and price. This is starting to seem unlikely, although these rumors could certainly prove incorrect.
If AMD doesn't end up winning back a considerable chunk of market share from NVIDIA when it launches these new cards, it may be time to conclude that NVIDIA's lead has become insurmountable, much like Intel's lead in the PC CPU market.
NVIDIA doesn't have the same advantages that Intel has; both NVIDIA and AMD rely on third-party foundries for manufacturing, unlike Intel. But slashing R&D spending typically doesn't lead to market dominance, and that's exactly what AMD has been doing. The company's PC segment is losing money as it continues to bleed market share to both Intel in CPUs and NVIDIA in GPUs, and the game consoles are the only thing keeping the company afloat.
If AMD doesn't have a smash hit with these new cards, and if NVIDIA doesn't make a huge mistake, NVIDIA could end up becoming the Intel of the graphics card market.

            ","Shares of chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have fallen 15% over the past 12 months as rival Intel has (NASDAQ:INTC) rallied almost 40%. In fiscal 2014, AMD reported a net loss of $403 million, sharply down from a loss of $83 million in 2013, as it struggled to remain relevant in the CPU and GPU markets. 
And things could get much worse for AMD before they get any better. Let's look at three key reasons AMD stock could keep falling this year.
1. Crushed between two giantsFirst and foremost, AMD's margins are getting crushed between Intel's x86 chips and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) high-end graphics cards.
Intel respectively controlled 98.5%, 90.3%, and 81.8% of the server, notebook, and desktop CPU markets in the third quarter of 2014, according to IDC. AMD, left to feed off the scraps of those markets, had to keep selling cheaper chips than Intel to remain competitive. AMD acquired graphics card maker ATI in 2006 to diversify its core business away from CPUs, but that tactic simply sent it into a multiyear price war against NVIDIA. 
This two-pronged war means that AMD has little freedom to raise prices on CPUs or GPUs to offset margin declines. A comparison of AMD's operating margins against Intel and NVIDIA over the past five years shows us where AMD is headed.

On the bright side, AMD's Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business has been booming, fueled by strong sales of its system-on-a-chip, or SOC, products for Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One. Last quarter, the segment's revenue surged 51% year over year in 2014, accounting for 43% of AMD's top line.
2. Falling behind the tech curveAMD recently unveiled its Carrizo SoCs for mobile devices. These SOCs are aimed at gaining ground against ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH)-licensed CPUs, which are installed in the majority of tablets and smartphones worldwide, and Intel's Broadwell chips, which are installed in many newer tablets and 2-in-1 devices.
Carrizo is built on older 28nm tech, compared wwith Intel's 14nm Core M. Intel can develop 14nm chips more efficiently because it has its own foundry.  AMD spun off its foundry joint venture as GlobalFoundries in 2009, and then abandoned that stake in 2012. GlobalFoundries, which still manufactures AMD's chips, plans to start mass production of 14nm chips in the ""first half"" of 2015, but it remains a step behind Intel.
A key difference between 14nm and 28nm chips is that the former is a fanless design, while the latter isn't. This makes Broadwell chips, like the Core M, more attractive to companies that want to produce ultra-thin tablets and 2-in-1 devices. 

Lenovo's Yoga Pro 3 runs on a Core M processor.
AMD is also noticeably absent from the Internet of Things market, or IOT, which is a major blind spot considering that IDC projects global spending on IOT tech to rise from $4.8 trillion in 2012 to $8.9 trillion in 2020. Intel, by comparison, already set up a dedicated IOT business segment last July.
Therefore, Intel's technological superiority, along with its aggressive subsidization plans for its mobile partners, could further reduce AMD's market share.
3. Turmoil at the topLastly, AMD replaced several of its top executives over the past year. Last October, Lisa Su replaced Rory Read as CEO and then promptly announced plans to lay off 7% of AMD's staff. Last month, chip chief John Byrne, Chief Marketing Officer Colette LaForce, and Chief Strategy Officer Raj Naik all stepped down.
In an official statement, AMD claimed that the shakeup would ""sharpen"" the company's execution and position it for growth. But it also indicates that AMD might be suffering from internal conflicts of interest, which could cause it to lose focus as Intel and NVIDIA further marginalize its core businesses.
The takeawaySome contrarian investors might believe that AMD could bounce back on rising console sales or get bought out. Unfortunately, neither reason offsets its lack of pricing power in CPUs and GPUs, its technological inferiority to Intel, and its management issues. Until AMD can address all three of those issues in a meaningful manner, this is one beaten-down stock that I'd avoid.

            ","In the world of PC gaming, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Direct3D, part of DirectX, has long been the dominant graphics API. Almost all high-profile PC games use DirectX, which is tied exclusively to Windows, making the OS the standard for PC gaming.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) attempted to change this last year with the introduction of its own proprietary graphics API, Mantle. Mantle vastly reduced the amount of CPU overhead compared to DirectX, leading to big gains in performance in situations where the CPU was the bottleneck.
I argued last year that Mantle had absolutely no chance of success, and that it would provide no benefit whatsoever to AMD, because the next version of Direct X would introduce the same efficiency gains. With the release of Windows 10 and DirectX 12 coming later this year, the first benchmarks comparing DirectX 12 to Mantle have been released. It's not pretty for AMD.
DirectX 12 is the real deal The folks over at Anandtech recently tested an early version of DirectX 12, and the results show two things.

Source: Anandtech
First, the gains in performance compared to DirectX 11 are substantial, and in cases where the CPU is the bottleneck, big gains are very possible. Second, DirectX 12 produces similar results on AMD cards compared to Mantle. Mantle is still a bit faster in most cases, but given DirectX 12 is still months away from release, this difference may be temporary.
Both DirectX 12 and Mantle achieve these performance gains by eliminating much of the overhead involved with sending commands to the GPU. DirectX 11 hits a severe bottleneck if the number of commands grows too large, and it looks like DirectX 12 will fix this problem.
Why DirectX 12 is important for Microsoft One reason, although certainly not the only reason, that Windows has remained the dominant PC operating system is gaming. The fact that almost all PC games are built on DirectX, instead of the alternative cross-platform OpenGL, gives Windows an enormous advantage. According to the Steam hardware and software survey, about 95.5% of Steam users are running some form of Windows, with the scraps split between Mac and Linux.
Maintaining Windows' dominance in the PC gaming market is critical for Microsoft, and that requires DirectX to remain the de facto standard graphics API. Mantle was always unlikely to usurp DirectX, given that it only works on a subset of AMD products, and neither Intel nor NVIDIA was ever going to support it. But allowing DirectX to fall too far behind could have opened the door for the next version of OpenGL, which will also introduce gains in efficiency. This now appears unlikely given the early DirectX 12 performance numbers.
Why AMD's Mantle will lead nowhere Mantle was always a long shot, but at the very least it likely spurred Microsoft to focus on efficiency. Mantle has gained the support of a decent number of games and game engines, but it's difficult to fathom where Mantle fits once DirectX 12 is released. There may still be some performance benefits for AMD's GPUs, but with NVIDIA the market leader in discrete GPUs and Intel the overwhelming market leader in integrated GPUs, supporting Mantle likely won't make much sense for developers.
AMD's PC business has been falling apart recently, and it was honestly a waste of resources to develop an alternative graphics API. It's now clear from the DirectX 12 performance figures that Mantle's advantage is going to largely disappear later this year, and it's also clear from NVIDIA's market share gains that Mantle has done exactly nothing to boost AMD's GPU business.
AMD deserves credit for starting the conversation on eliminating graphics API overhead. But that conversation will be finished without it, and AMD will get no credit where it matters: the bottom line.

New investors are often attracted to penny stocks due to the large opportunity for profits they seem to present. ""If the shares can just trade up from $0.10 to $0.20 each, I'd double my money"" is a popular line of thinking.
But penny stocks are inherently dangerous: A cesspool of failed companies, frauds, and schemes intended to transfer money from the greedy newbie to their motivated, if unsavory, operators.
The history of penny stocksBefore electronic trading and discount brokerage firms, penny stocks got a bad rap for being prohibitively expensive. In the old days, you'd pay as much as a quarter-point ($0.25) to buy or sell a share of stock.
This was the brokerage firm's commission. And because it was set in stone -- it didn't matter whether a share traded for $1 or $100 -- the commission made up a much bigger portion of your investment in penny stocks than it did on pricier shares.
Many mutual funds enacted policies to avoid stocks which trade for less than $5 per share for reasons of expense (they pay commissions, too) or because of their speculative nature. And over time, it just so happened that the feeling became something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. People avoided penny stocks, and thus it became generally accepted that only the worst companies would let their shares trade at penny stock prices. 
Penny stocks todayThe widely accepted definition of penny stocks has been somewhat extended to cover other, higher-priced stocks which also trade in less-regulated, over-the-counter markets.
Over-the-counter stocks are generally less liquid, and they have fewer requirements to remain listed. Many don't even bother to file financial reports on time, or at all. And they're often managed by people with a less-than-stellar pedigree.
Conflicts of interest are especially common. I've seen it all -- from company-owned planes that are used more for the executives' pleasure than business, to companies that pay above-market rents because the CEO just so happens to also be the landlord.
That isn't to say that these bad behaviors are inherent in penny stocks, just that they're more common. One of the benefits of obscurity is that some managers can get away with a lot more without the benefit of prying eyes looking over their every financial filing.
Should you buy penny stocks?If I were to paint with broad strokes, I'd recommend avoiding them entirely. There are, however, legitimate companies that happen to have low share prices. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), a company which makes many of the chips in electronics ranging from laptops to phones, has long traded for prices in the penny stock range of less than $5. 
Likewise, Roche Holding (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY), a Swiss health care company many would recognize, has shares listed on the over-the-counter market to allow American investors to invest in it.
AMD and Roche are legitimate businesses, and are not penny stocks. They file regular financial reports, adequately disclose their business lines to investors, and are clearly not illegitimate companies. They just happen to have a single trait of most penny stocks -- a low per-share price or an OTC listing.
 Many penny stock and OTC-listed companies are nothing more than shells. They include the likes of marijuana companies that exert more effort to market their stock than their products, and ""dark"" companies that haven't filed financial statements in years.
A large number (by my count over 40%) of OTC stocks are considered ""grey market"" stocks, which do not require any filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Can you imagine investing in a business, having no idea what it earns, or even what its business model entails? That's the case for nearly half of stocks that trade over the counter.
Though they may seem like an easy and simple way to quick profits, know that penny stocks are anything but. The ""easy"" way to get rich in stocks is to buy good businesses and own them for a very, very long time -- years, if not decades. Investors dominate the list of Forbes 400 billionaires, but I can assure you it wasn't penny stocks that created their wealth.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been struggling against rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market, losing market share and reporting dismal fourth-quarter earnings. AMD is expected to launch a new batch of GPUs during the first half of this year, and while I'm not optimistic that a single product launch can right the ship, the company does have a trick up its sleeve. AMD is rumored to be using high-bandwidth-memory, or HBM, in some of its new GPUs, providing drastically more memory bandwidth compared to NVIDIA's products. AMD needs any advantage that it can get, but how meaningful of an impact will HBM really have?
Why memory bandwidth is important GPUs process a tremendous amount of data per second. While performance is ultimately limited by a GPU's processing power, a potential bottleneck is the rate at which a GPU can read data from its own memory. This rate is called the memory bandwidth.
To get a sense of how much data is involved, imagine a graphics card with 4GB of memory running a game at sixty frames-per-second. Each frame, the GPU needs to deal with all of the data necessary to draw the scene, including data representing all of the objects, like characters and buildings, and textures that are applied to those objects. Given the visual detail and richness of modern PC games, an enormous amount of data is needed to make the image on the screen look realistic.
If this hypothetical graphics cards needs to access all 4GB of its memory once per frame, the memory bandwidth needs to be 240 GB/s. This is a simplification: Some data may need to be accessed more than once per frame, and some less frequently, but this estimate is a good ballpark figure. NVIDIA's high-end GTX 980, for example, has a memory bandwidth of 224 GB/s, allowing it to access nearly all of its 4GB of memory every frame.
As the screen resolution increases, the GPU needs to deal with an increasing amount of data. A 4K monitor has quadruple the number of pixels compared to a 1080p monitor, and that means all of the per-pixel data that the GPU churns through quadruples as well.
Star Citizen, an upcoming crowdfunded PC game, will have support for not only 4K resolutions, but 8K resolutions as well. This requires the development team to include 4K and 8K textures for any object that gets close to the player; a lower-resolution texture would appear blurry. The GPU memory bandwidth required to deal with all of this data will need to be truly enormous, to say the least.
Existing graphics cards can play games at 4K resolutions, but not particularly well at high settings. NVIDIA's GTX 980 has trouble hitting playable framerates in many games, and part of the reason is likely its low memory bandwidth.
AMD could own 4K gaming, at least for a while AMD is reportedly going to use HBM in its high-end graphics cards this year, providing a memory bandwidth as high at 640GB/s, according to unconfirmed specifications. That's nearly triple what the GTX 980 offers, and this should help AMD's new GPUs excel at 4K gaming.
NVIDIA will eventually adopt HBM, but it's unlikely to happen until GPUs based on its next-gen architecture, Pascal, are released sometime in 2016. This gap will give AMD's products a distinct advantage in the 4K gaming market for a while.
However, the ultimate importance of this advantage is questionable. The percentage of PC gamers using 4K monitors is currently minuscule, and with all of this extra bandwidth largely unnecessary at lower resolutions, being first may not lead to many extra sales for AMD. Steam's hardware and software survey puts the percentage of its users with a monitor above a resolution of 1080p at just 3.25%. Only 0.03% of users have monitors with 4K resolutions.
Another potential issue is the price. HBM is a new memory technology, which means that it's going to be expensive. We won't know how expensive until AMD's new GPUs are officially announced, but the highest-end GPU may end up being priced well above NVIDIA's GTX 980.
Now, it's possible that AMD's new GPUs will spur adoption of 4K monitors, given that most existing GPUs can't handle 4K very well today. Buy 4K monitors are still quite expensive, and 1080p monitors are far cheaper in comparison. I suspect that 4K monitors will need to become much more affordable for 4K gaming to go mainstream, and that puts a limit on the benefits potentially realized by AMD for being first to market with an HBM graphics card.
If the rumors prove true, AMD's use of HBM will certainly give it an advantage. But given the meager adoption rate of 4K monitors, it probably won't matter very much in the grand scheme of things.

            ","To put it bluntly, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had a terrible fourth quarter. Revenue fell 22% year over year, according to the processor maker's latest earnings release, while earnings, adjusted for some big write-offs, landed at breakeven. While the gaming consoles business kept AMD afloat, the PC business appears to be falling apart. Computing and graphics revenue fell 16% year over year, with the segment losing $56 million during the quarter. Additionally, an inventory write-off related to the company's APUs doesn't exactly vindicate the company's strategy.
Big problemsWhile the PC market has stabilized, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reporting rising PC chip volumes in both the fourth quarter and 2014 as a whole, AMD is still suffering from huge sales declines. With AMD grouping CPUs and GPUs in the computing and graphics segment, it's difficult to tell exactly how each business is doing. But it's clear Intel continues to win market share from AMD, despite already dominating the market.
Of course, Intel has some enormous advantages. While AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its chips, Intel produces its own chips, and it is shipping its new Broadwell processors built on a 14-nanometer process. AMD is still stuck at 28 nanometers, and its upcoming Carrizo APUs, set to launch in the first half of this year, will remain a generation behind Intel. This will make it difficult, if not impossible, for AMD to keep up on power efficiency.
During the fourth quarter, AMD wrote off $58 million of inventory related to its desktop APU products. This should not be ignored: AMD's entire PC strategy has revolved around the powerful integrated graphics in its APUs, but it appears demand simply isn't there. In contrast, Intel reported that its desktop CPU volume fell just 1% during the fourth quarter.
The average selling price of AMD's GPUs also declined year over year, although the company did not disclose any information about volume. Part of this weakness is likely due to the demand from cryptocurrency miners, which buoyed AMD's GPU business in late 2013 and early 2014, vanishing, as pointed out by CEO Lisa Su during the company's conference call. During the third quarter, rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) claimed about 70% of the GPU market by unit volume, and its recent GPU products forced AMD to slash prices late last year.
This is what a train wreck looks like It seems the investment thesis for AMD over the past few years has been that, while things aren't great now, the next batch of products will return the company to prosperity. AMD is launching new APUs later this year, as well as new GPUs, and both come with a bit of hype.
It's the same story, though, every time AMD launches a new product. Expectations are high, but ultimately the company fails to deliver. Both Intel and NVIDIA keep winning market share, and those promising APUs had to be written off in the fourth quarter. AMD is starting to sound like a broken record.
AMD expects revenue during the first quarter to decline by 15% sequentially, anticipating just $1.05 billion in total. The company did not mention how big of a year-over-year decline this would represent, probably because that number is much scarier. AMD is guiding for an astonishing 25% year-over-year revenue decline next quarter. It also expects lower revenue than it collected in the first quarter of 2013, which occurred well before the game consoles even launched. 
At this point, any profits from the game console business are being eaten by PC losses and interest payments. Research and development spending is collapsing, down 19% year over year during the fourth quarter. While cost reductions will help profitability, it's hard to imagine how AMD is supposed to keep up with Intel and NVIDIA by constantly slashing R&D.
Banking on a miracle second half, driven by new product launches, is extremely optimistic. Past new product releases have done little to fix AMD's PC business, and it doesn't look any different this time around. AMD doesn't have the resources to fight multiple wars on multiple fronts with both Intel and NVIDIA, and this is showing in its results. AMD's PC business is unraveling, and there appears to be little hope it can be saved.

            ","The S&P 500 was up over 11% last year, exceeding many analyst expectations. Despite the bullish market, some companies still underperformed. Sometimes it is the entire industry taking a hit, and other times, the poor performance is specific to an individual company. 
Today, three Motley Fool contributors weigh in on the turnaround stories they're watching for 2015: Coach (NYSE:TPR),  Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and InvenSense (NYSE:INVN).
Andres Cardenal (Coach): Coach made a series of expensive mistakes over the last several years -- the company expanded too quickly, designs did not resonate well among consumers, and excessive promotions eroded the brand image. However, management is actively trying to turn things around, and Coach is an interesting candidate to watch in 2015 and beyond.
The company is reducing its store count and cutting back on promotions in order to recover its aspirational halo. It also hired Stuart Vevers as the new creative director in September 2013, and he is working to transform Coach into a full lifestyle brand.
The December quarter will be the first full quarter including sales from his new collection. Considering the importance of the holiday shopping season, the next earnings report should give investors an opportunity to evaluate Coach's ability to get back on track.
Also, while total sales in North America declined 19% year-over-year to $634 million during the third quarter, international revenues were up 4% to $381 million. Sales in China, a particularly promising market for the company, jumped 10% during the period, so international markets seem to offer considerable room for growth in the mid-term.
For what it's worth, management believes the new collection is performing according to expectations, and CEO Victor Luis said in the last conference call that press coverage for this new collection was ""overwhelmingly positive, building on the response to Fall 2014 and driving fashion, credibility, and buzz.""
Anders Bylund (Advanced Micro Devices): AMD had a terrible year in 2014. Share prices plunged 32% lower, mostly in a difficult span from September through October. The microchip designer missed Wall Street earnings targets in each of it two latest quarters, and analysts expect more pain ahead.
AMD CEO Lisa Su. Source: AMD
But the plucky semiconductor underdog is under new management, and I think that recently appointed CEO Lisa Su has what it takes to turn the beat around. The market, on the other hand, begs to differ.
The biggest drop in October had nothing to do with soft earnings but sprung from the news that Su would be replacing Rory Read in the corner office. The market reaction was like a huge vote of no confidence in the new CEO.
I'm here to tell you that Su knows the business inside and out, having run AMD's global (read: international) business unit since 2012. She comes with a rock-solid technical pedigree with an MIT doctorate in electrical engineering. She's spent more than 20 years running technical and leadership operations at the chip divisions at Freescale, IBM, and Texas Instruments. She's a much needed tech-oriented upgrade from Read's deeper business-side focus.
Rory Read started pointing AMD in a new direction. Su continues to move the company out of the commodity PC processor market and deeper into custom products for markets like gaming consoles and the Internet of Things.
Lisa Su is the right person with the right strategy, at exactly the right time. If the market understands these things in 2015, AMD's stock should run higher once again.
Ashraf Eassa (InvenSense): Over the last year, shares of MEMS vendor InvenSense have lost about 35% -- pretty rough for a company that just won a spot in the latest Apple iPhones!
Last quarter, the company saw a large drop in gross profit margins as a result of an (unexpected) inventory write down. I believe this shook investor confidence, particularly as poor inventory management lies squarely on the shoulders of the people running the company.
InvenSense also reported margin pressure as a result of high customer concentration at Apple and Samsung, which stoked the fears of the risks typically associated with this issue -- continued margin pressure and the potentially huge financial impact of losing a major customer. 
As I've indicated previously, I think the InvenSense ""turnaround"" story in 2015 will consist of two parts. First, InvenSense needs to avoid the execution mishaps that it suffered in 2014. The company really can't afford any negative surprises in the near future if it wants to restore investor confidence. Things happen and no company will execute 100% each-and-every quarter, but InvenSense needs to take particular care in the near-term to set expectations properly and execute well on those expectations.
Next, the company needs to prove that it can, without further eroding its gross profit margin profile, keep its premium mobile device wins while at the same time delivering on its stated goal to push more into the midrange phone market. This could be demonstrated by growing the business at a rapid clip over the next year or so, while maintaining at least a 45% gross profit margin.
InvenSense reports its quarterly earnings on Jan. 29th, and I look forward to seeing how the company performed relative to guidance and what it ends up guiding to for the following quarter.

So you're interested in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). I hope you have a strong stomach, or a duffel bag full of antacids.
When the semiconductor designer reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday evening, the report kicked off a rollicking roller-coaster ride. The stock opened Wednesday's trading session at two-year lows, but immediately bounced back in a big way. Just 40 minutes into the market session, the difference between Wednesday's highs and lows was more than 11%. By 3 p.m., AMD's stock was up some 5% from the previous day's close at $2.24.
Against that backdrop, it can be hard to tell whether AMD's fourth quarter was a big disappointment or a positive turning point. So let me walk you through what's going on here.
First, let's get the basic numbers out of the way.
Analysts were expecting AMD to report net earnings of $0.01 per share on sales of $1.24 billion. Revenues fell 22% year over year to land exactly at the analyst target, yielding breakeven earnings. So in terms of pure earnings figures, the quarter was a slight disappointment.
More to the point, AMD staged a bit of a business revival in 2013 and 2014, but this report took the edge off those gains:

But if every trend is negative, how come the stock is rising again? Here's a novel idea: Investors may be looking beyond the current quarter for signs of a sustainable turnaround. And the numbers rarely tell the whole story.

Recently appointed CEO Lisa Su certainly presented AMD's results in a positive light. ""We made progress diversifying our business, ramping design wins and improving our balance sheet this past year despite challenges in our PC business,"" she said in prepared remarks. The business mix is shifting away from mass-market PC processors and graphics chips, and AMD is leaning more on semi-custom products for embedded systems and game consoles.
In fact, inventories of PC-style products such as CPUs and add-in graphics boards were painfully high at the start of the fourth quarter. AMD took steps to correct the oversupply by reducing manufacturing orders, which led to ""short-term pressure in the business"" but sets AMD up for a stronger 2015.
Here's where the good news starts.
Su knows that AMD is winning in the semi-custom market while losing badly to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the traditional PC segment. Her solution is simple: apply the operating discipline and lessons learned in the custom chip sector to the ailing PC market.
""We clearly have more work to do to improve the overall revenue and financial performance of this segment,"" Su said. ""We must think differently in 2015 about our market approach and investment priorities.""
She's remixing this division to sell more high-end products and fewer of the truly mass-market chips on the lower end. That means leaving some easy but unprofitable sales on the table, but improving profit margins.
On a grander scale, AMD managed to grow full-year sales for the first time since 2011 while also delivering positive non-GAAP earnings.
So Su is not afraid to roll up her sleeves and get some serious work done. AMD's business approach is overdue for an update, and she's getting it done.
As an Intel shareholder, I'm not exactly shaking in my boots over the threat AMD poses right now. But Su's detailed tech insights may set AMD on a path that leads to becoming a serious Intel challenger once again. Right now, she's saddled with repairing the mess that predecessor Rory Read left behind. It's not easy work, and I wouldn't suggest loading your retirement nest egg into AMD stock today. But if she can pull it off, she'll spark an impressive turnaround in AMD's ailing stock as well.
So this one's for the gamblers, the speculators, and those with a bit of disposable funds to play around with. I'm tempted to buy a small ticket to the AMD lottery myself, if only to see what Su can do with it. In the meantime, I just gave AMD a thumbs-up rating in our Motley Fool CAPS system.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have plunged 37% over the past 12 months as the struggling chipmaker announced layoffs and missed Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations under new CEO Lisa Su. 
On Monday, AMD announced the departure of three top executives: Senior Vice President John Byrne, Chief Marketing Officer Colette LaForce, and Chief Strategy Officer Raj Naik. Byrne notably only spent seven months as general manager of the company's computing and graphics division.
Just last week, Byrne discussed his view of the Internet of Things, or IoT during a VentureBeat interview at CES 2015. When asked whether AMD would expand into the IoT market as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has done with wearables and tiny Quark chips, Byrne flatly replied, ""I'm not in the business to lose money. Share and revenue is nice but so is profitability."" Byrne emphasized that AMD should focus on improving the performance and power efficiency of its x86 chips instead.

But now that Byrne has moved on, it might be time for AMD to reevaluate its position on IoT, which could prevent it from being crushed between Intel's x86 chips and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs.
The business of the Internet of ThingsThe concept of IoT is that everything -- wearables, cars, home appliances, and more -- will be connected to one another through various wireless standards. Research firm IDC believes the global IoT market will grow from $1.9 trillion in 2013 to $7.1 trillion by 2020. Presumably, that rising tide could lift chipmakers such as Intel, networking companies such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Internet giants including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Intel's Internet of Things division consists of embedded chipsets that are used in retail environments, industrial sites, buildings, homes, and transportation. Over the first nine months of 2014, revenue at Intel's IoT group rose 23% year over year to $1.55 billion as operating income improved 26% to $431 million. While Intel's IoT segment only accounted for about 4% of its revenue and operating income during that period, its double-digit growth and profitability strongly suggest IoT might not be a money-losing venture for AMD after all.
AMD, though, lacks Intel's market clout -- according to IDC's third-quarter numbers, Intel controls 98.5% of the server market, 90.3% of the notebook market, and 81.8% of the desktop market. This means Intel can likely sell more embedded solutions on the foundations of its x86 market share than AMD can.
Birds of preyThat's not to say AMD does not have any embedded products at all. Last year, the company unveiled several such products -- Adelaar, Steppe Eagle, Bald Eagle, and Hierofalcon -- to expand into industrial control and automation, digital gaming, medical imaging, digital surveillance, smart TVs, and other non-PC businesses.
While those ""birds of prey"" are certainly scouting ahead for a possible expansion into IoT, AMD hasn't split those technologies into a separate IoT business in the way Intel has. Instead, they reside in AMD's enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (server and embedded processors, systems-on-chip, engineering services, and royalties) business.
In the first nine months of 2014, revenue from that segment more than doubled to $1.8 billion and accounted for 42% of AMD's top line. That growth was helped by robust system-on-chip sales of for Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 4 consoles.
Like a frog in boiling waterAMD has always been considered the cheaper alternative to Intel and NVIDIA, respectively, in x86 chips and high-end graphics cards. The problem is that whenever AMD's market share declines, margins fall as it tries to generate fresh revenue growth with cheaper products.

Source: YCharts
In the first nine months of 2014, AMD's computing and graphics revenue (which accounted for 58% of its top line) fell 13% year over year as it posted an operating loss of $20 million. AMD is also falling behind the technological curve when it comes to mobile processors -- its new 28-nanometer mobile Carrizo system-on-chip might not appeal to tablet and two-in-one manufacturers, which are already experimenting with Intel's 14 nm Core M chips.
As AMD's market share remains under pressure in x86 chips and GPUs, it is increasingly finding itself being cornered by Intel. I believe AMD's revenue will keep declining unless the company increases the weight of its higher-growth embedded devices and system-on-chip offerings on its top line. Expanding the company's IoT efforts would be a reasonable way to do so, and would be a solid starting point for Byrne's successor.

            ","A well-known storyline in the PC processor market is that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the dominant player in what Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) former CEO once described as an ""unhealthy duopoly,"" has been taking market segment share away from AMD for some time. According to Citigroup's Chris Danely (via Barron's), Intel continues to do so at the expense of its smaller rival.
The story so far At the high end of the PC market, Intel's PC chips have done extremely well against AMD's offerings. However, AMD had for some time successfully deployed relatively quick, purpose-built, low-cost processors for the lower end of the market. These went up against the old Atom processors, but those Atom chips offered awful performance while AMD's comparable offerings were quite good. It's no surprise AMD did well. 
In fact, AMD did so well that Intel executive, Kirk Skaugen, admitted at an investor conference last year that the company's share in the value portion of the PC market had dropped below 50%. At the time, Skaugen also expressed confidence that the company would win back share with the Bay Trail-M and Bay Trail-D processors launched in late 2013, particularly as those processors had more competitive cost structures than what Intel had used previously in that segment.
Given that Intel reported a 14% increase in its low-cost PC processor revenue during 2014, while AMD's PC-related revenues crumbled, it's a safe bet that Intel gained material share -- just as it had aimed to.

More of the same probably coming in 2015 I expect this trend to continue throughout 2015. In the midrange and high end of the PC market, Intel's products are extremely competitive, as has been the case for quite some time. And at the lower end of the market, I expect Intel's products to become even more competitive.
Keep in mind that Intel's Bay Trail-M/D chips, while offering very good power consumption and CPU performance, lacked raw graphics performance relative to the AMD parts. While AMD has not released the full specifications of its just-announced Carrizo-L chip, slated to hit the market in mid-2015, Intel is reportedly launching the 14-nanometer successors to Bay Trail-M/D, known as Braswell, in the third quarter of this year.
I believe these will offer better power efficiency than the AMD models, as Braswell will be a 14-nanometer part while Carrizo-L will remain on 28-nanometers. While it's possible, or even likely, that Carrizo-L will offer better raw graphics performance than the highest-end Braswell chips, I think it will require far more power to get that performance.
For low-cost thin, light, and fanless systems, I imagine Braswell will be a more attractive solution than the Carrizo-L part. As a result, I would not be surprised to see further share loss for AMD in the PC market this year. 
2016 is the open question While the market segment share trends outlined here seem reasonable based on what we know, it's too early to call any trends for 2016. Intel will, of course, compete quite fiercely with Skylake and its 10-nanometer Cannonlake part, but AMD also plans to launch its next-generation X86 architecture known as Zen.
AMD bulls are optimistic that Zen, which is the X86 counterpart to the clean-sheet K12 architecture, will improve AMD's competitiveness considerably on the CPU side of things. This part is also reportedly set to be built on a 14/16-nanometer foundry FinFET processes, which should narrow the very wide process gap that seems to exist between AMD's Carrizo/Carrizo-L (28-nanometer) and Intel's Broadwell/Skylake/Braswell (14-nanometer).

            ","Not content with its dependence on the market for traditional PCs, Advanced Micro Devices'(NASDAQ:AMD) recent turnaround strategy has centered on delivering silicon for what it calls semi-custom solutions: PC-like devices powered by slightly customized AMD processors.
There is no better example of AMD's strategy in action than the latest video game consoles: Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) Wii U, Sony's PlayStation 4, and Microsoft's Xbox One all use AMD chips.
Its exposure to the industry gives the company a unique perspective -- as a major supplier, AMD is well-suited to forecast upcoming devices. Last month, it did exactly that. At a Raymond James technology conference, AMD's CFO, Devinder Kumar, announced that his company had secured design wins for two upcoming devices, at least one of which could be a gaming console.
Kumar's comments""I'm pleased to report we have those design wins,"" Kumar said, noting that the company had previously told investors to expect two new semi-custom designs from the company. ""Those parts will get introduced in 2016 ... at least one will be beyond gaming.""
From AMD's perspective, the devices could prove vital: According to Kumar, they could add $1 billion to AMD's revenue over a period of three years from 2016 onward. That's fairly significant, as AMD generated just $1.6 billion of revenue in 2013.
However, their exact nature remains largely unknown. Kumar's wording (""at least one will be beyond gaming"") leaves a lot of possibilities open. Still, it seems fair to say that at least one -- and possibly both -- of these products will play games in some capacity.
Nintendo admits it's working on a new consoleA handheld video game console from Nintendo is a strong possibility. Nintendo's current handheld, the 3DS, is almost four years old. In the past, the Japanese video game giant has released new handheld consoles on a regular basis, launching a new product every four to six years.
Although the market for dedicated handheld consoles has been eroded by the growth of smartphones and tablets, Nintendo's management remains committed to its long-standing strategy. Last month, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto told the Associated Press that his company was hard at work on its next-generation of devices.
Nintendo's 3DS uses an ARM-based processor, and given ARM's advantage in power consumption, the 3DS' successor will likely do the same. That would've been a problem for AMD in the past, but earlier this year, the company secured an ARM license, allowing it to offer both ARM and x86-based processors.
According to Kumar, one of AMD's semi-custom design wins also uses an ARM-based processor. Could it be the next Nintendo handheld? Other AMD executives have made supportive statements -- last June, AMD's Saeid Moshkelani told Barron's that AMD had great interest in the handheld gaming space, noting that despite widespread skepticism, Nintendo's ""3DS is still selling.""
A new entrant?A new console from Sony or Microsoft would be quite a surprise, given the relatively recent debut of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. If AMD isn't making a game device for Nintendo, it might be building a processor for a non-traditional player.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has shown great interest in the space in recent months, hiring major game developers and buying a video game studio outright, in addition to its purchase of the popular video game streaming service, Twitch. Amazon's set-top box, the Fire TV, allows its owners to play video games, though the graphical fidelity is lackluster. A more powerful game console from the e-commerce giant would not be particularly surprising.
There are other possibilities. Android TV, a modified version of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) mobile operating system designed to power set-top boxes, has attracted the attention of several gaming firms. Razer, a company known primarily for its gaming PC peripherals, unveiled the Android TV-powered Forge TV at CES last week. Forge TV sports a Qualcomm chip, but a similar product powered by AMD silicon could eventually make its way to market.
Betting on semi-customUnfortunately, these gaming wins have done little for AMD shareholders. Since the debut of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in Nov. 2013, AMD shares have lost roughly 25% of their value, badly underperforming the broader market. Despite bringing in revenue, AMD's console contracts have been criticized for their low margins.
The same may ultimately hold true for AMD's two new design wins. Still, it's evidence that AMD's plan -- derive 50% of its revenue from high-growth markets, including semi-custom solutions -- is on track.

            ","In 2013, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) outlined a strategy to win back share in the server market after losing significant ground to larger rival, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD asserted it would be ""the leader in ARM servers"" and that it would have ""substantial share of the X86 CPU market"" at some point in the future.
As we enter 2015, it is worth looking at AMD's progress in the server market since those initial announcements.
The story on ARM so far Advanced Micro Devices announced in July that developer kits powered by the Seattle processor were available for purchase. Then, at Hot Chips 2014, AMD did a deeper technical disclosure of the Seattle chip. Since then, though, AMD has been relatively quiet about its dense server efforts.
As Charlie Demerjian of SemiAccurate pointed out last month, two major ARM server chip vendors are now actually selling parts: Cavium and Applied Micro. His article takes a dig at AMD, stating that ""there would be three if the soap opera that is AMD was anything more than infinite but hollow press releases.""
At any rate, while Seattle is a real, working chip, it's not clear whether it is in production yet, and if it is, whether it has many -- if any -- major customers. This will probably become clearer over time.
What about X86? While there has much fanfare around its ARM efforts, AMD has made clear it plans to continue competing in the X86 server chip market. Planet 3DNow! (via WCCFTech) has posted the following AMD server road map, which is current through November 2013:

Source: Planet 3DNow!
According to this road map, AMD has no plans to update its two-socket and four-socket CPUs in 2015. It does, however, plan to bring two new X86 chips to market: Toronto APU and Toronto CPU. These will apparently integrate two Excavator modules/four Excavator x86 cores, support DDR3/DDR4, have PCIe3 support, and come as single, integrated system-on-chip parts.
The main difference between the two chips is that the APU will feature integrated graphics while the CPU apparently will not.
It seems that the ""small"" AMD x86 cores do not make an appearance here, with AMD opting to address any market requiring many small cores with ARM and any markets requiring more per-core performance with its ""big"" X86 cores.
What does AMD's competitive positioning look like in 2015? I don't think this road map is going to be particularly competitive with what Intel should have this year. The aging Warsaw CPUs (32-nanometer Piledriver) will find it difficult to compete with Intel's Haswell-EP and, potentially, Broadwell-EP chips (although the latter have reportedly been delayed into 2016).
For one-socket systems, AMD will likely have to compete with the Xeon E5 v3 chips (Broadwell) during the first half of the year and with the Xeon E3 v5 chips (Skylake) during the second half of the year. Additionally, CPU World reported that Intel's integrated Xeon D processor, which is a system-on-chip design that should be comparable to the Toronto CPU, will launch in the second quarter of 2015.
This should have up to eight Broadwell CPU cores and will be built on Intel's 14-nanometer FinFET manufacturing technology. In contrast, the Toronto CPU features just four Excavator cores (and per-core Excavator is likely weaker than Broadwell).
We'll have to see what kind of I/O AMD brings to Toronto CPU to properly compare the chips. However, my bet is that the 14-nanometer Xeon D will be more powerful and more efficient than what is likely a 28-nanometer Toronto CPU.
AMD probably need to wait until 2016 for a potential improvement Advanced Micro Devices' competitive positioning in the server chip market looks weak during 2015. However, the story could get better in 2016 when AMD is expected to roll out system-on-chip products based on its new X86 and ARM CPU cores known as Zen and K12, respectively. Bringing new technology to market is no guarantee of success (Intel isn't sitting idly by), but it will be interesting to see if AMD can improve its competitive positioning.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares have been in freefall lately. In the week and a half after it slashed its second-quarter guidance earlier this month, AMD stock fell 24%, while arch-rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) decreased just 0.5%, and the S&P 500 market barometer gained nearly 3%. The plunge included a 4.6% drop on Thursday, following Intel's surprisingly solid earnings report, and on the eve of AMD's own presentation.
AMD's second-quarter results are in, and they provided its share price a brief respite from the never-ending slide. AMD stock gained more than 2.5% in after-hours trading as investors absorbed the report. But on Friday, that brief gain was erased in short order. The stock closed another 4% lower that day.
As presaged in the guidance update, AMD's sales decreased 8% quarter over quarter and 35% year over year. At $942 million, it's AMD's lowest quarterly sales since 2004.
This is what AMD is all about right now. Image source: AMD.
The company saw strong demand for enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom chip products, and revenue rose 13% in that division. It wasn't enough to overcome a 29% sequential sales drop in the computing and graphics segment, driven by very weak orders from PC system builders. In particular, notebook processors were in low demand.
On the bottom line, AMD saw an adjusted net loss of $0.17 per share. That's nearly twice the red ink seen in the first quarter, and down from a $0.05 profit per share in the year-ago period.
Analysts were quick to adjust their revenue targets in line with AMD's new guidance. The company didn't offer updated earnings guidance two weeks ago, but did deliver on its promise of an adjusted gross margin near 28%. That was enough to let analysts nail the adjusted earnings figure, too. So the final report was completely in line with Wall Street's expectations -- albeit very recently adjusted ones, based on fresh preliminary data.
AMD's inventory increased by 16% during the quarter, partly due to preparing the channel for upcoming holiday season builds, and partly caused by the slow PC components flow. A year ago, inventory rose 10% in the second quarter.
The embedded and semi-custom division accounted for 60% of AMD's sales in the second quarter, up from 46% in the previous quarter, and 42% in the year-ago period. AMD is a company in transition, swearing off the traditional PC market and embracing new opportunities in the embedded market.
This is similar to the way Micron Technology is shifting its memory chip production over from desktop and notebook products and deeper into mobile and embedded chips. Intel is taking a somewhat different path, emphasizing server products more than mobility. But all of these current and former PC giants are looking for new markets right now.
AMD CEO Lisa Su. Image source: AMD.
Can AMD pull this off? The company sold off all of its short-term investment papers during the second quarter, and burned through 8.4% of its total cash equivalents. It ain't easy being AMD right now, and CEO Lisa Su must turn this cash-leaking ship around in short order. If it continues at this rate for a couple more years, AMD will have to find new funding for its day-to-day operations.
The quicker Su can abandon the increasingly hopeless PC market and double down on mobile products plus the booming Internet of Things market, the better. It's already happening, as the sales mix between AMD's two divisions shows. Just, you know, not quite fast enough.
AMD's results were solid enough to slow the share price free fall, but hardly impressive in their own right. The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since that fateful guidance update, and a heart-stopping 53% over the last year. Several analyst houses have ""buy"" ratings on AMD stock with price targets as generous as $5 per share. I wish Lisa Su and her team the best of luck in getting there, but it's a risky and uncertain road with more dangers than opportunities ahead.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently announced a few graphics cards based on its new Fiji graphics processor design. These Fiji-based designs allow AMD to compete at the $549 and $649 price-points that rival graphics processor vendor, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), has dominated for quite some time.
That said, according to website Hardware Luxx , which claims to have spoken to AMD's add-in board partners, AMD is having difficulties supplying enough of its Fiji graphics chips in order to satiate demand. In fact, supplies are reportedly so right that a number of AMD's add-in board partners are apparently unable to launch their own Fiji-based graphics cards.
Although some view such shortages as a good thing (i.e., demand outstripping supply), such a shortage actually seems to be quite negative for AMD. Let me explain.
Fiji tomorrow, or Maxwell today? The first issue here is that the Radeon R9 Fury and the higher-end Radeon R9 Fury X aren't by any means ""clean kills"" in terms of performance, power consumption, or even outright value relative to the NVIDIA competition.
The R9 Fury X, AMD's cream-of-the-crop, is generally believed to be slightly slower than NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 980 Ti offered at the same price point. The $549 Fury, according to TechPowerUp, delivers more performance than the $499 GeForce GTX 980, but loses in terms of performance-per-watt and performance-per-dollar at high-end resolutions (2560-by-1440 and 3840-by-2160).
In addition to a value proposition that isn't so clear, the cards are also reportedly very difficult to find.
Indeed, when I went to Newegg.com (one of the most popular online retailers for computer gear) in search of a Radeon R9 Fury X, I saw the following:

AMD's new GPU is really hard to buy. Source: Newegg.com
To the gamer who wants to buy a Radeon R9 Fury or R9 Fury X today, I say ""good luck.""
In contrast, I seem to have no issue finding all sort of GeForce GTX 980 cards.  There are also plenty of such cards that are designed to run at faster speeds than what NVIDIA runs them at out of the factory, which probably helps close the performance gap between the stock GTX 980 and the R9 Fury.
The same applies to the GeForce GTX 980 Ti; there seem to be plenty of these cards in stock from a variety of vendors. There even seem to be a number of models that run at speeds higher than what NVIDIA specifies them at, which should help widen the performance gap between NVIDIA's best and AMD's best.
AMD needs to improve supply ASAP NVIDIA seems to be in the driver's seat. At the $649-and-up price points, NVIDIA's offerings seem to be widely available and deliver better performance to boot. Against the regular Fury, it seems that there are plenty of GTX 980 models available that would arguably be more attractive to buyers, especially as many factory overclocked versions seem to retail for under $549.
Although having product in greater supply won't fundamentally change the value proposition provided by the Radeon R9 Fury/Fury X, AMD at the very least needs to make sure that cards are available so that users who need to upgrade now (especially those who have been waiting for both AMD and NVIDIA to launch their respective chips) and have a slight preference for AMD will not be swayed by an NVIDIA offering.

            ","Graphics-chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announced its Radeon R9 Fury X flagship graphics processor last month at a $649 price point. The graphics processor was competent, but in third-party performance tests, NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) competing GeForce GTX 980 Ti -- which sells at the same price and launched ahead of the Fury X -- proved to be slightly faster and was also more power-efficient.
As fellow Fool Timothy Green put it, AMD's new offering simply wasn't good enough.
However, the NDAs recently lifted on AMD's Radeon R9 Fury. The Fury is based on the same chip as the higher-end Fury X, but it is partially disabled and air-cooled (as opposed to water-cooled in the case of the Fury X), and as a result, it will be sold for $100 less than its more premium counterpart. 
Although the Fury X failed to deliver the kind of performance and, ultimately, value that some AMD shareholders may have hoped for, might the lower-priced Radeon R9 Fury be a more viable contender in the high-end graphics processor market? Let's take a look.
Performs better than a GTX 980, but costs more The main issue with the Radeon R9 Fury X is that it offered slightly lower performance on average than the GTX 980 Ti but was priced the same as the NVIDIA offering. Given that NVIDIA is widely regarded as the ""premium"" brand and AMD more of the ""value"" brand, it's not clear how successful the Fury X will ultimately be. 
By contrast, the Radeon R9 Fury, according to Tech Power Up, delivers about 7.5% more performance on average than the $499 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 in the site's test suite at 2560-by-1440 resolution and nearly 15% more performance at a more demanding 4K resolution. 
That said, even though the Fury has a performance edge on the 980, the 980 looks more efficient in these tests, delivering better performance per watt at 2560-by-1440 and 4K resolutions than the Radeon R9 Fury X on the order of 19% and 12% respectively. 
In terms of value, the GTX 980 also delivers better performance per dollar than the R9 Fury, although the advantage to the 980 there is 12% at 2560-by-1440 resolution and 5% at 4K resolution.
Is the Radeon R9 Fury a winner? Based on Tech Power Up's tests of average frames per second, it looks like the Radeon R9 Fury is little faster than the GeForce GTX 980, but it's less efficient and offers slightly less performance per dollar.
It's not a bad effort from AMD. But at the price it's asking for this chip, it's hard to see AMD gaining significant amounts of market segment share with the Radeon R9 Fury, given the efficiency and performance-per-dollar deficit of the R9 Fury relative to the GTX 980.
What does this mean for AMD? At this point, I wouldn't be willing to bet on a significant improvement in AMD's graphics-related market segment share. 
That said, I plan to keep a close eye on the financial results and management commentary from both AMD and NVIDIA with respect to graphics to see if there's anything interesting going on with respect to market-share shifts and the potential impact such shifts could have on both graphics vendors' businesses.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has fallen on extremely hard times. In the CPU market, the Intel juggernaut has only grown more dominant in recent years, continually stealing away market share and pushing AMD's PC chip business into the red. In the GPU market, NVIDIA has grown its market share substantially over the past year, shipping 77.5% of discrete GPU's during the first quarter.
With Windows 10 set to launch later this month, the biggest new feature for PC gaming is DirectX 12, Microsoft's new graphics API, the software that allows applications to access the graphics hardware. The biggest improvement that DirectX 12 brings to the table is a vast reduction in overhead, freeing the CPU from wasting time sending commands to the GPU, in part by fully utilizing every core of a multi-core CPU.
Because AMD's CPUs generally have worse single-threaded performance compared with Intel CPUs, DirectX 12 should provide some performance benefits for a PC powered by an AMD CPU or APU. And regardless of the configuration, any game where the CPU is the bottleneck should see improvements in performance.
How much of an improvement will gamers see? Well, according to an article on AMD's website, a massive one:

Source: AMD.
A factor of 16 increase in graphics throughput on AMD's Radeon GPUs sounds impressive, but this slide is a bit deceptive. It measures draw calls, which are commands sent to the GPU from the CPU to draw something. DirectX 12 greatly reduces the overhead involved with each draw call, allowing for this massive increase.
But the number of draw calls is not a measure of performance. The GPU can only draw so much stuff per frame, and what DirectX 12 does is ensure that the GPU will never be waiting for commands from the CPU. The typical way that game developers have dealt with draw call limitations in the past has been to batch objects into the same draw call, thus reducing the total number of draw calls.
DirectX 12 is very similar to Mantle, AMD's now-defunct graphics API, and it's obvious from Mantle benchmarks that real-world situations yield far smaller benefits for AMD's hardware. According to Techspot, using Mantle instead of DirectX 11 produced performance gains around 5% in most cases where a discrete graphics card was used. AMD's APUs, which have integrated graphics, produced bigger gains in some cases, but only because AMD's CPUs are so weak compared with Intel's to begin with.
The actual improvements in frame rates that DirectX 12 delivers will depend on the situation, and while reducing CPU overhead gives game developers extra CPU cycles to work with, performance is ultimately limited by the GPU itself. In situations where the CPU wasn't the bottleneck to begin with, performance gains will be minimal.
Not a game changer for AMD There are certain cases where AMD's CPU will see major improvements in performance with DirectX 12. When the bottleneck is the CPU, the performance gap between AMD's and Intel's processors closes dramatically. Anandtech posted some benchmarks earlier this year that showed AMD's APUs neck-to-neck with Intel when running a very CPU-heavy test.
But in the real world, DirectX 12 doesn't save AMD from the fact that its CPUs are inferior to Intel's in terms of performance. And there's no reason to believe that DirectX 12 will give AMD's GPUs an advantage against NVIDIA, or vice versa. While some tests done by PC Perspective, and cited by AMD, suggests that AMD's R9 290X can deliver more draw calls per second compared to NVIDIA's GTX 980, that's not a meaningful measure of performance. The GTX 980 is substantially more powerful than the 290X, and DirectX 12 doesn't change that.
DirectX 12 is a great development for gamers, delivering a modest performance boost in most cases, and a large performance boost in certain cases. It's also great for developers, freeing them from having to deal with the draw call overhead that plagued DirectX 11. But it doesn't change AMD's competitive position in the CPU or GPU markets. DirectX 12 is no game changer for AMD.

            ","Struggling chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is expected to report its second quarter earnings result and provide guidance for its third quarter on an earnings call scheduled for Thursday, July 16.
The company recently negatively preannounced its second quarter results, stating that revenue will be down 8% from the prior quarter, against prior guidance of a 3% decline, give or take 3%. AMD also said that its gross profit margin for the quarter would be just 28%, down from prior expectations of 32%, as the company's revenue mix shifted more toward lower margin semicustom and embedded chip sales from PC microprocessors.
When AMD reports, here are three things that investors should watch closely.
Second half of 2015 guidance At its Financial Analyst Day, AMD said that it expected its revenue to grow by 15% in the second half of 2015 over that of the first half of 2015. I am looking for a forecast reduction on AMD's part, driven principally by a weaker-than-expected demand for its PC APU products.
Right now, analyst consensus calls for AMD to deliver $4.1 billion in sales for the balance of the year. Given that AMD did $1.03 billion in sales during the first quarter of the year and an 8% reduction from those levels puts sales for the second quarter at roughly $948 million, consensus estimates are calling for just 7.2% growth from the first half of the year to the second half of the year.
If AMD revises guidance for the second half of the year to something greater than a 7.2% increase from the first half, then this could be a positive for the stock. Similarly, if AMD's guidance for the second half comes in lower than that, shares could see further pressure.
Progress in gaining market segment share On the last earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su told analysts that management sees opportunities to grow its market segment share ""particularly in the graphics business"" during the second half of the year. I would be interested to hear management discuss its progress on this front and whether management still thinks it can regain share in the graphics and PC microprocessor markets during the second half of the year.
What about margins? During the first quarter of 2015, AMD's gross profit margin percentage (on a non-GAAP basis) was 32%, and now management expects that figure to come in at 28% in the second quarter.
It will be interesting to see how the company's gross profit margin percentage trends during the second half of 2015, particularly as management's prior margin guidance for the second half of the year was in the range of 32-34%. 
Given that AMD's margins were negatively affected by lower PC processor sales in the second quarter, a downward revision to PC processor shipment expectations might also mean lower margins in the second half of the year. Lower margins, coupled with potentially lower-than-expected revenue, might make it difficult for AMD to hit its forecast of profitability during the second half of the year.
Investing takeawayI'm not expecting much in the way of ""positive surprises"" on the upcoming earnings call. The situation for AMD doesn't look good, and in the near term I don't think there's much that the company can do about it. 
Over the medium term and the long term, AMD is betting on a wave of new products to help improve its competitive positioning in the PC market, grow its semicustom business, regain share in discrete graphics, and reestablish itself as a credible player in the server market.
Whether AMD is able to turn itself around and deliver on the vision that it outlined at its Financial Analyst Day, only time will tell.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is set to report its second-quarter earnings after market close on July 16. After an update from AMD on July 6, which served to cut the company's outlook substantially, the second quarter is expected to be even worse than previously anticipated. AMD now expects revenue to fall 8% sequentially, or about 34% year over year, compared with previous guidance of a 3% sequential decline. As the weak PC market ravages demand for the company's products, AMD is struggling to even predict how bad its results will be.
2015 guidance may need an adjustment Back in May, AMD held an analyst day event, providing an optimistic outlook for the rest of 2015. At the time, AMD expected to be profitable during the second half of the year, producing 15% revenue growth compared to the second half of 2014. Given the major correction to AMD's second quarter guidance, this may need an adjustment.
Along with lowering revenue expectations for the second quarter, AMD announced that it would be taking a $33 million charge associated with moving several product designs, originally designed for a 20nm node, to a leading-edge FinFET node. AMD has previously stated that some 20nm products would launch later this year, probably APUs, but this charge could mean that this is no longer the case.
AMD's optimistic forecast for the second half of the year was based on new products, but if no new APUs are set to be released, AMD will be relying on its recently announced graphics cards to do the job, along with a potential boost in PC demand related to Windows 10. IDC is predicting that the PC market will decline by 6.2% this year, so Windows 10 may not provide any boost at all.
AMD's new high-end Fury graphics cards introduced a real competitor to NVIDIA at the high end of the market after months of allowing NVIDIA free rein. Over the past few quarters, NVIDIA has grown its share of the add-in board market to 77.5%, up from around 60% that has been the norm over the past few years. Simply offering an alternative to NVIDIA should allow AMD to win back some market share, but since AMD failed to truly disrupt the market with its new products, NVIDIA should retain much of its advantage.
This leads to the conclusion that AMD's guidance for the second half is unrealistic, and just two months after first issuing it, I wouldn't be surprised if the company backtracked during its conference call. I don't see a scenario where AMD grows revenue by 15% and returns to profitability in the second half.
How big will the losses be? During the first quarter, AMD posted an operating loss of $137 million, down from an operating profit of $49 million during the first quarter of 2014. There was an $87 million restructuring charge included in that figure, but no matter how you slice it, AMD lost money during the quarter.
The computing and graphics segment posted a $75 million operating loss, down from a slight gain of $3 million during the same period in 2014. Meanwhile, the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment saw its operating profit nearly cut in half, to $45 million. Everything else, including that restructuring charge, contributed a $107 million operating loss.
With demand for PCs weaker than AMD anticipated, I would expect the computing and graphics segment to post an even bigger operating loss during the second quarter. The CPU and APU business is unlikely to improve going into the second half, and while graphics cards may provide a boost to sales, it's hard to imagine the segment posting a profit in the foreseeable future.
AMD can only cut costs so much, and R&D spending has already declined significantly over the past few years. A tech company without adequate R&D isn't going to stand the test of time, and it's becoming more difficult each quarter to believe that AMD can ever become competitive with Intel again. AMD investors still clinging to hopes of a turnaround aren't going to like AMD's second-quarter earnings.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is hurting today. Shares of the microprocessor designer plunged in Monday's after-hours session, setting new 52-week lows in the process. AMD stock opened 17% lower on Tuesday.
The kicker? AMD's dramatic drop follows news that should have been baked into the stock price all along. Investors just forgot all about it, distracted by rumored buyout talks and Father Time.
Right after Monday's closing bell, AMD published an update to its second-quarter guidance figures. And it was all bad news.
Second-quarter sales are now expected to fall 8% sequentially, which works out to roughly $950 million. AMD's original guidance pointed to a smaller 3% drop, or $1.0 billion. Either way, it's a big move from the year-ago quarter's $1.4 billion in total revenue.
At the same time, adjusted gross margin targets were reduced from 32% to 28%. A year ago, that margin sat at 35%.
Image source: AMD.
To explain these reduced expectations, AMD pointed to weak demand for PC systems. The more profitable enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom division accounted for 48% of AMD's sales in the first quarter. That portion will grow in the second period, which should help buttress AMD's margins, but that effect isn't strong enough to overcome the loss of PC-market sales volume.
Moreover, AMD will record a one-time charge of $33 million to account for several product designs moving onto the more advanced FinFET manufacturing process.
If you're wondering how long the design lead times can be in the semiconductor industry, let me point out that AMD first announced its FinFET ambitions 13 years ago, and is only now taking advantage of this hyper-efficient design method. What once was seen as a ""ten-fold performance leap"" is now just another incremental step in the evolution of processor designs. This stuff takes time, people.
But let's get back to the present day. Or rather, to the magical far-away haze of two weeks ago.
That's when memory chip producer Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) announced terrible second-quarter results and equally weak forward guidance, all due to a soft PC market. As investors digested this hard-hitting prognosis, Micron's shares fell 22% over the next two trading days. AMD followed suit with a 9% plunge of its own. Even industry titan Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) took that news on the chin, as shares lost 5% of their value.
Intel and Micron have stayed down since that fateful report, but AMD hasn't. According to the rumor mill, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) weighed buying out AMD to gain control of the Xbox One's central processor technology (which also underpins the PS4 and Wii U rival systems). The buyout looks like a bad idea for Microsoft, and even if these talks are real, they're not likely to result in an AMD buyout.
Still, the mere hint of a positive exit strategy was enough to hold AMD shares aloft. As of Monday night, the stock had rebounded nearly 6% from the darkest hours of Micron's PC industry revelations.
The Microsoft buffer is all gone now and then some. Again, AMD is trading at multiyear lows this morning. AMD is set to report full results on July 16, the day after Intel's second-quarter update. After these two announcements, we'll know a lot more about the overall health of the PC markets -- and it won't be a pretty picture.
But you can't say that Micron didn't warn you. AMD only underscored what we had already been told.

            ","What: Shares of semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell as much as 18% on very heavy volume in the early Tuesday session. The company yesterday reduced its second-quarter guidance, one week before the final report. By 11:15 a.m., the stock was down 15.4%.
So what: In a guidance update published Monday night, AMD reduced its second-quarter revenue guidance from $1 billion to roughly $950 million. The gross margin outlook was also diminished from 32% to 28%, all due to unexpectedly slow orders from the PC systems sector.
Now what: AMD shares had already taken a recent haircut when fellow semiconductor veteran Micron Technology blamed a weak second quarter on PC-market troubles. The stock recovered nicely amid buyout speculation, but this late-hour guidance reduction took all the wind out of AMD's sails in short order. AMD shares hit multiyear lows in early Tuesday trading.
Investors are now looking back at a steep 50% price drop in AMD shares over the last year, and this PC market update doesn't indicate a quick end to the misery. Recently appointed CEO Lisa Su faces an incredibly difficult turnaround task here, and maybe even an impossible one.
Tune in to AMD's full earnings report on July 16 for a deeper dive into this troubled company's progress and prospects (or lack thereof). Until then, rest assured that PC vendors aren't building a ton of systems right now. Expect the back-to-school and holiday seasons to show lower PC sales than usual, with all that implies for component suppliers to that sector.

            ","Just 10 days from its formal earnings release, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) pre-announced that its revenue for the quarter will come in lower than expected. In particular, AMD is now calling for an 8% sequential drop in sales from the first quarter, a significantly larger decline than the 3% drop it had originally called for.
This weakness, per AMD's press release, has been driven by ""weaker than expected consumer PC demand,"" leading to lower APU sales to system vendors.
AMD also reduced its gross profit margin guidance for the quarter (on a non-GAAP basis) from 32% to just 28%. This reduction is due to a ""higher mix of Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment sales,"" as a result of the aforementioned PC weakness.
Finally, the company announced that its GAAP gross profit margin will take a one-time hit associated with scrapping product designs that had been started on the 20-nanometer manufacturing node but are now being transitioned to FinFET manufacturing.
Although AMD laid out an optimistic long-term view at its recent Financial Analyst Day, the reality here is that AMD's business seems to be going from ""bad"" to ""worse."" 
Is this ""just"" a PC problem, or is it an AMD problem? It won't be too long now before both AMD and PC processor peer Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) report their full quarterly results. A question that will be of critical importance to AMD is whether this revenue shortfall is due just to the rough shape the PC market's in, or if AMD is continuing to lose significant market share to Intel.
My guess is that the full quarterly results from both chipmakers will show a combination of both. I expect that Intel's Skylake chips will offer better performance per watt than anything AMD will be able to field this year. Furthermore, given the status of the PC market and that Intel has factories to keep filled, I wouldn't be surprised if Intel gets more aggressive on pricing its chips in a bid to capture additional market share.  
Will guidance for the second half of the year need to come down? At AMD's financial analyst day back in May, CFO Devinder Kumar said the company expects to grow revenue by 15%, give or take 3%, in the second half of the year from levels seen in the first half of 2015. Additionally, Kumar said AMD's gross profit margin will move from 32% in the first half to 32%-34% in the second half and operating expenses would come down from $715 million to between $680 million and $700 million.
All told, that prior guidance called for AMD to see a net profit and positive free cash flow in the second half of the year.
I expect AMD to bring down its full-year revenue guidance, although by how much isn't clear yet. In its prior guidance for the second half of the year, AMD was looking for operating profit of about $69 million (assuming $2.3 billion in sales, 33% gross profit margin, and $690 million in operating expenses).
Note that AMD brought in $1.03 billion in revenue last quarter and now expects revenue for the second quarter to be down by 8% from that level, implying a first half of 2015 revenue base of about $1.98 billion.
If AMD lowers its second-half growth estimates to 10% from 15% (which still might be optimistic) and hits the low end of its previously stated gross profit margin (32%-34%) and operating expense ($680 million-$700 million) ranges, it could still eke out a $17 million operating profit for the second half of the year.
However, if AMD guides for revenue growth in the second half of the year that's meaningfully lower than that, or if its gross margin comes under further pressure, then AMD could very well wind up losing money in the second half of the year as well.
Things don't look good for AMD today and it's hard to see things getting much better anytime soon.

            ","Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is rumored to be interested in acquiring chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), according to recent reports from Reuters and KitGuru. The takeover talks reportedly started a few months ago, although additional details are currently unknown.
AMD currently has a market cap of $1.8 billion, and Microsoft has $95.3 billion in cash, so it would be an easy purchase for the tech giant. But before investors get too excited about this buzz reviving AMD stock -- which has fallen more than 40% over the past 12 months -- they should understand that these rumors are unlikely to bear fruit.

Source: AMD.
Possible reasons for buying AMDAMD has been losing ground to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in x86 processors and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphics cards for years, yet it recently found a comfortable niche with SoCs (system on chips) for gaming consoles. AMD currently provides the SoCs for Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One -- the two top consoles of the current generation.
Microsoft and Sony both pay AMD roughly $100 per console for those SoCs, which merge the CPU and GPU on a single chip. Microsoft has sold 12.6 million Xbox Ones since late 2013, which equals $1.26 billion in payments to AMD. Therefore, buying AMD to save the gross profits on those payments (estimated to be about 20%) sounds like a good idea. Sony would be ironically forced to pay Microsoft to keep using AMD SoCs if Microsoft bought AMD, and Microsoft could further lower the price of the Xbox One to undercut the PS4.

The Xbox One. Source: Microsoft.
AMD claims that its graphically powerful SoCs are well-suited for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications. If Microsoft acquires AMD, it could install those SoCs in the HoloLens AR headset and similar devices. AMD also owns a software suite for VR headsets, known as LiquidVR, which reduces the lag in VR image processing that can cause motion sickness. That software, which only works with AMD hardware, could be useful if Microsoft expands its presence into the VR market.
But here's the problemMicrosoft and AMD certainly have some aligned interests, but AMD has huge flaws that could offset any synergistic gains. AMD's business is split into two parts -- the Computing & Graphics (x86 chips, GPUs, and graphics cards) division and the Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (SoCs, embedded chips) one.
Last quarter, revenue at Computing & Graphics, which accounted for 52% of AMD's top line, fell 38% annually to $532 million, and its operating loss widened from $39 million to $107 million. This was due to lower PC sales and competitive pressure, which forced AMD to lower prices to preserve market share.
AMD's EESC business, which generated the remaining 48% of its top line last quarter, fared slightly better. Sales slipped just 7% annually to $498 million, but operating income dropped 47% to $45 million. AMD blamed ""seasonally lower sales"" of semi-custom SoCs, hinting that rising sales of consoles wasn't enough to lift the entire business. Therefore, it's impractical for Microsoft to inherit all those problems just to cut the cost of the Xbox One or gain an early edge in the fledgling AR/VR markets.
A partial sale wouldn't workTo cut off the burnt crust, Microsoft could theoretically buy AMD's EESC division and leave the Computing & Graphics unit with AMD. Unfortunately, AMD probably wouldn't agree to that partial sale for two reasons.
First, the SoCs which Microsoft needs are based on technologies developed for its server microprocessors and high-end graphics cards. Selling one unit without the other would cause a major fracture in R&D. Second, the EESC business is AMD's only way to offset the ongoing losses at its Computing & Graphics division.
But even if AMD sold the EESC business to Microsoft, the division's lackluster bottom-line growth would weigh down Microsoft's earnings, which are already under pressure from offering free/discounted Windows licenses and year-long trial offers of Office 365. Analysts are already expecting Microsoft's earnings to drop 8% this year, and buying AMD -- either as a whole or in bits -- would likely lead to downward revisions.
Shop elsewhere, MicrosoftAMD's market cap is basically pocket change for Microsoft, but inheriting all of AMD's problems simply wouldn't be worth the effort. Over the past two years, Microsoft has bought plenty of smaller companies to boost its cloud business, which had an annual run rate of $6.3 billion last quarter. Therefore, it makes more sense to buy smaller CRM, machine learning, or analytics firms to grow its cloud business than it does to acquire a fallen chipmaker like AMD.

After months of speculation and waiting, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) finally took the wraps off of its new high-end graphics cards. The fastest of the bunch, the Fury X, is priced at $649, meant to compete directly with NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) identically priced GTX 980 Ti. With new high-bandwidth memory and a water-cooling solution, the Fury X is certainly an impressive piece of hardware. But while AMD has successfully closed the performance gap with NVIDIA at the high end, it failed to launch anything truly disruptive.

The Fury X with liquid cooling solution. Source: AMD.
A look at the Fury X AMD actually announced two lines of new graphics cards in June. The Radeon 300 series encompasses rebrands of the company's previous Radeon 200 series, while three high-end cards, the Nano, the Fury, and the Fury X, are built on a new iteration of AMD's Graphics Core Next architecture. These high-end cards come with high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, and the Fury X sports 8.6 teraflops of single-precision floating point performance.
AMD has built a very fast graphics card with state-of-the-art memory technology, and its water-cooling solution allows the Fury X to be about 3 inches shorter than AMD's previous flagship, the 290X. After months of being unable to effectively compete with NVIDIA at the high end of the market, the Fury X officially puts AMD back in the game.
In terms of performance, the Fury X is very close to the GTX 980 Ti. In a review on Tom's Hardware, the reviewer said the Fury X delivers performance surreally similar to NVIDIA's 980 Ti, with the 980 Ti having a slight advantage at lower resolutions and the Fury X having a slight advantage at higher resolutions.
AMD's use of HBM doesn't seem to give the Fury X any discernible advantage. The fraction of gamers playing at 4K resolutions, where the Fury X is at its best against the 980 Ti, is still minuscule, according to Steam's hardware and software survey. 4K gaming will certainly become more prevalent as the price of 4K monitors comes down, but with NVIDIA expected to use HBM in its upcoming Pascal graphics cards in 2016, being first might not yield any benefits at all for AMD.
What it means for AMD When AMD launched its previous lineup of graphics cards, the Radeon 200 series, in 2013, the company successfully disrupted NVIDIA. With the flagship 290X boasting better performance and a lower price than NVIDIA's high-end offerings, NVIDIA was forced to slash prices on its graphics cards in order to compete.
NVIDIA returned the favor when it launched its GTX 970 and 980 last September. NVIDIA priced its new high-end cards extremely aggressively, forcing AMD to slash prices. The GTX 970, which cost about $330 at launch, wasn't too far off from the performance of AMD's 290X, which was priced at $550 at the time. And the GTX 980 vastly outperformed every single AMD GPU graphics card available.
This trend of NVIDIA and AMD constantly leapfrogging each other comes to an end with the launch of the Fury X. Instead of disrupting NVIDIA, AMD has simply matched its rival, offering the same performance for the same price. While NVIDIA had the high end of the market largely to itself since September, AMD will not enjoy the same advantage.
AMD will almost certainly win back some market share at the high end, the result of simply having a viable alternative to NVIDIA's products. Over the past few quarters, NVIDIA has vastly increased its market share of the discrete GPU market, and I suspect some of these gains will now be erased.
But without truly disruptive products from AMD, NVIDIA will likely remain the market leader for the foreseeable future. Instead of both companies leapfrogging each other with each new product launch, NVIDIA has taken a leap forward, and AMD has taken months to simply catch up.
This could be the inevitable result of AMD slashing its research and development budget over the past few years. NVIDIA actually surpassed AMD in R&D spending in 2013, despite AMD having a far broader business, competing in PC CPUs, server CPUs, and discrete graphics cards.
AMD's Fury X is an impressive graphics card, but it's not good enough. AMD needed to disrupt NVIDIA, but Fury X doesn't do that. While AMD will likely reclaim some market share, the company runs the risk of being permanently stuck in second place behind NVIDIA.

            ","The lower shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) go, the wilder the buyout rumors seem to get. This time, we have KitGuru reporting that it's heard that software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is interested in buying the struggling chipmaker.
Microsoft reportedly ""approached AMD several months ago,"" but the results of the talks are ""unclear,"" according to the report.
Details of this rumored acquisition end there, but KitGuru's Anton Shilov suggests that buying AMD could help Microsoft save ""around a billion per year on Xbox One chips."" He then further suggests that if Microsoft could get AMD to put together ""appropriate chips for smartphones and tablets,"" Microsoft could save even more money.
I think this ""rumor"" is unlikely to have much substance, and the cited rationale behind such a deal is tenuous at best. Here's why.
How much money would Microsoft really save on Xbox One chips? The first argument that Shilov makes is that Microsoft could save about ""a billion per year"" by no longer having to pay a third party to buy chips for the Xbox One. However, it's my understanding that Microsoft essentially funds the development of the chip upfront, relieving AMD of the R&D burden associated with the chip development.
In exchange for funding the development, the per-unit margins that AMD is able to command when it actually sells these chips to the customer are lower.
According to AMD CFO Devinder Kumar on the company's Q1 2014 earnings call, gross profit margin on the game console chips is lower than the corporate average. Given that AMD reported 35% gross profit margin in that quarter, we can assume that console chip gross profit margins were lower than that.
To figure out just how much Microsoft would save on console chips if it didn't have to hand over any margins, let's assume that the chips bring in a 30% gross profit margin for AMD. This would mean that Microsoft would save -- assuming KitGuru's figure of $1 billion worth of console chip sales per year -- $300 million per year in Xbox chip cost of goods sold.
It hardly seems likely that Microsoft would want to buy the entirety of AMD just to save $300 million per year on semi-custom game console chips.
Chips for smartphones and tablets? Shilov also says that AMD could help Microsoft put together smartphone processors for tablets and phones, presumably for Microsoft's Surface tablets and its Lumia line of smartphones.
The smartphone hypothesis makes no sense, as AMD's CPU and graphics IP doesn't appear to be targeted at smartphones, and good IP can be licensed from the likes of ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) and Imagination (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). AMD doesn't bring to the table any modem technology, either, which is critical for smartphones. If Microsoft were really interested building phone chips, AMD is hardly the go-to M&A target for that.
In tablets, such an acquisition might make a little more sense, since AMD brings to the table an X86 license. However, I don't think Microsoft has the scale with its Surface and Surface Pro line of systems to justify the huge R&D expense of trying to out-engineer Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) low-power X86 offerings.
This just doesn't sound plausible I'd say that this rumored acquisition is highly unlikely. As of writing, the rumor seems to be pushing the stock higher in after-hours trading, but I wouldn't be surprised if any buyout-rumor gains eventually evaporate -- as they have many times in the past.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has confirmed that it will finally be announcing its new slate of graphics cards on June 16. Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has had the high-end GPU market mostly to itself since launching the GTX 970 and GTX 980 last September at aggressive prices.
Just a couple of weeks before AMD's event, and just a couple of months after launching the powerful GTX Titan X, NVIDIA has once again disrupted the market with the GTX 980 Ti. The $649 graphics card is nearly as fast as the $999 Titan X, and it's capable of playing games at a 4K resolution. AMD's task of winning back market share just became more difficult.
A look at the GTX 980 Ti The eventual launch of a Ti variant of the GTX 980 was inevitable, but it is surprising that it came so soon after the launch of the Titan X. It's also surprising how close in performance the 980 Ti comes to the Titan X. While the 980 Ti sports about 8% fewer CUDA cores and texture units, and cuts the Titan X's 12GB of memory in half, real-world performance is very similar for both cards. Anandtech did a full review, and its conclusion was that there is only a 3% difference in performance between the two cards, despite the Titan X being priced $350 higher.

Source: NVIDIA
NVIDIA has essentially made the Titan X irrelevant, a bizarre move on the surface. But with AMD's new graphics cards on the way, NVIDIA likely wanted to be proactive. Instead of allowing AMD to launch a new high-end card at a lower price than the Titan X before launching a response, NVIDIA has come out swinging with the 980 Ti, putting pressure on AMD.
AMD has a problem There has been no shortage of rumors regarding AMD's upcoming graphics cards over the past few months. What we know is that the highest-end GPUs will sport high-bandwidth-memory, or HBM, which should give AMD's cards an advantage at the highest of resolutions. What we don't know is how much this new memory technology will add to the price of AMD's cards, or how it will ultimately perform compared to the new 980 Ti.
Some unofficial benchmarks of AMD's new high-end cards have leaked, showing that AMD's top new product performs about the same as the Titan X and the 980 Ti. That sounds about right, although we'll have to wait for official benchmarks to know for sure.
If AMD's highest-end GPU is in the same ballpark as the 980 Ti in terms of performance, the company is going to be unable to charge much more than $650. Previous rumors put the launch price of AMD's highest-end card at $899, which would likely be a non-starter given the 980 Ti's price, so my guess is that the card will ultimately launch at a lower price.
AMD is playing catch up to NVIDIA, and that puts the company in a difficult situation. NVIDIA has run away with the discrete GPU market in recent quarters, accounting for 76% of shipments during the fourth quarter of 2014, and AMD is going to have to blow away potential customers with its new products in order to win much of that market share back. Simply matching NVIDIA on performance is unlikely to turn things around for the company.
NVIDIA's strategy makes sense While essentially making the Titan X obsolete with the launch of the 980 Ti, NVIDIA has managed to back AMD into a corner. While NVIDIA had the freedom to sell a $1,000 high-end graphics card for months without any real competition, AMD has a hard limit on how much it can charge, assuming that the performance of its flagship card is similar to that of the 980 Ti.
We'll soon find out if AMD has any tricks up its sleeve, or if the company's adoption of HBM gives it an advantage. But at the moment, NVIDIA appears to be in control.

What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), better known as AMD, fell by $0.02, or less than 1%, in Tuesday's trading session, closing at $2.29. This was despite receiving a very bullish rating initiation from one Wall Street firm, which believes AMD's shares could more than double.
So what: Gus Richard, the covering analyst at Northland Capital, initiated coverage on AMD yesterday with an ""outperform"" rating (the equivalent of a ""buy"") and a price target of $5 per share. If AMD were to hit Richard's target, it would deliver a 118% return to shareholders.
Richard's bullish thesis amid a sea of skepticism surrounding AMD involves the expected growth of data centers and the reliance on x86-compatible chips. The only two companies that supply chips in this realm are chip-making powerhouse Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD. Because Richards believes that rewriting the software that's the backbone of today's data centers would take a lot of time and effort, he contends that x86 will ""continue to dominate the server market.""
Richard also believes that even if x86 loses its grasp in data centers in the U.S., AMD could be an attractive takeover target. Richard cites a number of possible suitors in his note to investors, including Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), Intel, and potentially a China-based company since China is heavily dependent on x86 processors.
Richard estimates that AMD could have about 10% market share in data center processors by 2017 (or about $1 billion in sales), which should lead to gross margin expansion and EPS of $0.50 for the full year.
Source: AMD via Facebook.
Now what: The real question that investors need to ask here is whether you trust Northland Capital's assessment or believe AMD is a dead duck.
On a fundamental basis it's tough to argue against the dead duck theory. AMD is in the midst of a multi-year businesses turnaround that continues to be pushed out by a weakening PC market and the heavy spending required to enter highly competitive next-generation product markets, such as the cloud, gaming, and data centers. Wall Street projects that AMD will lose money on an annual basis until 2017. However, unlike Richard's $0.50 EPS estimate for the full-year, Wall Street's consensus is a mere $0.03 profit.
However, playing second fiddle to Intel can have its perks, too. Even maintaining 10%-15% market share in data centers could net AMD substantial growth in the coming decade. Additionally, AMD has a growing presence in gaming consoles and has made significant headway in gaining microserver market share.
Personally, I've been weighing an investment in AMD for some time now, and I'm liking its potential for a turnaround. I would suggest that only those with a high tolerance for risk even consider investing in AMD, since it does have a number of competitive challenges yet to overcome. However, with new management in place and AMD targeting higher growth prospects, I suspect it's only a matter of time before the company puts its struggles firmly in the rearview mirror.

            ","The wait for new graphics cards from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is nearly over. After losing quite a bit of market share to rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past few quarters, AMD is expected to launch new products by the end of June. NVIDIA has had the high-end of the market mostly to itself after launching the GTX 970 and 980 last September, and the GTX Titan X in March -- AMD desperately needs to reclaim some market share.
But putting out competitive hardware will not be enough. A little more than one year ago, NVIDIA officially introduced GameWorks, a set of tools and code libraries that provide game developers with the ability to easily integrate advanced effects into their games. I wrote last year that GameWorks had the potential to give NVIDIA a competitive advantage in the GPU business. With the hoopla surrounding the recently released PC game, The Witcher 3, and its use of GameWorks, it appears as though that is exactly what's happening.
NVIDIA has a software advantage Software has always been important in the GPU business in the form of graphics drivers. This is the software that allows a PC to communicate with the GPU itself, and both AMD and NVIDIA continually update their drivers to work better with new and existing games.
However, you only have to look at the NVIDIA and AMD support websites to see that NVIDIA provides driver updates far more frequently. The latest official NVIDIA driver was released on May 18th, providing a variety of fixes and optimizations for The Witcher 3. On the other hand, the latest official AMD driver was released all the way back in December of last year, and its latest beta driver, which provided optimizations for Grand Theft Auto V, is more than a month old.
This discrepancy may simply be an issue of resources. AMD used to provide monthly driver updates, but it ended that practice back in 2012. This coincided with the beginning of a three-year streak of annual losses for the company, one which may turn into a four-year streak in 2015.
While NVIDIA and AMD routinely work with game developers to optimize games for their respective hardware, GameWorks takes things one step further. GameWorks provides code for advanced effects like soft shadows, high-quality skin shading, and the simulation and rendering of realistic hair and fur. These are all complicated and computationally intensive effects, and GameWorks saves developers from needing to reinvent the wheel.
GameWorks is obviously optimized to work best on NVIDIA hardware, and in certain cases, it works very poorly on AMD hardware. The Witcher 3 makes use of GameWorks' hair and fur rendering, and the developer has stated that it encourages users of AMD GPUs to disable the feature completely, because performance may be unacceptable due to the lack of optimizations with AMD hardware.
AMD is working on new beta drivers that fix these performance issues, but it may be too little, too late. GameWorks' hair and fur rendering was demoed in The Witcher 3 last year, so AMD had plenty of time to develop optimized drivers that were ready to go at launch. Again, a lack of resources compared to NVIDIA was likely the main issue.
What AMD needs to do New GPUs alone will not solve AMD's market share problems. GameWorks and other NVIDIA technologies are finding their way into an increasing number of PC games, and AMD needs to fight back with its own software. AMD's Mantle, the graphics API that the company developed as an alternative to DirectX, is now dead. Although it certainly influenced the development of DirectX 12, it did nothing to boost sales of AMD products, as I previously predicted.
AMD needs its own version of GameWorks. It needs to release optimized drivers at the same frequency as NVIDIA, and it needs to ensure that any performance issues are resolved before games are launched, not after. With AMD currently unprofitable and its resources spread across various businesses beyond graphics, catching up with NVIDIA on the software front will be a challenge, to say the least.

            ","Over the past few years, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has struggled with losing market share in the x86 and graphics chip markets against rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). To avoid directly competing against those two market leaders, AMD has expanded into smaller niche markets.
Two such markets are augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), which AMD highlighted as ""key drivers"" of future growth during its analyst day in early May. AMD stated that the AR and VR markets could grow from nearly nothing today to $150 billion by 2020, citing research firm Digi-Capital's estimates. 80% of that revenue is expected to come from AR devices, while the remaining 20% will be attributed to VR ones.

Source: AMD.
Will AMD really profit from that growth, or is it merely pegging its name to a hyped-up fledgling market?
Why AMD believes in AR and VRAMD believes it can naturally evolve its presence in the gaming industry into the AR and VR markets. AMD's APUs (advanced processing units) combine CPUs with GPUs (graphics processor units) on a single chip, making them ideal all-in-one solutions for devices that require heavy graphical processing horsepower. Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One -- the two top-selling eighth-generation gaming consoles -- both use AMD's semi-custom low-power APUs.
Therefore, Sony and Microsoft's upcoming AR/VR headsets will be directly powered by AMD's APUs if they're hooked up to consoles. In 2016, Sony will launch Project Morpheus, its VR headset for the PS4. Microsoft will also eventually launch HoloLens, an AR headset that overlays virtual objects onto real things, for Xbox One and Windows PCs.

Intel's HD Graphics and NVIDIA's Project Denver are also all-in-one APU chipsets, but neither one matches AMD's presence in console gaming.
A growing marketSony and Microsoft aren't the only companies expanding into the AR/VR market. Facebook is expected to launch its VR headset, Oculus Rift, in 2016. Google got developers interested in VR apps with its DIY Cardboard headset, then partnered with Mattel to transform its classic View-Master into a VR viewing device. Google also invested over half a billion dollars into Magic Leap, the developer of an AR headset that could potentially compete against HoloLens.

The arrival of those headsets will boost demand for beefier GPUs. However, some of them will need to be paired with mobile devices and PCs -- neither of which is AMD's forte. The mobile GPU market currently belongs to Qualcomm and Apple. Intel controls 72% of the overall GPU market, while NVIDIA controls 76% of the add-in graphics board market, according to research company JPR.
AMD's lack of GPU muscle in those markets could impact its ability to grow its AR/VR presence beyond gaming consoles. Moreover, there's no guarantee that Sony and Microsoft won't switch to NVIDIA or another chipmaker for APUs in future consoles.
Don't forget about the softwareHowever, AMD has an alternative way to infiltrate the VR market: software. In March, AMD unveiled LiquidVR, a suite of technologies designed to reduce delays, or latency, in VR image processing, which can cause motion sickness. The suite only works with VR content running on AMD hardware. Several major AR/VR partners, including Facebook's Oculus VR, are already integrating LiquidVR into their devices.
Until now, reducing latency was mainly considered a hardware issue. Last year, NVIDIA claimed its GeForce GTX 980 could reduce the Oculus Rift's latency by up to 50% in comparison to older cards. However, the GTX 980 is a top-tier card that costs $500-$600. Add that to the expected $200-$400 price tag for the Rift, and customers might have to pay $1,000 for an optimal VR experience.
With LiquidVR, VR applications might eventually run smoothly on cheaper graphics cards. The suite is also an early step toward a unified API for VR gaming, which could attract a lot more developers and vendors as the market matures.
Not a magic bulletThe AR/VR market is an exciting market to watch, but it's not a magic bullet to solve AMD's core problems.
Last quarter, revenue at both AMD's Computing & Graphics unit and its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) unit fell annually. The former posted an operating loss of $75 million, while the latter -- which houses AMD's higher-growth console and microserver SoCs -- stayed in the black, with an operating profit of $45 million. 
Rising sales of VR/AR devices might boost console sales, which could cast a halo effect on sales of PC-based add-in graphics boards. If the VR market matures and LiquidVR becomes an industry standard, AMD could possibly sell cheaper add-in graphics boards that can match the VR performance of pricier NVIDIA cards. 
Unfortunately, none of that will likely happen within the coming year. Until then, AMD must find other ways to get its top- and bottom-line growth back on track.

            ","During the past few years, Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) strategy has not made a lot of sense. The company has been trying to compete with Intel in both the PC and server chip markets, while at the same time facing off against NVIDIA in the GPU market, only to find itself losing market share across the board. On top of that, AMD has launched a variety of ambitious initiatives, despite the fact that its research and development spending has been slashed in each of the past three years.
Earlier this month, AMD held its 2015 Financial Analyst Day, and it seems that the company is finally taking the proper steps to narrow its focus and turn the business around. There are still no guarantees, and returning to profitability will be a difficult task, but it looks like AMD is finally doing something right.
Picking its spots During its financial analyst day presentation, AMD listed four recent challenges: a weak PC market, channel inventory, market share losses, and investments not being sufficiently focused. It is the last point that has caused most of AMD's problems. The company has been throwing its limited resources behind all sorts of initiatives, and this lack of focus has allowed the competition to continually win market share.
About a year ago, AMD announced Project SkyBridge, an initiative to create a single platform for both x86 and ARM CPUs. Project SkyBridge is now dead, and the company's custom K12 ARM core has been delayed to 2017. These decisions are likely for the best: Project SkyBridge was too ambitious for AMD, and with the ARM server market still in its nascent stages, rushing a custom ARM core to market makes little sense.
Along with scaling back its ARM ambitions, AMD is exiting its SeaMicro dense server business. AMD acquired SeaMicro in 2012 for $334 million in an attempt to take advantage of the growth in micro-servers. However, as CEO Lisa Su stated during the latest conference call, the market has not developed fast enough, and AMD's core competency is processors, not systems. That is $334 million wasted and a costly lesson learned.
The most important part of its new strategy isn't where the company is focusing but where the company isn't focusing. AMD is not going after the smartphone market or the low-end tablet market, and it is reducing its exposure to the low-end of the PC market. And while the Internet of Things is expected to be a huge opportunity in the coming years, the company will not be putting its chips into IoT endpoints such as smartwatches and smart appliances.
These decisions are the right ones. There is simply no way that AMD can compete in these markets against Intel and companies making ARM chips. Intel barely has a presence in smartphones today, and it had to heavily subsidize its tablet chips to gain market share. That is despite Intel spending billions maintaining its state-of-the-art fabrication facilities and outspending AMD on research and development by more than a factor of 10.
The plan to win market share The key to the new CPU strategy is Zen, the new high-performance core expected to launch in 2016. AMD is now focusing on the high-end of the PC market. With Intel currently facing essentially no competition there, it is likely the best opportunity to win back some PC market share. Zen is also the key to AMD's server strategy, and the company hopes to gain server market share starting in 2017.
With Zen, AMD has switched to using simultaneous multithreading -- what Intel calls Hyper-Threading. In its previous CPU architecture, AMD used a different form of multithreading, and this contributed to its lackluster performance compared to Intel chips. Zen should help close the performance gap.
In the GPU market, AMD has been losing market share to NVIDIA for the past few quarters, but the company plans to launch new GPUs in the next few months. These will be the first to use high-bandwidth memory, which should give the new cards an advantage when it comes to gaming at 4K resolutions. NVIDIA will likely launch some new GPUs in response, so there is again no guarantee that AMD will be able to regain ground in the market.
AMD is still going to have a tough time winning market share in the CPU and GPU markets, but for the first time in years, its strategy make sense. The company no longer appears to be flailing, pushing all sorts of initiatives and trying to compete on multiple fronts. Instead, AMD is starting to focus on the areas where it has the best chance at being competitive, and that should be a welcome development for investors.

            ","Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have fallen 43% over the past 12 months. Its core CPU and GPU businesses were respectively marginalized by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA, which caused AMD's average selling prices to fall across the board. A slowdown in the PC market exacerbated that pain.
Last quarter, AMD reported a net loss of $180 million, compared to a loss of $20 million a year earlier. Revenue plunged 26% year over year to $1.03 billion. Although many investors believe there's not much value left in AMD stock, let's take a contrarian view and discuss three ways the chipmaker could save itself.
1. Expanding into Chromebooks and IoT chipsAMD hasn't made chips for Chromebooks or Internet of Things, or IoT, devices, while Intel has embraced both high-growth markets. Research firm Gartner expects Chromebooks to claim 4.3% of the PC market by 2017, up from 1.5% in 2014. IDC expects the total IoT market to grow from $1.9 trillion in 2013 to $7.1 trillion by 2020.

Chromebooks. Source: Google.
AMD's reasoning was the same for both: it didn't want to weigh down its bottom line with low-margin products. Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster called Chromebooks a ""rock-bottom"" market at the ISSCC conference in February. In January, AMD's since-departed computing and graphics chief John Byrne told VentureBeat that he wasn't ""in the business to lose money"" when it came to selling IoT chips.
Yet by avoiding both markets, AMD ignores two key facts. Selling low-margin chips would still generate fresh revenue growth. Considering that AMD's computing and graphics revenue plunged 38% annually last quarter, it wouldn't be a terrible idea. Second, it ignores economies of scale: if AMD can sell low margin products at sufficiently high volumes, the cost per unit could drop.
AMD probably isn't confident that it can sell enough Chromebook or IoT chips to bring those costs down. If it failed to do so, the unit's operating loss -- which already stood at $75 million last quarter -- could widen. Nonetheless, AMD shouldn't prematurely dismiss those two opportunities for growth.
2. Spinning off its computing and graphics divisionConsidering how poorly the computing and graphics division has fared, it might be wise to spin off or sell the unit. After all, the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom, or EESC, unit generates plenty of revenue on its own:
1Q Revenue

% of 1Q Revenue
Computing & Graphics
$532 million

52%
EESC

48%
Source: AMD quarterly earnings report.
Moreover, AMD's EESC business remains profitable, although its operating income fell 47% year over year to $45 million last quarter. The EESC business is mainly propped up by sales of system-on-chips for Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4, but it has also expanded into microservers, which IDC forecasts will account for 10% of all servers by 2016.
Unfortunately, AMD recently shuttered its SeaMicro brand of microservers, which were considered a potential showcase for its new ARM-based processors. Other microserver makers could still install AMD's ARM-based processors in their microservers, but there are already plenty of other ARM-based microserver chipmakers in that field, such as Texas Instruments. 
If AMD sells its computing and graphics division, it could invest that cash back into strengthening its EESC business. However, the EESC unit might be too dependent on IP from the Computing and Graphics segment, and the two businesses could be too tightly intertwined to be separated. Moreover, if AMD becomes even smaller, it could lose whatever pricing power it has left in the market.  
3. Sell itself to mobile chipmakersTherefore, a better option would be for AMD to shop itself around to potential buyers. With a market cap of just $1.8 billion, AMD could be easily acquired by a larger chipmaker such as Samsung or Qualcomm.

Both companies, which make ARM-based chips, would benefit from acquiring AMD's license to manufacture x86 chips. That could help either one expand from mobile devices and into Intel's core market of laptops and desktops.
However, it's not that simple. Any company that buys AMD would also inherit the company's $2.3 billion in debt. AMD also had a negative free cash flow of $163 million over the past 12 months, and has less than $1 billion in cash and short-term holdings. Meanwhile, both of its business units are posting negative top- and bottom-line growth.
The takeawayAMD isn't a safe stock by any means. These three lifesaving strategies are long shots that might never happen. However, they offer valuable insights into AMD's previous business decisions, and highlight the value that might remain in its core businesses.

            ","Chipmakers AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have certainly seen better days. Shares of AMD have fallen over 40% in the past 12 months, while shares of Qualcomm are down over 10%. On the other hand, Intel -- which competes against AMD in x86 CPUs and Qualcomm in mobile chips -- is up nearly 25%. 
However, bottom-fishing investors might be wondering if AMD or Qualcomm make good contrarian picks. Let's take a look at both companies to see which one is a better ""bad news buy.""
AMD: Stuck between two giantsA decade ago, AMD realized that it could not compete directly against Intel and its dominant market share in x86 chips. As a result, AMD acquired graphics card maker ATI in 2006 to diversify its top line with high-end graphics cards and APUs. But between the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2014, Nvidia increased its market share of add-in graphic boards from 65% to 76%, according to research firm JPR. AMD saw its share fall from 35% to 24%.
To avoid being crushed between Intel and Nvidia, AMD focused on strengthening its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) segment, which includes server and embedded processors, SoC products, engineering services, and royalties. The EESC unit received a major boost when Microsoft and Sony put its SoCs in the Xbox One and PS4, respectively.

As a result, the EESC unit grew as its CPU and GPU businesses faded. But as investors saw during the first quarter, growth in the EESC unit is also slowing down:

Average selling prices fell across the board. As a result, the computing and graphics unit posted an operating loss of $75 million, down from a profit of $3 million a year earlier. Operating income at EESC plunged 47% year-over-year to $45 million.
Qualcomm: an existential crisisQualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of mobile SoCs and wireless modems in the world. That puts it in a solid position to profit from the growth of the smartphone industry, but it also has a glaring weakness: Qualcomm depends on Apple and Samsung for roughly half of its revenue.
In the past, Qualcomm provided the wireless modem for Apple iPhones, and SoCs and wireless modems for Samsung flagship Galaxy devices. But both companies are now moving to cut Qualcomm silicon out of their handsets. Apple will reportedly use its own wireless modem or an Intel one in a variant of its next iPhone. Samsung replaced Qualcomm Snapdragon processors with its own Exynos SoC in its latest S6 handsets and installed its own Shannon wireless modem. 
Samsung has its own chipmaking business which is also a threat to Qualcomm. Samsung, Apple, and Qualcomm all license mobile chip designs from ARM Holdings. But unlike either company, Samsung has a foundry which accepts manufacturing contracts from other OEMs. Apple, for example, recently contracted Samsung to manufacture its upcoming A9 chips. Meanwhile, the Samsung Exynos processor has found its way into other smartphones from Meizu and ZTE, which both also use Qualcomm chips.

In response, Qualcomm shifted its focus toward emerging markets with ""turnkey"" solutions for smaller OEMs. These package deals let OEMs bundle Qualcomm hardware and software together, which reduces the development and manufacturing costs of new phones. However, the pricing power that came with that strategy was considered anticompetitive in China, which resulted in a $975 million fine last year. That fine caused net income to plunge 46% year-over-year last quarter.
Qualcomm does not expect things to improve anytime soon. It recently slashed its full year revenue and earnings outlook, blaming Apple and Samsung for those adjustments.

The winner: QualcommIt is tough to pick between two losers, but Qualcomm is a safer bad news buy for three reasons.
First, Qualcomm is still profitable. The fine in China took a bite out of its GAAP earnings, but excluding that charge, its non-GAAP net income rose 4% annually last quarter. AMD was not profitable on any basis last quarter. Second, Qualcomm stock is relatively cheap at 14 times earnings, compared to the S&P 500 average price-to-earnings of 21 times and the industry trailing average of 48 times. 
Third, Qualcomm could bounce back if it diversifies its top line away from Apple and Samsung. Moreover, the commoditization of the smartphone market -- which harms those leading players -- is a positive development for Qualcomm, since it means smaller OEMs will require turnkey solutions. AMD, however, does not have an easy way to diversify away from its core businesses. Lastly, Qualcomm pays a respectable 2.9% dividend and has raised it for 11 straight years. There is little chance AMD will ever pay a dividend.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently reported its first quarter earnings, and they were ugly. The PC segment continued to collapse, with revenue from CPUs and GPUs falling by 38% year-over-year. The Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment, which includes AMD's game console business, shrunk as well, with revenue falling by 7% and operating profit nearly cut in half.
AMD doesn't expect things to get better anytime soon. The company has guided for a 3% sequential decline in total revenue during the second quarter, equivalent to a 30% year-over-year decline. The second half of this year may prove to be a bit better for AMD, with new graphics cards expected to launch in June, but big revenue declines are still likely, as are continued losses.
With AMD burning cash as it attempts to turn around its business, how long does the company have before bankruptcy becomes a real possibility?
A painful decline AMD still had about $900 million in cash and investments at the end of the first quarter, and the company has done a good job at maintaining a sizable cash balance despite its poor results. AMD has taken a few steps over the past few years to prevent its cash balance from falling too low. In 2013, the company sold its campus in Austin, Texas and leased it back, raising about $164 million in the process.
AMD has also slashed its capital expenditures, spending just $95 million in 2014 compared to $250 million in 2011. It's difficult to say for sure, but AMD may be underspending on capex in an effort to conserve cash, given that the company's depreciation expense was twice its capital expenditures in 2014. While this helps the situation in the short-term, it's unlikely to be sustainable in the long-run.
Here's how some key balance sheet figures have changed from 2010 to 2014:

AMD has managed to avoid taking on additional debt, and in fact has reduced its debt slightly over the past five years. But the book value of the company has plummeted, and after the first quarter, AMD is on the cusp of having a negative book value.
The balance sheet may not look all that concerning, given the big cash balance and the steady levels of debt, but things have actually gotten quite a bit worse over the past five years. The Altman Z-Score, a number calculated from various items on a company's balance sheet, is a useful way to determine whether a company is at risk of going bankrupt. A Z-Score below 1.81 means that the company is likely headed toward bankruptcy within the next few years.
Here's how AMD's Z-Score has evolved from 2010 to 2014:

In 2010, AMD's Z-Score indicated that it was distressed, but barely so. Since then, the Z-Score has plummeted, turning negative in 2014. The Altman Z-Score is a far from perfect metric, but it does help show that AMD's balance sheet has truly deteriorated over the past five years.
A few years left Despite the bleakness of AMD's balance sheet, the good news is that AMD has until 2019 before it has to repay any significant portion of its outstanding debt, with $600 million worth of notes maturing that year. This buys AMD some time to turn things around before it needs to refinance that debt.
The problem is that the deterioration of AMD's business doesn't seem to be slowing down. First quarter results were awful by any measure, much worse compared to the first quarter of 2014, and the second quarter won't be any better.
Delays are starting to plague the company, not surprising given that research and development spending has been slashed continually over the past few years. AMD's 64-bit ARM server chips, supposed to be the savior of AMD's languishing server business, have been pushed back to the second half of this year, one year later than initially planned. Meanwhile, AMD's upcoming discrete graphics cards are now expected sometime in June. Competitor NVIDIA has had the high-end of the market essentially to itself since last September when it launched the GTX 970 and 980, and AMD has yet to respond with anything at all.
There's no real threat that AMD goes bankrupt in the next few years -- the company has plenty of cash remaining and no major debt repayments coming up. But that cash balance will continue to dwindle as AMD tries to remain competitive in too many markets with too few resources, battling Intel and NVIDIA simultaneously. By the time 2019 rolls around, AMD's financial position will likely be even more precarious than it is today. If the company hasn't come up with some sort of strategy to return to profitability by then, bankruptcy will become very likely, if not inevitable.

            ","Following struggling chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) weak earnings and forward guidance, Barron's reported that Jeffries analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated the stock as a ""Buy"" and maintained his $4 price target, representing a nearly 40% upside from current levels.
Lipacis argued that AMD has ""great [intellectual property],"" citing x86, ARM, graphics, and server-fabric technologies as examples of such ""great"" intellectual property. He also reportedly says that AMD just needs a ""plan to monetize it.""
To be perfectly blunt, I disagree on the value of this IP. Here is why.
If the IP is so valuable, why are AMD products losing market share? The simple question that investors should ask about this allegedly ""valuable IP"": If the IP is so valuable, why do AMD products continue to lose market share?
It is well-known that AMD x86 processors are simply outclassed by the competition. Intel processors are known to offer both higher performance and more power efficiency than comparable AMD offerings. This is likely one of the main reasons that Intel keeps on taking substantial market share from AMD in x86 processors.
In graphics processors, it is the same old story -- NVIDIA products deliver better performance-per-watt than their AMD counterparts, which has helped the former gain significant market share, particularly in gaming notebooks.
AMD is still developing products based on its internally designed ARM core, so it is hard to make any assessment of the relative worth of this particular piece of intellectual property.
Finally, the same question needs to be asked about AMD server fabric technology: if it is so great, why isn't AMD out making money with it? I believe the fabric in question actually came to AMD as part of its acquisition of SeaMicro -- you know, the acquisition that AMD just took a writedown on and shuttered.
Another reason AMD IP might not be worth all that much The big growth markets for CPUs and graphics -- the IP that some assert is so valuable -- are the low-power and mobile markets as well as the networking and server markets.
In mobile, ARM has a whole suite of CPUs, graphics cores, and video processors. This IP is also quite good, which is why it is so broadly adopted.
Imagination also licenses CPU cores (MIPS) and graphics/media (PowerVR). Its graphics IP is also known to be top-notch -- the company reports that it is seeing ""record royalties"" for its MIPS CPU cores, implying that this IP is competitive. 
It is just hard to see a lot of value in the AMD IP portfolio given how rich the current semiconductor intellectual property landscape is. 
The best way for AMD to ""monetize"" its IP I do not think that IP makes AMD valuable enough as an acquisition target given that good IP can be licensed for cheap. The best way for AMD to ""monetize"" this portfolio is to make competitive chips based on said IP.
The fact that AMD is losing market share in both PC processors and graphics, and has essentially no presence in servers, tells me everything I need to know about the true value of its current IP portfolio.

            ","Back in February 2012, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announced that it would acquire microserver vendor SeaMicro to ""accelerate"" its ""disruptive server strategy."" The company paid a whopping $334 million for the company, with $281 million of that paid in cash.
Just three years later, AMD announced during its first quarter 2015 report that it would be pulling the proverbial plug on this venture and taking a $75 million writedown in the process. On the most recent earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su said that the micro-server market ""[has] not developed at the pace we might have thought a couple of years ago.""
Su also pointed out that AMD's ""core competency is really in processors and being able to service that business through either standard or semicustom products."" In other words, AMD -- a chip vendor -- thinks that it should just stick to selling chips.
What a terrible waste Perhaps the most frustrating part of this for AMD shareholders must be the fact that AMD paid $281 million in cold hard cash for this acquisition. It would be one thing if AMD were generating robust levels of cash year-in and year-out, but as you can see from the table below, AMD's cash flow situation since early 2012 has been pretty bad:

Source: YCharts
The worst part of this is that AMD has over $2 billion in debt to service, but only a little over $900 million in cash on hand. The company would have been better served plowing that $281 million in cash into paying off some of its relatively high interest debt.
Speaking of servers ... AMD's server processor share has plunged so much in recent years that it's a stretch to say that the company is even ""competing"" in this market right now. Aside from a few rebranded PC processors, as well as an ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH)based server chip that has perpetually been stuck in the ""sampling"" phase (to be fair, Su says that this chip -- known as Seattle -- should generate revenue in the second half of this year), AMD hasn't released new chips aimed at the server market in years.
AMD CEO Lisa Su talked about how the company is investing in developing new server chips in a bid to regain share, but I'm very skeptical that the company can even succeed at this point. AMD's larger rival, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), has said that it spends $2 billion per year in data center related research and development.
That's more than twice AMD's yearly research and development budget.
In addition, Intel has a strong base of products, architectures, and customer relationships from which to build off of; AMD not only needs to use its much smaller research and development budget to make up for lost time, but it then needs to be able to consistently invest so that its products remain competitive year in, year out.
This doesn't seem realistic to me.
It'll be interesting to see what AMD has to say in May AMD made sure to let investors know that it will be hosting a financial analyst day on May 6. I am very interested to see what AMD's long-term strategy with respect to the server market. In particular, I'm interested in seeing what particular segments of the overall server market AMD will focus on, and what sort of financials the company expects in the medium and long term.

            ","Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
What: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were down 14.1% as of 10:48 a.m. Friday after the company announced disappointing first-quarter results.
So what: Quarterly revenue fell 26% year over year to $1.03 billion, which translated to an adjusted net loss of $73 million, or $0.09 per share. Analysts, on average, were looking for a much narrower loss of $0.05 per share on higher revenue of $1.05 billion.
Even so, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said: ""Building great products, driving deeper customer relationships and simplifying our business remain the right long-term steps to strengthen AMD and improve our financial performance.""
Now what: For now, Su elaborated, that means focusing ""on improving our near-term financial results and delivering a stronger second half of the year based on completing our work to rebalance channel inventories and shipping strong new products.""
For the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to decrease 3% sequentially, plus or minus 3% -- or a range of roughly $0.97 billion to $1.03 billion. Analysts were modeling sequential quarterly growth in revenue of 9.7% to $1.13 billion.
In the end, it's hard to blame the market for bidding shares of AMD down today given both its modest quarterly miss and lighter-than-expected guidance. Until AMD can show some tangible progress toward achieving its goal of sustained profitability -- which starts with improved financial results in the second half of the year -- I fear long investors will likely endure more pain going forward.

            ","Fellow Fool Leo Sun recently published a write-up discussing why chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is not actively targeting the market for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chromebooks. Leo pointed to a quote from an AMD executive, who reportedly said that Chromebooks are a ""rock-bottom market"" with unattractive margins.
This might be true for AMD, but in my view, it has very little to do with anything inherent to the Chromebook market itself. AMD's apparent inability to compete for good margins in the Chromebook market seems to be a company-specific problem. Allow me to explain.
Intel is making bank from Chromebooks at good margins Over the past several years, AMD's gross profit margins have plunged. In the last 12 months, the gross profit margin percentage came out to just 33.4%, down from the low 40% range the company had enjoyed in years past. This performance stands in stark contrast to rival Intel(NASDAQ:INTC), which has seen gross profit margins of over 63% during the same period. 
Although one could rightfully attribute those very high gross profit margins to its data-center chips, note that last year, the Intel PC Client Group recorded an operating margin of over 42%. That means gross profit margins for that division, since Intel spends heavily on research and development, were significantly above that level.
Yet Intel sells lots of chips into Chromebooks and Chromebook-class laptops.
Low-cost does not always mean low-margin There is a fundamental concept that investors need to understand: Low prices do not necessarily mean low margins. The gross profit margin percentage does not just depend on the selling prices of its products but the costs to manufacture those products as well.
For example, if I sell a chip for $1.00, but it costs me just $0.30 to manufacture it, then my gross profit margin percentage on that chip is a very respectable 70%. Conversely, if I sell a chip for $1,000, but it costs me $750 to manufacture it, then my gross profit margin percentage on that chip is just 25%.
Where I think the confusion comes from is that low-cost chips, even with high per-chip gross profit margin percentages, do not generate as much in gross profit dollars per unit. However, that is why it is always important to factor volume into the equation to get a picture of the total gross profit.
With that out of the way, let's get back to AMD, Intel, and Chromebooks.
Intel margins on Chromebooks are quite high The chips that Intel typically sells into Chromebooks are either very feature-reduced Core processors sold under the ""Pentium"" and ""Celeron"" brands, or they are Atom-derived chips sold under those same brands.
Now, Intel has said that the majority of its Pentium and Celeron chips have been moved to the Atom architecture, because this lowers the company cost structure for said chips. Furthermore, Intel has indicated that over 20% of all of the chips it sells into laptop PCs are based on the Atom architecture.
So why is Intel able to make good money selling low-cost PC chips? 
It is about cost structure, and potentially competitiveness I believe the real reason AMD does not want to take Intel on in devices such as Chromebooks is that it simply does not have the cost structure to compete. Intel just announced that it is shipping low-cost, low-power chips known as Braswell for the low-cost PC market based on its 14-nanometer technology.
AMD's Carrizo-L, which is expected to compete with Braswell, is also expected to ship in the first half of 2015. However, there are a couple of things worth noting. Not only does AMD need to pay an external chip manufacturer to build its products (putting it at a disadvantage to Intel right off the bat), but AMD's chips also do not seem to target the same power envelope.
For some context, Carrizo-L, according to the AMD website, is targeted at a 10 to 25-watt power envelope. Braswell, on the other hand, targets a 6-watt ""thermal design power"" and a 4-watt ""scenario design power."" These chips are not even close to the same league in terms of power consumption.
That means low-cost Braswell chips can be used to power cheap, fanless Chromebooks. I am not convinced that the current AMD product lineup is well suited to address this opportunity.

            ","AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) cheap x86 microprocessors seem like a natural match for Chromebooks, the low-end laptops tethered to Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cloud-based ecosystem. 
Yet AMD isn't interested in developing chips for Chromebooks, according to CTO Mark Papermaster, who called Chromebooks a ""rock-bottom"" market at the ISSCC conference in February. Is shunning Chromebooks that the right strategy for AMD, or is it missing out on a lucrative growth market?

Chromebooks. Source: Google
The business of ChromebooksIDC estimates that Global sales of Chromebooks roughly doubled to 4.6 million shipments in 2014, but only accounted for 1.5% of the PC market.
However, Gartner believes that annual Chromebook sales will soar to 14.2 million units by 2017, accounting for 4.3% of the PC market. By comparison, Gartner expects annual shipments of all PCs, including Chromebooks, to only rise 4.3% to 327.3 million units between 2014 and 2017. Based on those numbers, establishing a toehold in Chromebooks might help AMD offset sluggish PC sales.
Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Celeron chips power roughly three-fourths of all Chromebooks, according to Mercury Research analyst Dean McCarron. The remainder runs on ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) licensed designs. This duopoly means that AMD would need to undercut both Intel and ARM licensees to enter the Chromebook market -- which could be rough on margins.
Are AMD's chips too powerful?The problem with Chromebooks is that they're designed for light usage, such as Web browsing, office work, and video streaming. These tasks don't require a lot of graphical horsepower.
AMD, which acquired graphics card maker ATI in 2006, specializes in APUs which combine the CPU's processing power with the GPU's graphical muscle. Carrizo, its upcoming notebook SoC, pairs four x86 CPU cores with eight GPU cores -- which is arguably more power than any Chrome OS user would ever need. 
Yet AMD's Mullins, the low-power APU that it introduced last year, seems like a good fit for Chromebooks. The chip, originally intended for tablets, was installed in cheap Windows laptops like Hewlett-Packard's $230 Stream 14 last year.
Why margins matterIt seems odd that AMD didn't pit Mullins against the Celeron in the Chromebook market, but the margins, as Papermaster suggested, probably aren't worth the effort.
AMD is still on the path set by former CEO Rory Read, who shifted the company toward higher-margin businesses, like the embedded, server, and semicustom unit, which sells SoCs for Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. That strategy helped AMD grow its top line, reduce operating expenses, and narrow its non-GAAP losses.
Part of that strategy, which current CEO Lisa Su is continuing, is to avoid head-on battles against Intel. Intel has much more cash to spend on marketing, and isn't shy about taking losses to gain or retain market share. For example, Intel's mobile unit posted an operating loss of $4.2 billion due to its aggressive subsidization of tablet and smartphone makers. With Chromebooks, Intel sells low-margin Celerons to prevent ARM licensees from gaining ground in the PC market.
Will the Chromebook Pixel change AMD's mind?Chromebooks don't require much GPU power, but future models might. Last month, Google unveiled the second-generation Chromebook Pixel, a high-end Chromebook that starts at $999. The device sports a 2.6 Ghz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. For graphics, the Pixel uses Intel HD Graphics 5500, an integrated graphics card which can play most modern PC games on low graphics settings.

The new Chromebook Pixel. Source: Google
There's not much of a market now for the Pixel, since Chrome apps don't demand much CPU or GPU performance. However, Google is making select Android apps compatible with Chrome OS, which means that graphically demanding Android games could be natively played on Chromebooks soon. That cross-platform compatibility might encourage other OEMs to manufacture high-end Chromebooks with beefier GPUs, which would be a more favorable market for Carrizo.
The bottom lineAMD's distaste for the Chromebook market makes sense, because it doesn't want to ruin its margins competing against Intel and ARM in a ""rock bottom"" market. But if the Chromebook market continues growing and evolves toward higher-end devices like the Pixel, an opportunity for APUs like Carrizo might emerge.

            ","The tech industry has seen some of the most significant and largest acquisitions in corporate history.
Below are five of the biggest -- in some cases in terms of dollars spent, in others, in terms of their significance. Whether it was a larger firm absorbing a start-up that later defined its business, or a tech giant absorbing an established rival, these acquisitions have all helped to define the current tech landscape.
Google buys AndroidGoogle (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has made many prescient acquisitions over the years -- YouTube in 2006, Applied Semantics in 2003 -- but its acquisition of Android may have been the most significant. When Google purchased Android back in 2005, few people had ever heard of Andy Rubin's start-up. In terms of a raw dollar figure, the deal was rather insignificant (an estimated $50 million), but the resulting effects have been so notable (a Google executive later termed it ""its best deal ever"") that the purchase deserves its place on this list.
Today, Android is one of the largest operating systems in the world, with around 1 billion active users, and a dominant share of the mobile market -- the overwhelming majority of smartphones and tablets sold worldwide run Google's operating system.
Google doesn't profit from Android directly (it gives it away for free) but Android serves as a tapestry for Google's services, allowing it to push its products like Maps, search, and Gmail onto its many mobile users.
Apple acquires Steve Jobs' NeXTLike Google's purchase of Android, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquisition of NeXT in late 1996 wasn't the largest in terms of dollars -- it cost just $400 million. But if it hadn't happened, Apple probably wouldn't be in business today, let alone be the world's largest company.
The purchase of NeXT brought Steve Jobs back to Apple, and set the stage for the company's resurgence. Technologies developed at NeXT form the backbone of what are arguably Apple's two most important products: its operating systems. Both OS X (Mac) and iOS (iPhone, iPad) were built on technologies developed at NeXT, and Apple's exclusive use of these operating systems sets its products apart from competitors.
AMD gets into graphics with ATIBoth Android and NeXT are, in hindsight, wildly successful acquisitions. The success of semiconductor giant AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) 2006 purchase of graphics maker ATI, however, is a bit less clear.
For $5.4 billion, AMD entered the graphics market, buying what was then one of the top dedicated graphics card designers. At the time, AMD was coming off one of its most successful quarters ever (in terms of processor market share) and executives argued that the combination would allow the company to take even market share from Intel, as it could court PC OEMs with a combination of AMD processors and ATI graphics chips.
It's not clear if the merger was a significant contributor, but AMD's business has definitely gone downhill since acquisition, and its current market cap (about $2 billion) is less than half of what it paid for ATI. In the graphics card market, Nvidia has surged ahead of AMD, while Intel completely dominates the PC processor market.
Hewlett-Packard merges with CompaqHewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) $25 billion purchase of rival PC-maker Compaq is, like AMD's purchase of ATI, fairly controversial.
The purchase did create a PC behemoth -- Hewlett-Packard is, to this day, one of the largest PC vendors in the world. But it may have tarnished Hewlett-Packard's culture and focus. Shareholders have certainly suffered. Since it announced the acquisition in September, 2001, Hewlett-Packard shares are up around 103% on a total return basis. The S&P 500, however, is up more than 138%.

^SPXTR data by YCharts
To be fair, other tech behemoths -- including both Microsoft and IBM -- have done even worse for their shareholders (returning about 102% and 91%, respectively) but Hewlett-Packard has largely wallowed in mediocrity since the acquisition, going through a string of CEOs and several failed attempts at transformation -- a sharp contrast to its massive success in the 1990s.
The merger is even more interesting considering the fact that it was opposed by board member Walter Hewlett, son of Bill Hewlett, the co-founder of the company. Hewlett led a proxy battle in an attempt to block the merger, but was ultimately unsuccessful.
AOL buys Time WarnerThe merger of AOL (NYSE:AOL) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) was one of the largest in history. In total, AOL spent about $162 billion to acquire the media giant, creating a corporate colossus that was supposed to -- at least in theory -- dominate the Internet. With Time Warner's networks and cable assets, and AOL's Internet service, the mashup appeared to hold great potential. The combined company may have been able to dictate the flow of media and advertising in the United States.
Unfortunately, it is widely regarded as a disaster. In 2009, it came to an end, with Time Warner spinning AOL off. It also divested its cable company (Time Warner Cable) and later, its magazine publishing arm, Time, Inc. Although the share price of all the firms has rallied since the split, the market cap of all four firms combined (around $120 billion) remains a far cry from AOL-Time Warner's once enormous $350 billion valuation.

            ","Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) must ""face claims that it committed securities fraud"" in ""hiding problems"" with the launch of a chip code-named Llano, according to Reuters. 
AMD reportedly told investors it would deliver ample supply of Llano chips beginning in the second quarter of 2011. The reality, according to Reuters, was that the company faced supply constraints. To make matters worse, by the time AMD worked through its production issues, demand for those chips had dried up. This is a fast-moving sector, after all.
Then, in an earnings warning in October 2012, AMD said it would take a writedown on $100 million worth of Llano inventory that it simply couldn't move. Reuters reported that, as a result of this alleged deception, the plaintiffs seek damages for investors who purchased AMD stock ""between April 2011 and October 2012.""
The huge fall in AMD's share price According to Reuters, the plaintiffs allege that AMD's stock fell by 74% from March 2012 to October 2012 due to the market learning about the severity of the Llano supply situation.
While the $100 million inventory writedown unquestionably cost shareholders, I'm not at all convinced the stock-price drop from $8.35 to $2.18 had much, if anything, to do with the Llano situation.
Let's dig a little bit deeper, shall we?
AMD in 2012 Here's a chart of AMD's stock price during 2012:

Source: Google Finance.
Notice how things were going pretty well until the shares started sliding around late March/early April? Well, during this time, AMD likely didn't face supply constraints on Llano, and by April 2012 it had even begun shipping Llano's follow-on, known as Trinity.
In my view, the biggest problem facing the company in 2012 was a weakening PC market: Both AMD and larger rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported declines in their respective PC-related revenue for the year.
In July 2012, AMD pre-announced that revenue for the second quarter of the year would be down 11% sequentially. The previous forecast had been for a 3% decline.
Then, when AMD finally reported results for the second quarter, the company said it expected revenue to ""decrease 1% sequentially +/- 3%."" That was not so great (the second half of the year is supposed to be seasonally up), but things got worse when AMD negatively pre-announced again.
During that pre-announcement, AMD said revenue would drop 10% sequentially, instead of just 1%. The chipmaker also said it would take the $100 million inventory writedown related to the Llano chips.
The writedown wasn't why AMD stock plunged Whether AMD shaded the truth regarding the Llano supply situation or not, I think, has little to do with the painful share price decline in 2012. AMD's shares had already taken a beating well before management announced the writedown.
I believe the share price declines both before the writedown and after were due to a much weaker than expected PC market, coupled with very aggressive competition from Intel as it fought to stabilize its own PC chip shipments in a tough market.
Finally, for a more visual illustration of why the inventory writedown was hardly a major driver of AMD's stock loss, look at the following chart:

Source: Google Finance.
Intel, which derives most of its revenue and profits from PC chip sales, experienced a very similar trend in its share price during 2012. Now, the decline wasn't as steep (AMD is a far more volatile stock, and that volatility cuts both ways) but the directions were roughly the same.

            ","A little while ago, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) made it clear to the industry that it wanted to monetize its graphics patent war chest. This has led some to suggest that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), the other major vendor of high-performance standalone graphics, could potentially follow suit.
Indeed, on Twitter, Justin Jaynes made a very interesting point in response to my claim that Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) could simply poach graphics talent rather than buy the entire company -- he said that while Samsung could poach engineers, it cannot poach patents.
To that end, I decided to do some digging to try to get a sense of the relative value of AMD's graphics patent portfolio relative to that of other players in the industry.
Here is what NVIDIA says At an investor presentation this year, NVIDIA shared the following slide:

Source: NVIDIA
NVIDIA claims that it has over 600 ""fundamental graphics patents"" while its peers tend to have far fewer. Interestingly enough, it appears that if Samsung were to acquire AMD (as some have suggested), this would approximately double its ""fundamental graphics patent"" portfolio. Still smaller than NVIDIA, but this might, as has been suggested, help it better defend against NVIDIA's patent lawsuit.
What would Samsung have to pay if it wanted those patents? If Samsung were to outright buy AMD today for, say, a 50% premium to the current market capitalization, this would imply a purchase price of $3 billion. After factoring in the net debt position, Samsung would wind up paying a tad over $4 billion.
In that case, would it make financial sense for Samsung to pick up AMD just for its graphics patents?
Licensing NVIDIA patents might be cheaper You might recall that Intel wound up paying NVIDIA $1.5 billion over the course of six years as part of what is essentially a cross-licensing agreement (to read more about the Intel-NVIDIA deal, I recommend checking out the AnandTech article here).
At any rate, the deal between NVIDIA and Intel seemed to essentially boil down to Intel needing access to NVIDIA graphics patents in order to continue to build its own graphics processors into its PC chips.
My guess is that if Samsung has to, it could simply license NVIDIA's patent portfolio for significantly less than it would need to pay to buy AMD. Intel is paying NVIDIA $264 million per year in a deal worth $1.5 billion. Even if Samsung had to pay NVIDIA the same annual rate, it makes sense to just license the patents.
It will be interesting to see how the NVIDIA-Samsung situation plays out This whole discussion has come about because NVIDIA recently sued Samsung, claiming that the chips Samsung includes in its phones (which usually have Qualcomm or ARM designed graphics processors) infringe upon NVIDIA's fundamental patents.
As per the slide above, NVIDIA says the ITC hearing with respect to this case will happen in late June and that a decision is set to come in early October. I am very interested to see how this all plays out and what NVIDIA's patent portfolio is deemed to be ""worth."" Not only is this interesting to NVIDIA shareholders, it could help establish the value of AMD's graphics-related patent portfolio as well.

            ","Over on Twitter, I came across the following ""tweet"": 
If anyone buys AMD it should be Apple not Samsung.
This sparked quite an interesting discussion between a lot of smart people, some of whom thought that an acquisition of AMD(NASDAQ:AMD) by Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL) would be a great idea, others not so much. 
I am firmly in the camp that believes Apple would get very little from acquiring AMD. Here is why. 
Not much AMD has to offer that Apple does not already haveAMD's main assets are its CPU core development teams, its graphics processor teams, and its system-on-chip integration teams, and I do not think that Apple really needs the full teams from AMD as it has organic efforts here. 
If that sounds familiar, that is because it is a very similar argument for why I believe Samsung will not acquire AMD. 
As far as CPUs go, Apple is all set. Its low-power CPU cores offer best-in-class performance -- Apple is ahead of Samsung here, actually, as the latter still uses stock ARM cores, and the company seems to be able to poach talent from any company that it would like. 
As far as graphics processors go, Apple has seemingly been hiring graphics talent for quite some time. If Apple really wanted to bring best-in-class graphics IP in-house quickly (rather than try to build it organically as it seems to be doing now), then the company could just buy Imagination Technologies for a fraction of what it would pay for AMD once its debt is factored into the equation. 
Finally, just as Samsung has its own system-on-chip integration teams, so does Apple, and they seem to do a solid job. I do not think having the integration teams in-house would be something Apple would be interested in. 
Does Apple want to sell PC chips and graphics processors?If Apple were to buy AMD, it would necessarily inherit all current business units and projects. AMD builds standalone graphics processors for notebooks and desktops, PC chips that it sells to PC vendors, and it is even working on a number of projects in embedded, servers, and semi-custom. 
I do not believe Apple wants to be in the business of selling chips into all of these markets. While some might argue that Apple could use AMD processors to power its Macs, keep in mind that its PC chips are currently not competitive. Apple would likely need to invest significantly in the acquired AMD asset to bulk up the performance of future AMD products just to make them usable in the Macs. 
And, even then, there is still no guarantee that these chips would wind up competitive enough to boot Intel. 
An Apple buyout of AMD seems like a pipe-dream The idea that Apple will buy AMD seems highly implausible, just like the rumored buyout of AMD by Samsung. I disagree with the author of the tweet mentioned above and think that an Apple/AMD hookup makes even less sense than a Samsung/AMD hookup. 
Samsung, at the very least, would be more likely to try to make AMD's PC processor business viable since it has expressed interest in selling its Exynos processors to other phone/tablet vendors.
Apple, on the other hand, designs chips for its own use -- it is not a merchant chip company nor does it have any ambitions to be one. Picking up a company like AMD just to service its internal chip needs, particularly when Apple already has strong in-house capabilities that it can continue to build organically, just does not make sense.

            ","There has been quite a lot of talk these days about Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) potentially acquiring struggling chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Although such a deal might make sense on the surface, the case for it weakens significantly upon deeper analysis.
The potential rationale for this dealAMD is not all that well, and the company has struggled to generate positive free cash flow for two years. This is not surprising given that its market share in both PC processors as well as stand-alone graphics processors both continue to weaken.
A significant part of the problem looks to be, as has been widely noted at this point, that as AMD revenues weaken, the company has had to cut research and development spending in order to stay afloat. As it does this, its product pipeline also weakens, making it more difficult to compete in future product cycles. This leads to a vicious cycle of even more research and development cuts.
On the other hand, Samsung is flush with cash and generates substantial cash flow year-in and year-out. The popular idea, then, is that Samsung could acquire AMD and give it the necessary funding to be more competitive in its end markets. This, according to some, could potentially lead to revenue growth for AMD and a solid return for Samsung on the acquisition.
Does AMD really bring much to the table?  The first problem with such a deal is that AMD does not offer much to Samsung that it cannot build organically (or acquire more cheaply). AMD's core assets, in my view, are its CPU cores and development teams, its graphics cores and development teams, and its system-on-chip integration teams.
Samsung has already said that it is designing its own CPU cores, and if it wants AMD's talent, it can simply poach it (as it and many other companies have already done). The same argument applies to graphics processors. Samsung also very clearly has its own system-on-chip integration teams, so there is not much value-add for Samsung there, either.
What about x86? A point that AMD bulls will make is that AMD has an x86 license, which allows it to compete in the Windows PC market. This is true, but Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a very established player in the PC processor market, and my view is that its PC-related product pipeline is much stronger than AMD's by virtue of the substantial research and development investments that it has made there.
Now, AMD bulls will say that with Samsung's support, the company could bulk up its x86 processor portfolio and make it a viable competitor in PCs and even servers. That sounds nice in theory, but I think that in order to give the AMD product portfolio a fighting chance, it would need to substantially increase its investments.
Even if Samsung were to bring its investments in x86 chips up to the level of what Intel spends, it would take time for those improvements to actually show up in products.
Then, even if Samsung could significantly improve AMD's x86 design pipeline, it seems unlikely that it would be able to compensate for the manufacturing disadvantage that Samsung has relative to Intel.
Being a fab is a better idea Although Samsung does design its own processors for its own use, it has made it clear that it wants to attract a broad range of foundry customers. Why should it buy AMD and spend lots of money and effort trying to compete with Intel in PCs, when it could profit from building chips for a lot of semiconductor companies?
Between building out its foundry business and building its own Exynos chips for mobile devices, it is hard to see a situation where Samsung wins big with an AMD acquisition. And frankly, if Samsung were interested in AMD, I think it would have acquired it already.

The technology industry has done quite well lately, carrying the Nasdaq Composite back up to the 5,000 mark for the first time since the turn of the millennium. Yet even though many tech stocks have performed well lately, some are facing major challenges that might make some investors reluctant to commit their hard-earned capital.
In order to pinpoint a couple of troubling tech stocks and a solid alternative to recommend, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to give their thoughts on some well-known companies in the technology sector. Look at what they have to say and see what you think about both their bullish and bearish views on these companies.
Tim Green (Advanced Micro Devices): It may seem tempting to buy shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in the hopes of a turnaround, but it's one stock that I'd stay away from. The company's core PC business, which includes PC processors and graphics cards, has been unraveling for the past few years, and its attempts to diversify away from the PC has spread the company's limited resources too thin.
Source: AMD.
Despite high-profile new product launches in recent years, AMD has been bleeding market share to both Intel in the CPU market and NVIDIA in the GPU market. A few years ago, AMD shipped about 40% of all discrete graphics cards; today, this percentage has fallen to just 24% as NVIDIA has consolidated its lead. AMD plans to launch new graphics cards later this year, but the most recent refresh of its product line didn't help in terms of market share at all.
AMD has managed to stay afloat thanks to its deals to provide the processors for the major game consoles, and the company is actively trying to strike additional semi-custom design deals. But any profits from this segment have been largely wiped out by losses in the PC segment and significant interest payments on the company's debt. With any future semi-custom deals unlikely to be anywhere near as big as the game console deals, meaningfully growing the segment will be difficult.
AMD is a company that's trying to compete in too many markets: PC CPUs, GPUs, server CPUs, semi-custom CPUs, and embedded CPUs. Intel spends more than ten times as much on research and development compared to AMD, and even NVIDIA now outspends the company on that front. AMD needs to narrow its focus, and until that happens I can't recommend the stock.
Dan Caplinger (Nokia): One stock I would avoid currently is Nokia (NYSE:NOK), which is only a shell of itself after having sold off its mobile device and services division to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year. It's true that the sale helped Nokia rid itself of what had become an unsuccessful business, as the mobile phone pioneer had failed to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation in the sector and was under threat from more aggressive smartphone makers around the world. What's left is a trio of businesses, with its networking products producing the bulk of Nokia's remaining revenue.
The big issue facing Nokia is whether it can successfully make the transition in an increasingly competitive networking environment. Opportunities abound for growth, especially in the lucrative U.S. market. But the possibility of a dividend cut looms large over Nokia, and even with the stock at relatively reasonable valuations, any reduction in its dividend payout could send the share price tumbling. Nokia will need to demonstrate its ability to tap into important trends like the 5G upgrade cycle while keeping its margins as high as possible. In the long run, Nokia could very well end up on top, but right now, I'd prefer to see how the competition lines up before making bets on the sector.
Bob Ciura (Microsoft): Microsoft is a tech stock investors should buy, because it provides a great combination of growth, value, and dividends, meaning the stock has something to offer virtually all investor types.
Microsoft's two core operating segments, commercial and consumer, both grew revenue last quarter. Devices and consumer revenue grew 8% to $12.9 billion due to several factors. Microsoft sold 10.5 million Lumia units last quarter, leading to $2.3 billion in phone hardware revenue. Surface revenue grew 24%, driven by the success of the Surface Pro 3. Office 365 Home and Personal subscribers jumped 30% to over 9.2 million. Even Bing contributed positively as search advertising revenue rose 23%.
Microsoft's other big business is doing well too. Commercial revenue increased 5% to $13.3 billion thanks squarely to Microsoft's booming enterprise cloud business. Commercial cloud revenue soared 114%, thanks to Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online, and eclipsed a $5.5 billion annualized revenue run-rate. And revenue from server products and services grew 9%.
In all, Microsoft generated $9.9 billion of free cash flow in the first half of its current fiscal year. It paid $4.8 billion of dividends in the same period, which equates to a very comfortable 48% payout ratio. All this cash is piling up on the balance sheet. At the end of last quarter, the company held $90 billion in cash and marketable securities on the books with just a 20% long-term debt to equity ratio.
Microsoft produces huge free cash flow, returns a sizable chunk of it to investors through its 3% dividend, and trades for just 16 times earnings. For all these qualities, Microsoft is a buy.

In previous articles, I highlighted strengths and weaknesses for the company. Today, I want to take a look at five recent statements from the management team and what they could mean for shareholders.
1. It expects the PC business to grow againDuring the fourth quarter earnings call, CEO Lisa Su stated that the PC market will stabilize with low single-digit percentage declines in 2015. Su claimed AMD had ""right-sized"" its investments in the space and had reduced its downstream channel inventory in the fourth quarter.
Su stated, ""We will continue these corrective actions into the first quarter to aim for a return to growth starting in the second quarter."" According to Su, that growth can be accomplished by a reduction in inventory and the upcoming launch of its Carrizo SoCs,
However, investors should recall that revenue at the Computing and Graphics segment slipped 16% year-over-year in 2014, primarily due to lower desktop processor and chipset sales. Meanwhile, Carrizo SoCs are still 28 nanometer chips, which could have trouble competing against fanless Intel 14 nanometer Broadwell chips in ultra-thin notebooks and 2-in-1 devices.
2. Consoles matter more than PCsSu also stated that AMD will increase its R&D investments in the EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) business, which generated 43% of revenue last year.
Annual EESC revenue and operating income rose 51% and 35%, respectively, thanks to robust sales of the Sony PS4 and Microsoft Xbox One, which both run on AMD SoCs. According to Su:
Nearly 30 million Sony and Microsoft consoles have now shipped. Our semi-custom shipments more than doubled in 2014, which fueled excellent full-year performance for this part of our business.
3. Supporting ARM-based serversSince AMD has been marginalized by Intel in servers, it is boosting support for ARM-licensed designs in the EESC business. In regards to supporting ARM's interest in servers, Su stated:
Our work to lead the industry's transition to 64-bit ARM also gained momentum in the quarter. We have secured multiple design wins for our upcoming Opteron A series, and the first systems are expected to launch later this year.
For AMD, the 64-bit Opteron A1100, unveiled last January, is its first ARM-based CPU. The chip is specifically designed for microservers -- a new class of small, low-powered servers which are designated single tasks. 
When companies purchase microservers in clusters, they only purchase the computing power they need. By comparison, a company that purchases a powerful Xeon-powered server might overpay for unused computing power. IDC expects microservers to account for over 10% of the server market by 2016, which could bode well for Opteron-powered microservers.
4. Opportunities for growth in GPUsAMD has been aggressively trying to undercut NVIDIA in high-end graphics cards for years. However, investors should remember that most of the GPU market is comprised of integrated graphics chips like AMD APUs, Intel HD Graphics, and NVIDIA Project Denver.
Within this market, Intel is the clear market leader, with 71.4% of the market, while NVIDIA and AMD control 15% and 13.6%, respectively, according to research firm JPR. But for Su, AMD made progress in this market during the fourth quarter of 2014:
Mobile APU unit shipments, ASPs, and revenue all increased sequentially as our higher-end A8 and A10 APU shipments increased. We also achieved strong double-digit percentage revenue growth for notebook GPUs in the quarter as strategic wins like Apple's iMac with retina 5K display began to ramp.
This split between high-end and low-end GPUs was apparent in the fourth quarter earnings report, which stated that the prices of its GPUs rose sequentially because of higher desktop and notebook GPU average selling prices (ASP) but still declined year-over-year because of a lower channel ASP.
5. A $2 billion market opportunityInvestors should also remember that embedded devices powered by x86 and ARM processors -- which still account for a small part of EESC revenues -- could become more important to the top line. AMD embedded chips are currently used in a wide range of non-PC applications, such as industrial control, automation, and digital gaming.
Speaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in early March, SVP and CFO Devinder Kumar said, ""The available market in that area is about $9 billion. Our target market is $2 billion."" Although Kumar was vague, it means AMD could further distance itself from Intel and NVIDIA and wander into Freescale Semiconductor and Texas Instruments territory instead.
The key takeawaysIn a nutshell, AMD plans to reduce its exposure to consumer PCs, expand its EESC business, and realign its channel sales accordingly. While that sounds like a solid game plan, investors should recall that losses at its troubled Computing and Graphics division wiped out all bottom-line gains at its EESC business last year. If that keeps happening throughout 2015, I would not bet on AMD fixing itself anytime soon.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have fallen 20% over the past 12 months, as shares of top rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) respectively rose 36% and 24%. In previous articles, I discussed AMD's strengths and weaknesses. Today, we'll weigh them against each other to see if AMD is worth buying.

What AMD's valuations tell usSince AMD isn't profitable, it doesn't have a trailing P/E to compare against Intel and Nvidia. However, AMD is valued at 33 times forward earnings, assuming it can earn $0.09 per share in profit (as forecast by Thomson Reuters) by the end of 2016. By comparison, Intel and Nvidia respectively trade at 13 and 17 times forward earnings.
Over the past few years, former CEO Rory Read reduced AMD's operating expenses, maintained the company's cash at a constant level near $1 billion, and made sure no new debt comes due until 2019. Yet that thrifty strategy, combined with AMD's negative free cash flow of $193 million over the past 12 months, makes it tough for the company to mount any effective marketing blitzes against Intel and NVIDIA.
Potential catalystsAMD's greatest asset is its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment, which accounted for 43% of its top line last year. The business's revenue and operating income respectively rose 51% and 35% year over year in 2014, thanks to robust demand for Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4, which are both powered by AMD system on chips, or SoCs.
To date, 11.5 million Xbox Ones and 19.4 million PS4s have been sold, according to market tracking site VGChartz. Considering that Microsoft and Sony both previously sold about 85 million Xbox 360s and PS3s, AMD's console SoCs could keep contributing to its top line for years to come. Nintendo's next console will reportedly use an AMD SoC as well.

The segment also houses AMD's Opteron processors, which are used to power ""microservers."" Microservers are smaller, cheaper, and less powerful servers that usually only perform a single function, such as loading the background images on a webpage. Smaller companies prefer buying microservers in clusters, because it allows them to only buy the processing power they need. By comparison, big traditional servers -- powered mainly by Intel's Xeon processors -- are expensive ""jacks of all trades"" that are often too powerful for small-to-medium-sized businesses.
Microservers could account for over 10% of the entire server market by 2016, up from just 0.2% in 2011, according to IDC. AMD must compete with Intel's Atom and ARM-based CPUs in this market, but it's still a promising new way for the company to generate fresh revenue.
Potential pitfallsHowever, AMD's computing and graphics segment, which accounted for 57% of its top line last year, is faring much worse. The segment's revenue fell 16% year over year in 2014 as its operating loss widened from $91 million to $478 million. That loss completely erased the $399 million in operating income generated by the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business. The problem is that the segment is being crushed by Intel in x86 CPUs and by NVIDIA in high-end graphics cards, also known as AIBs (add-in boards).

Intel dominates the PC and server markets while selling pricier chips, which puts AMD in the unenviable position of selling fewer chips at cheaper prices. Meanwhile, Intel has its own foundry, which it uses to manufacture new 14-nanometer chips including the fanless Broadwell CPUs.
AMD's chips are manufactured by GlobalFoundries, which was spun off from AMD's manufacturing facilities. GlobalFoundries said it will only start manufacturing 14nm chips in the ""first half of 2015"". As a result, AMD's road map remains focused on its 28nm Carrizo chips, and it probably won't launch 14nm chips until 2016.
As for graphics cards, AMD has steadily fallen behind market leader NVIDIA. According to research firm JPR, AMD's global AIB market share fell from 35% to 24% between the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2014, while Nvidia's share rose from 65% to 76%.
AMD has been trying to undercut NVIDIA on pricing instead. Yet lowering the average selling price hasn't helped AMD gain much ground against its rival. In the fourth quarter of 2014, JPR reported that AMD's overall PC graphics shipments declined 7% year over year as NVIDIA's rose 2.9%. AMD finished the quarter with 13.6% share of the entire GPU market, compared to NVIDIA's 15%. Intel, with its integrated graphics chips, accounted for the remainder of the market.
The verdictIn the end, AMD's weaknesses offset its strengths. Its lack of profitability and inability to turn around its computing and graphics segment overshadow the notable strengths of its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business. A few wild cards -- such as the recent management shake-up and buyout possibilities -- might attract some contrarian investors, but AMD still has much to prove before it can be considered a stable investment.

            ","Over the past five years, shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD)have cratered over 60%. The company, once considered a major threat to the Intel x86 business, lost its way in CPUs, tried to diversify into graphics cards, and then suffered through subsequent pricing wars on both fronts.

In a previous article, I highlighted three key weaknesses at the company -- competitive pressure from Intel and Nvidia, technological inferiority to new Intel chips, and executive turmoil. Today, we will examine the flip side and discuss three strengths investors may have overlooked.
1. Fresh leadership, fresh tacticsLast year, Dr. Lisa Su replaced Rory Read as CEO. Chip chief John Byrne, chief marketing officer Colette LaForce, and chief strategy officer Raj Naik abruptly departed earlier this year. While investors should certainly be concerned with such major changes at the executive level, they should also realize that Read, Byrne, LaForce, and Naik were not exactly steering AMD toward success.
Under Read, operating expenses declined, cash levels were stable around $1 billion, and he ensured that no new debt would come due until 2019. But AMD also scaled back its direct attacks against Intel in PCs and Nvidia in graphics cards, which resulted in lost market share in both categories.
Meanwhile, Su has a background in engineering that Read lacks, which might help AMD diversify into new product categories. 
Shortly before his departure, Byrne dismissed the notion that AMD should expand into the Internet of Things (IoT) to compete against Intel and ARM Holdings, bluntly telling VentureBeat that he was not ""in the business to lose money."" But as I mentioned before, it would be reckless to ignore the IoT market, which IDC forecasts will grow to $7.1 trillion by 2020. Su, who also took over for Byrne, has experience in IoT tech and could help the company expand into that space.
2. Growth in embedded and semi-custom solutionsAMD's core strength is its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business, which manufactures system on a chip (SoC) products. This segment produces components for the Sony PS4 and Microsoft Xbox One, currently the two best-selling consoles in the world. Their robust sales helped the segment boost revenue 51% year-over-year in 2014, accounting for 43% of the top line.
In addition to consoles, AMD has a growing footprint in low-power ""microservers"" that are dedicated to specific tasks, such as loading the background images of a website, and are usually purchased in clusters. By comparison, traditional servers -- mostly powered by Intel Xeon processors -- are powerful but expensive jacks of all trades. IDC expects microservers to account for over 10% of the entire server market by 2016, up from just 0.2% in 2011. 
If AMD Opteron processors can hold the line against Intel Atom and ARM-based SoCs in the microserver market, its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business will continue growing and eventually outweigh the importance of the x86 chip and GPU businesses. Moreover, if AMD changes its tune on IoT devices, the segment could grow even faster.
3. A tempting takeover targetLastly, AMD has been the subject of plenty of takeover rumors. Investors should never buy a beaten down stock hoping for a buyout, but they should understand what makes AMD a lucrative target.
Its most important asset is its long-term license to use the Intel x86 instruction set. This means that a larger, better-funded company could theoretically buy AMD and aggressively attack the near monopolies Intel enjoys in the notebook, desktop, and server markets. That is why AMD is frequently cited as a potential takeover target for companies like Oracle, Broadcom, and Qualcomm. The most recent rumor is that Chinese chipmaker BLX IC Design, which worked with AMD in the past, is interested in acquiring the company.
However, Intel previously tried to prevent AMD from spinning off its manufacturing facilities as GlobalFoundries, claiming that the company could not extend that license to a third party. Therefore, Intel will likely try to block an acquisition of the company. Intel could also try to nullify the x86 license if a takeover occurs, making AMD a much less attractive target. 
Despite those challenges, a market cap of $2.5 billion makes AMD a fairly affordable purchase for an ARM-licensee looking to expand into x86 processors.
The verdictIn my opinion, AMD is still a risky stock to own. However, a change in leadership, growth in embedded and semi-custom SoCs, and the appeal of its x86 license could all help the stock eventually bounce back. But for now, investors should proceed with caution until AMD shows signs of improvement in its long-suffering CPU and GPU businesses.

            ","For the past four years, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has maintained a roughly 60% unit market share in the discrete graphics card market, with the rest going to rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). New product launches and seasonality over that time drove some small fluctuations, but NVIDIA has been able to hang onto its lead.
The third quarter of 2014 marked a distinct change in this dynamic. NVIDIA saw a large increase in its market share, up to around 70%, and it appeared as though NVIDIA was starting to pull away from AMD. This could have just been a fluke, of course, but in the fourth quarter of 2014, NVIDIA's market share rose again, this time to 76%. That's about 11 percentage points higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.

Chart created by author; data from Jon Peddie Research
The graphics card market is starting to look an awful lot like the PC CPU market, where Intel dominates and AMD struggles to turn a profit. AMD needs a huge win with its upcoming launch of new graphics cards, expected sometime in the first half of this year. If it fails to claw back the market share that it's lost, the company risks becoming a bit player in the GPU market, leaving NVIDIA as the undisputed leader.
How did this happen? NVIDIA has benefited from launching an extremely popular pair of graphics cards last September, the GTX 970 and GTX 980. This forced AMD to slash prices across the board, as NVIDIA undercut existing AMD GPUs on price dramatically. The GTX 970 in particular, priced around $350, has proven extremely successful.
According to the Steam Hardware and Software Survey, the GTX 970 is used by more Steam users than any AMD family of GPUs, gaining this lead in the five months since its release. There has been some controversy surrounding the card; whether it ultimately affects sales or benefits AMD is an open question.
An AMD GPU doesn't show up on the survey until the 14th spot, behind eight NVIDIA GPUs and five Intel CPUs with integrated graphics. The AMD R9 200 series, which is AMD's latest high-end family of GPUs, is the 48th most popular graphics card. While this survey isn't a perfect representation of market share, it's likely a very good one, given that Steam users are by definition PC gamers.
The launch of the GTX 970 and 980 certainly contributed to the massive market share gains NVIDIA has enjoyed in the past two quarters. But this kind of thing didn't happen following other major product launches in the past. Instead, NVIDIA's market share stayed roughly the same at around 60%.
Part of this can be explained by the temporary demand created by cryptocurrency miners at the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014. AMD's GPUs are more efficient for mining cryptocurrency, and this helped drive GPU sales for AMD at the time. This demand is now gone, though, and that means a big market has dried up for AMD. This sudden loss of market share may have been more spread out over time had it not been for this temporary surge in demand.
Another component is that AMD has likely fallen behind technologically. The company has been slashing its research and development spending for years, and NVIDIA now outspends AMD despite the latter's far broader portfolio of products. NVIDIA's Maxwell graphics architecture is extremely efficient, and AMD still doesn't have an answer.
AMD needs a big win AMD has a lot riding on its upcoming GPUs. There have been plenty of rumors regarding the cards, but they still haven't been officially announced by the company. The high-end versions will reportedly use a new kind of high-bandwidth memory, giving them an advantage at high resolutions. Whether this leads to higher sales, given the tiny fraction of gamers currently using 4K displays, remains to be seen.
Originally, it was expected that AMD's new cards would be built on a 20nm process, but it's now rumored that both NVIDIA and AMD are skipping 20nm completely. This means any efficiency gains will need to come from AMD's new graphics architecture. This could prove to be a problem, as a new rumor suggests that only the highest-end variants from AMD will be built on a new architecture, with the rest using the current one. What this means if true is unclear, but it does seem strange, and it will make it much more difficult to compete with NVIDIA's midrange Maxwell offerings.
AMD doesn't just need to produce good products, it needs to blow away NVIDIA, both on performance and price. This is starting to seem unlikely, although these rumors could certainly prove incorrect.
If AMD doesn't end up winning back a considerable chunk of market share from NVIDIA when it launches these new cards, it may be time to conclude that NVIDIA's lead has become insurmountable, much like Intel's lead in the PC CPU market.
NVIDIA doesn't have the same advantages that Intel has; both NVIDIA and AMD rely on third-party foundries for manufacturing, unlike Intel. But slashing R&D spending typically doesn't lead to market dominance, and that's exactly what AMD has been doing. The company's PC segment is losing money as it continues to bleed market share to both Intel in CPUs and NVIDIA in GPUs, and the game consoles are the only thing keeping the company afloat.
If AMD doesn't have a smash hit with these new cards, and if NVIDIA doesn't make a huge mistake, NVIDIA could end up becoming the Intel of the graphics card market.

            ","Shares of chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have fallen 15% over the past 12 months as rival Intel has (NASDAQ:INTC) rallied almost 40%. In fiscal 2014, AMD reported a net loss of $403 million, sharply down from a loss of $83 million in 2013, as it struggled to remain relevant in the CPU and GPU markets. 
And things could get much worse for AMD before they get any better. Let's look at three key reasons AMD stock could keep falling this year.
1. Crushed between two giantsFirst and foremost, AMD's margins are getting crushed between Intel's x86 chips and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) high-end graphics cards.
Intel respectively controlled 98.5%, 90.3%, and 81.8% of the server, notebook, and desktop CPU markets in the third quarter of 2014, according to IDC. AMD, left to feed off the scraps of those markets, had to keep selling cheaper chips than Intel to remain competitive. AMD acquired graphics card maker ATI in 2006 to diversify its core business away from CPUs, but that tactic simply sent it into a multiyear price war against NVIDIA. 
This two-pronged war means that AMD has little freedom to raise prices on CPUs or GPUs to offset margin declines. A comparison of AMD's operating margins against Intel and NVIDIA over the past five years shows us where AMD is headed.

On the bright side, AMD's Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business has been booming, fueled by strong sales of its system-on-a-chip, or SOC, products for Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PS4 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One. Last quarter, the segment's revenue surged 51% year over year in 2014, accounting for 43% of AMD's top line.
2. Falling behind the tech curveAMD recently unveiled its Carrizo SoCs for mobile devices. These SOCs are aimed at gaining ground against ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH)-licensed CPUs, which are installed in the majority of tablets and smartphones worldwide, and Intel's Broadwell chips, which are installed in many newer tablets and 2-in-1 devices.
Carrizo is built on older 28nm tech, compared wwith Intel's 14nm Core M. Intel can develop 14nm chips more efficiently because it has its own foundry.  AMD spun off its foundry joint venture as GlobalFoundries in 2009, and then abandoned that stake in 2012. GlobalFoundries, which still manufactures AMD's chips, plans to start mass production of 14nm chips in the ""first half"" of 2015, but it remains a step behind Intel.
A key difference between 14nm and 28nm chips is that the former is a fanless design, while the latter isn't. This makes Broadwell chips, like the Core M, more attractive to companies that want to produce ultra-thin tablets and 2-in-1 devices. 

Lenovo's Yoga Pro 3 runs on a Core M processor.
AMD is also noticeably absent from the Internet of Things market, or IOT, which is a major blind spot considering that IDC projects global spending on IOT tech to rise from $4.8 trillion in 2012 to $8.9 trillion in 2020. Intel, by comparison, already set up a dedicated IOT business segment last July.
Therefore, Intel's technological superiority, along with its aggressive subsidization plans for its mobile partners, could further reduce AMD's market share.
3. Turmoil at the topLastly, AMD replaced several of its top executives over the past year. Last October, Lisa Su replaced Rory Read as CEO and then promptly announced plans to lay off 7% of AMD's staff. Last month, chip chief John Byrne, Chief Marketing Officer Colette LaForce, and Chief Strategy Officer Raj Naik all stepped down.
In an official statement, AMD claimed that the shakeup would ""sharpen"" the company's execution and position it for growth. But it also indicates that AMD might be suffering from internal conflicts of interest, which could cause it to lose focus as Intel and NVIDIA further marginalize its core businesses.
The takeawaySome contrarian investors might believe that AMD could bounce back on rising console sales or get bought out. Unfortunately, neither reason offsets its lack of pricing power in CPUs and GPUs, its technological inferiority to Intel, and its management issues. Until AMD can address all three of those issues in a meaningful manner, this is one beaten-down stock that I'd avoid.

            ","In the world of PC gaming, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Direct3D, part of DirectX, has long been the dominant graphics API. Almost all high-profile PC games use DirectX, which is tied exclusively to Windows, making the OS the standard for PC gaming.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) attempted to change this last year with the introduction of its own proprietary graphics API, Mantle. Mantle vastly reduced the amount of CPU overhead compared to DirectX, leading to big gains in performance in situations where the CPU was the bottleneck.
I argued last year that Mantle had absolutely no chance of success, and that it would provide no benefit whatsoever to AMD, because the next version of Direct X would introduce the same efficiency gains. With the release of Windows 10 and DirectX 12 coming later this year, the first benchmarks comparing DirectX 12 to Mantle have been released. It's not pretty for AMD.
DirectX 12 is the real deal The folks over at Anandtech recently tested an early version of DirectX 12, and the results show two things.

Source: Anandtech
First, the gains in performance compared to DirectX 11 are substantial, and in cases where the CPU is the bottleneck, big gains are very possible. Second, DirectX 12 produces similar results on AMD cards compared to Mantle. Mantle is still a bit faster in most cases, but given DirectX 12 is still months away from release, this difference may be temporary.
Both DirectX 12 and Mantle achieve these performance gains by eliminating much of the overhead involved with sending commands to the GPU. DirectX 11 hits a severe bottleneck if the number of commands grows too large, and it looks like DirectX 12 will fix this problem.
Why DirectX 12 is important for Microsoft One reason, although certainly not the only reason, that Windows has remained the dominant PC operating system is gaming. The fact that almost all PC games are built on DirectX, instead of the alternative cross-platform OpenGL, gives Windows an enormous advantage. According to the Steam hardware and software survey, about 95.5% of Steam users are running some form of Windows, with the scraps split between Mac and Linux.
Maintaining Windows' dominance in the PC gaming market is critical for Microsoft, and that requires DirectX to remain the de facto standard graphics API. Mantle was always unlikely to usurp DirectX, given that it only works on a subset of AMD products, and neither Intel nor NVIDIA was ever going to support it. But allowing DirectX to fall too far behind could have opened the door for the next version of OpenGL, which will also introduce gains in efficiency. This now appears unlikely given the early DirectX 12 performance numbers.
Why AMD's Mantle will lead nowhere Mantle was always a long shot, but at the very least it likely spurred Microsoft to focus on efficiency. Mantle has gained the support of a decent number of games and game engines, but it's difficult to fathom where Mantle fits once DirectX 12 is released. There may still be some performance benefits for AMD's GPUs, but with NVIDIA the market leader in discrete GPUs and Intel the overwhelming market leader in integrated GPUs, supporting Mantle likely won't make much sense for developers.
AMD's PC business has been falling apart recently, and it was honestly a waste of resources to develop an alternative graphics API. It's now clear from the DirectX 12 performance figures that Mantle's advantage is going to largely disappear later this year, and it's also clear from NVIDIA's market share gains that Mantle has done exactly nothing to boost AMD's GPU business.
AMD deserves credit for starting the conversation on eliminating graphics API overhead. But that conversation will be finished without it, and AMD will get no credit where it matters: the bottom line.

            ","
New investors are often attracted to penny stocks due to the large opportunity for profits they seem to present. ""If the shares can just trade up from $0.10 to $0.20 each, I'd double my money"" is a popular line of thinking.
But penny stocks are inherently dangerous: A cesspool of failed companies, frauds, and schemes intended to transfer money from the greedy newbie to their motivated, if unsavory, operators.
The history of penny stocksBefore electronic trading and discount brokerage firms, penny stocks got a bad rap for being prohibitively expensive. In the old days, you'd pay as much as a quarter-point ($0.25) to buy or sell a share of stock.
This was the brokerage firm's commission. And because it was set in stone -- it didn't matter whether a share traded for $1 or $100 -- the commission made up a much bigger portion of your investment in penny stocks than it did on pricier shares.
Many mutual funds enacted policies to avoid stocks which trade for less than $5 per share for reasons of expense (they pay commissions, too) or because of their speculative nature. And over time, it just so happened that the feeling became something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. People avoided penny stocks, and thus it became generally accepted that only the worst companies would let their shares trade at penny stock prices. 
Penny stocks todayThe widely accepted definition of penny stocks has been somewhat extended to cover other, higher-priced stocks which also trade in less-regulated, over-the-counter markets.
Over-the-counter stocks are generally less liquid, and they have fewer requirements to remain listed. Many don't even bother to file financial reports on time, or at all. And they're often managed by people with a less-than-stellar pedigree.
Conflicts of interest are especially common. I've seen it all -- from company-owned planes that are used more for the executives' pleasure than business, to companies that pay above-market rents because the CEO just so happens to also be the landlord.
That isn't to say that these bad behaviors are inherent in penny stocks, just that they're more common. One of the benefits of obscurity is that some managers can get away with a lot more without the benefit of prying eyes looking over their every financial filing.
Should you buy penny stocks?If I were to paint with broad strokes, I'd recommend avoiding them entirely. There are, however, legitimate companies that happen to have low share prices. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), a company which makes many of the chips in electronics ranging from laptops to phones, has long traded for prices in the penny stock range of less than $5. 
Likewise, Roche Holding (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY), a Swiss health care company many would recognize, has shares listed on the over-the-counter market to allow American investors to invest in it.
AMD and Roche are legitimate businesses, and are not penny stocks. They file regular financial reports, adequately disclose their business lines to investors, and are clearly not illegitimate companies. They just happen to have a single trait of most penny stocks -- a low per-share price or an OTC listing.
 Many penny stock and OTC-listed companies are nothing more than shells. They include the likes of marijuana companies that exert more effort to market their stock than their products, and ""dark"" companies that haven't filed financial statements in years.
A large number (by my count over 40%) of OTC stocks are considered ""grey market"" stocks, which do not require any filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Can you imagine investing in a business, having no idea what it earns, or even what its business model entails? That's the case for nearly half of stocks that trade over the counter.
Though they may seem like an easy and simple way to quick profits, know that penny stocks are anything but. The ""easy"" way to get rich in stocks is to buy good businesses and own them for a very, very long time -- years, if not decades. Investors dominate the list of Forbes 400 billionaires, but I can assure you it wasn't penny stocks that created their wealth.

            ","Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been struggling against rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market, losing market share and reporting dismal fourth-quarter earnings. AMD is expected to launch a new batch of GPUs during the first half of this year, and while I'm not optimistic that a single product launch can right the ship, the company does have a trick up its sleeve. AMD is rumored to be using high-bandwidth-memory, or HBM, in some of its new GPUs, providing drastically more memory bandwidth compared to NVIDIA's products. AMD needs any advantage that it can get, but how meaningful of an impact will HBM really have?
Why memory bandwidth is important GPUs process a tremendous amount of data per second. While performance is ultimately limited by a GPU's processing power, a potential bottleneck is the rate at which a GPU can read data from its own memory. This rate is called the memory bandwidth.
To get a sense of how much data is involved, imagine a graphics card with 4GB of memory running a game at sixty frames-per-second. Each frame, the GPU needs to deal with all of the data necessary to draw the scene, including data representing all of the objects, like characters and buildings, and textures that are applied to those objects. Given the visual detail and richness of modern PC games, an enormous amount of data is needed to make the image on the screen look realistic.
If this hypothetical graphics cards needs to access all 4GB of its memory once per frame, the memory bandwidth needs to be 240 GB/s. This is a simplification: Some data may need to be accessed more than once per frame, and some less frequently, but this estimate is a good ballpark figure. NVIDIA's high-end GTX 980, for example, has a memory bandwidth of 224 GB/s, allowing it to access nearly all of its 4GB of memory every frame.
As the screen resolution increases, the GPU needs to deal with an increasing amount of data. A 4K monitor has quadruple the number of pixels compared to a 1080p monitor, and that means all of the per-pixel data that the GPU churns through quadruples as well.
Star Citizen, an upcoming crowdfunded PC game, will have support for not only 4K resolutions, but 8K resolutions as well. This requires the development team to include 4K and 8K textures for any object that gets close to the player; a lower-resolution texture would appear blurry. The GPU memory bandwidth required to deal with all of this data will need to be truly enormous, to say the least.
Existing graphics cards can play games at 4K resolutions, but not particularly well at high settings. NVIDIA's GTX 980 has trouble hitting playable framerates in many games, and part of the reason is likely its low memory bandwidth.
AMD could own 4K gaming, at least for a while AMD is reportedly going to use HBM in its high-end graphics cards this year, providing a memory bandwidth as high at 640GB/s, according to unconfirmed specifications. That's nearly triple what the GTX 980 offers, and this should help AMD's new GPUs excel at 4K gaming.
NVIDIA will eventually adopt HBM, but it's unlikely to happen until GPUs based on its next-gen architecture, Pascal, are released sometime in 2016. This gap will give AMD's products a distinct advantage in the 4K gaming market for a while.
However, the ultimate importance of this advantage is questionable. The percentage of PC gamers using 4K monitors is currently minuscule, and with all of this extra bandwidth largely unnecessary at lower resolutions, being first may not lead to many extra sales for AMD. Steam's hardware and software survey puts the percentage of its users with a monitor above a resolution of 1080p at just 3.25%. Only 0.03% of users have monitors with 4K resolutions.
Another potential issue is the price. HBM is a new memory technology, which means that it's going to be expensive. We won't know how expensive until AMD's new GPUs are officially announced, but the highest-end GPU may end up being priced well above NVIDIA's GTX 980.
Now, it's possible that AMD's new GPUs will spur adoption of 4K monitors, given that most existing GPUs can't handle 4K very well today. Buy 4K monitors are still quite expensive, and 1080p monitors are far cheaper in comparison. I suspect that 4K monitors will need to become much more affordable for 4K gaming to go mainstream, and that puts a limit on the benefits potentially realized by AMD for being first to market with an HBM graphics card.
If the rumors prove true, AMD's use of HBM will certainly give it an advantage. But given the meager adoption rate of 4K monitors, it probably won't matter very much in the grand scheme of things.

            ","To put it bluntly, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had a terrible fourth quarter. Revenue fell 22% year over year, according to the processor maker's latest earnings release, while earnings, adjusted for some big write-offs, landed at breakeven. While the gaming consoles business kept AMD afloat, the PC business appears to be falling apart. Computing and graphics revenue fell 16% year over year, with the segment losing $56 million during the quarter. Additionally, an inventory write-off related to the company's APUs doesn't exactly vindicate the company's strategy.
Big problemsWhile the PC market has stabilized, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reporting rising PC chip volumes in both the fourth quarter and 2014 as a whole, AMD is still suffering from huge sales declines. With AMD grouping CPUs and GPUs in the computing and graphics segment, it's difficult to tell exactly how each business is doing. But it's clear Intel continues to win market share from AMD, despite already dominating the market.
Of course, Intel has some enormous advantages. While AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its chips, Intel produces its own chips, and it is shipping its new Broadwell processors built on a 14-nanometer process. AMD is still stuck at 28 nanometers, and its upcoming Carrizo APUs, set to launch in the first half of this year, will remain a generation behind Intel. This will make it difficult, if not impossible, for AMD to keep up on power efficiency.
During the fourth quarter, AMD wrote off $58 million of inventory related to its desktop APU products. This should not be ignored: AMD's entire PC strategy has revolved around the powerful integrated graphics in its APUs, but it appears demand simply isn't there. In contrast, Intel reported that its desktop CPU volume fell just 1% during the fourth quarter.
The average selling price of AMD's GPUs also declined year over year, although the company did not disclose any information about volume. Part of this weakness is likely due to the demand from cryptocurrency miners, which buoyed AMD's GPU business in late 2013 and early 2014, vanishing, as pointed out by CEO Lisa Su during the company's conference call. During the third quarter, rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) claimed about 70% of the GPU market by unit volume, and its recent GPU products forced AMD to slash prices late last year.
This is what a train wreck looks like It seems the investment thesis for AMD over the past few years has been that, while things aren't great now, the next batch of products will return the company to prosperity. AMD is launching new APUs later this year, as well as new GPUs, and both come with a bit of hype.
It's the same story, though, every time AMD launches a new product. Expectations are high, but ultimately the company fails to deliver. Both Intel and NVIDIA keep winning market share, and those promising APUs had to be written off in the fourth quarter. AMD is starting to sound like a broken record.
AMD expects revenue during the first quarter to decline by 15% sequentially, anticipating just $1.05 billion in total. The company did not mention how big of a year-over-year decline this would represent, probably because that number is much scarier. AMD is guiding for an astonishing 25% year-over-year revenue decline next quarter. It also expects lower revenue than it collected in the first quarter of 2013, which occurred well before the game consoles even launched. 
At this point, any profits from the game console business are being eaten by PC losses and interest payments. Research and development spending is collapsing, down 19% year over year during the fourth quarter. While cost reductions will help profitability, it's hard to imagine how AMD is supposed to keep up with Intel and NVIDIA by constantly slashing R&D.
Banking on a miracle second half, driven by new product launches, is extremely optimistic. Past new product releases have done little to fix AMD's PC business, and it doesn't look any different this time around. AMD doesn't have the resources to fight multiple wars on multiple fronts with both Intel and NVIDIA, and this is showing in its results. AMD's PC business is unraveling, and there appears to be little hope it can be saved.

            ","The S&P 500 was up over 11% last year, exceeding many analyst expectations. Despite the bullish market, some companies still underperformed. Sometimes it is the entire industry taking a hit, and other times, the poor performance is specific to an individual company. 
Today, three Motley Fool contributors weigh in on the turnaround stories they're watching for 2015: Coach (NYSE:TPR),  Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and InvenSense (NYSE:INVN).
Andres Cardenal (Coach): Coach made a series of expensive mistakes over the last several years -- the company expanded too quickly, designs did not resonate well among consumers, and excessive promotions eroded the brand image. However, management is actively trying to turn things around, and Coach is an interesting candidate to watch in 2015 and beyond.
The company is reducing its store count and cutting back on promotions in order to recover its aspirational halo. It also hired Stuart Vevers as the new creative director in September 2013, and he is working to transform Coach into a full lifestyle brand.
The December quarter will be the first full quarter including sales from his new collection. Considering the importance of the holiday shopping season, the next earnings report should give investors an opportunity to evaluate Coach's ability to get back on track.
Also, while total sales in North America declined 19% year-over-year to $634 million during the third quarter, international revenues were up 4% to $381 million. Sales in China, a particularly promising market for the company, jumped 10% during the period, so international markets seem to offer considerable room for growth in the mid-term.
For what it's worth, management believes the new collection is performing according to expectations, and CEO Victor Luis said in the last conference call that press coverage for this new collection was ""overwhelmingly positive, building on the response to Fall 2014 and driving fashion, credibility, and buzz.""
Anders Bylund (Advanced Micro Devices): AMD had a terrible year in 2014. Share prices plunged 32% lower, mostly in a difficult span from September through October. The microchip designer missed Wall Street earnings targets in each of it two latest quarters, and analysts expect more pain ahead.
AMD CEO Lisa Su. Source: AMD
But the plucky semiconductor underdog is under new management, and I think that recently appointed CEO Lisa Su has what it takes to turn the beat around. The market, on the other hand, begs to differ.
The biggest drop in October had nothing to do with soft earnings but sprung from the news that Su would be replacing Rory Read in the corner office. The market reaction was like a huge vote of no confidence in the new CEO.
I'm here to tell you that Su knows the business inside and out, having run AMD's global (read: international) business unit since 2012. She comes with a rock-solid technical pedigree with an MIT doctorate in electrical engineering. She's spent more than 20 years running technical and leadership operations at the chip divisions at Freescale, IBM, and Texas Instruments. She's a much needed tech-oriented upgrade from Read's deeper business-side focus.
Rory Read started pointing AMD in a new direction. Su continues to move the company out of the commodity PC processor market and deeper into custom products for markets like gaming consoles and the Internet of Things.
Lisa Su is the right person with the right strategy, at exactly the right time. If the market understands these things in 2015, AMD's stock should run higher once again.
Ashraf Eassa (InvenSense): Over the last year, shares of MEMS vendor InvenSense have lost about 35% -- pretty rough for a company that just won a spot in the latest Apple iPhones!
Last quarter, the company saw a large drop in gross profit margins as a result of an (unexpected) inventory write down. I believe this shook investor confidence, particularly as poor inventory management lies squarely on the shoulders of the people running the company.
InvenSense also reported margin pressure as a result of high customer concentration at Apple and Samsung, which stoked the fears of the risks typically associated with this issue -- continued margin pressure and the potentially huge financial impact of losing a major customer. 
As I've indicated previously, I think the InvenSense ""turnaround"" story in 2015 will consist of two parts. First, InvenSense needs to avoid the execution mishaps that it suffered in 2014. The company really can't afford any negative surprises in the near future if it wants to restore investor confidence. Things happen and no company will execute 100% each-and-every quarter, but InvenSense needs to take particular care in the near-term to set expectations properly and execute well on those expectations.
Next, the company needs to prove that it can, without further eroding its gross profit margin profile, keep its premium mobile device wins while at the same time delivering on its stated goal to push more into the midrange phone market. This could be demonstrated by growing the business at a rapid clip over the next year or so, while maintaining at least a 45% gross profit margin.
InvenSense reports its quarterly earnings on Jan. 29th, and I look forward to seeing how the company performed relative to guidance and what it ends up guiding to for the following quarter.

            ","Image source: AMD.
So you're interested in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). I hope you have a strong stomach, or a duffel bag full of antacids.
When the semiconductor designer reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday evening, the report kicked off a rollicking roller-coaster ride. The stock opened Wednesday's trading session at two-year lows, but immediately bounced back in a big way. Just 40 minutes into the market session, the difference between Wednesday's highs and lows was more than 11%. By 3 p.m., AMD's stock was up some 5% from the previous day's close at $2.24.
Against that backdrop, it can be hard to tell whether AMD's fourth quarter was a big disappointment or a positive turning point. So let me walk you through what's going on here.
First, let's get the basic numbers out of the way.
Analysts were expecting AMD to report net earnings of $0.01 per share on sales of $1.24 billion. Revenues fell 22% year over year to land exactly at the analyst target, yielding breakeven earnings. So in terms of pure earnings figures, the quarter was a slight disappointment.
More to the point, AMD staged a bit of a business revival in 2013 and 2014, but this report took the edge off those gains:

AMD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
But if every trend is negative, how come the stock is rising again? Here's a novel idea: Investors may be looking beyond the current quarter for signs of a sustainable turnaround. And the numbers rarely tell the whole story.
AMD CEO Lisa Su. Source: AMD.
Recently appointed CEO Lisa Su certainly presented AMD's results in a positive light. ""We made progress diversifying our business, ramping design wins and improving our balance sheet this past year despite challenges in our PC business,"" she said in prepared remarks. The business mix is shifting away from mass-market PC processors and graphics chips, and AMD is leaning more on semi-custom products for embedded systems and game consoles.
In fact, inventories of PC-style products such as CPUs and add-in graphics boards were painfully high at the start of the fourth quarter. AMD took steps to correct the oversupply by reducing manufacturing orders, which led to ""short-term pressure in the business"" but sets AMD up for a stronger 2015.
Here's where the good news starts.
Su knows that AMD is winning in the semi-custom market while losing badly to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the traditional PC segment. Her solution is simple: apply the operating discipline and lessons learned in the custom chip sector to the ailing PC market.
""We clearly have more work to do to improve the overall revenue and financial performance of this segment,"" Su said. ""We must think differently in 2015 about our market approach and investment priorities.""
She's remixing this division to sell more high-end products and fewer of the truly mass-market chips on the lower end. That means leaving some easy but unprofitable sales on the table, but improving profit margins.
On a grander scale, AMD managed to grow full-year sales for the first time since 2011 while also delivering positive non-GAAP earnings.
So Su is not afraid to roll up her sleeves and get some serious work done. AMD's business approach is overdue for an update, and she's getting it done.
As an Intel shareholder, I'm not exactly shaking in my boots over the threat AMD poses right now. But Su's detailed tech insights may set AMD on a path that leads to becoming a serious Intel challenger once again. Right now, she's saddled with repairing the mess that predecessor Rory Read left behind. It's not easy work, and I wouldn't suggest loading your retirement nest egg into AMD stock today. But if she can pull it off, she'll spark an impressive turnaround in AMD's ailing stock as well.
So this one's for the gamblers, the speculators, and those with a bit of disposable funds to play around with. I'm tempted to buy a small ticket to the AMD lottery myself, if only to see what Su can do with it. In the meantime, I just gave AMD a thumbs-up rating in our Motley Fool CAPS system.

            ","Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have plunged 37% over the past 12 months as the struggling chipmaker announced layoffs and missed Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations under new CEO Lisa Su. 
On Monday, AMD announced the departure of three top executives: Senior Vice President John Byrne, Chief Marketing Officer Colette LaForce, and Chief Strategy Officer Raj Naik. Byrne notably only spent seven months as general manager of the company's computing and graphics division.
Just last week, Byrne discussed his view of the Internet of Things, or IoT during a VentureBeat interview at CES 2015. When asked whether AMD would expand into the IoT market as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has done with wearables and tiny Quark chips, Byrne flatly replied, ""I'm not in the business to lose money. Share and revenue is nice but so is profitability."" Byrne emphasized that AMD should focus on improving the performance and power efficiency of its x86 chips instead.

But now that Byrne has moved on, it might be time for AMD to reevaluate its position on IoT, which could prevent it from being crushed between Intel's x86 chips and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs.
The business of the Internet of ThingsThe concept of IoT is that everything -- wearables, cars, home appliances, and more -- will be connected to one another through various wireless standards. Research firm IDC believes the global IoT market will grow from $1.9 trillion in 2013 to $7.1 trillion by 2020. Presumably, that rising tide could lift chipmakers such as Intel, networking companies such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Internet giants including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Intel's Internet of Things division consists of embedded chipsets that are used in retail environments, industrial sites, buildings, homes, and transportation. Over the first nine months of 2014, revenue at Intel's IoT group rose 23% year over year to $1.55 billion as operating income improved 26% to $431 million. While Intel's IoT segment only accounted for about 4% of its revenue and operating income during that period, its double-digit growth and profitability strongly suggest IoT might not be a money-losing venture for AMD after all.
AMD, though, lacks Intel's market clout -- according to IDC's third-quarter numbers, Intel controls 98.5% of the server market, 90.3% of the notebook market, and 81.8% of the desktop market. This means Intel can likely sell more embedded solutions on the foundations of its x86 market share than AMD can.
Birds of preyThat's not to say AMD does not have any embedded products at all. Last year, the company unveiled several such products -- Adelaar, Steppe Eagle, Bald Eagle, and Hierofalcon -- to expand into industrial control and automation, digital gaming, medical imaging, digital surveillance, smart TVs, and other non-PC businesses.
While those ""birds of prey"" are certainly scouting ahead for a possible expansion into IoT, AMD hasn't split those technologies into a separate IoT business in the way Intel has. Instead, they reside in AMD's enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (server and embedded processors, systems-on-chip, engineering services, and royalties) business.
In the first nine months of 2014, revenue from that segment more than doubled to $1.8 billion and accounted for 42% of AMD's top line. That growth was helped by robust system-on-chip sales of for Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 4 consoles.
Like a frog in boiling waterAMD has always been considered the cheaper alternative to Intel and NVIDIA, respectively, in x86 chips and high-end graphics cards. The problem is that whenever AMD's market share declines, margins fall as it tries to generate fresh revenue growth with cheaper products.

In the first nine months of 2014, AMD's computing and graphics revenue (which accounted for 58% of its top line) fell 13% year over year as it posted an operating loss of $20 million. AMD is also falling behind the technological curve when it comes to mobile processors -- its new 28-nanometer mobile Carrizo system-on-chip might not appeal to tablet and two-in-one manufacturers, which are already experimenting with Intel's 14 nm Core M chips.
As AMD's market share remains under pressure in x86 chips and GPUs, it is increasingly finding itself being cornered by Intel. I believe AMD's revenue will keep declining unless the company increases the weight of its higher-growth embedded devices and system-on-chip offerings on its top line. Expanding the company's IoT efforts would be a reasonable way to do so, and would be a solid starting point for Byrne's successor.

            ","A well-known storyline in the PC processor market is that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the dominant player in what Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) former CEO once described as an ""unhealthy duopoly,"" has been taking market segment share away from AMD for some time. According to Citigroup's Chris Danely (via Barron's), Intel continues to do so at the expense of its smaller rival.
The story so far At the high end of the PC market, Intel's PC chips have done extremely well against AMD's offerings. However, AMD had for some time successfully deployed relatively quick, purpose-built, low-cost processors for the lower end of the market. These went up against the old Atom processors, but those Atom chips offered awful performance while AMD's comparable offerings were quite good. It's no surprise AMD did well. 
In fact, AMD did so well that Intel executive, Kirk Skaugen, admitted at an investor conference last year that the company's share in the value portion of the PC market had dropped below 50%. At the time, Skaugen also expressed confidence that the company would win back share with the Bay Trail-M and Bay Trail-D processors launched in late 2013, particularly as those processors had more competitive cost structures than what Intel had used previously in that segment.
Given that Intel reported a 14% increase in its low-cost PC processor revenue during 2014, while AMD's PC-related revenues crumbled, it's a safe bet that Intel gained material share -- just as it had aimed to.

More of the same probably coming in 2015 I expect this trend to continue throughout 2015. In the midrange and high end of the PC market, Intel's products are extremely competitive, as has been the case for quite some time. And at the lower end of the market, I expect Intel's products to become even more competitive.
Keep in mind that Intel's Bay Trail-M/D chips, while offering very good power consumption and CPU performance, lacked raw graphics performance relative to the AMD parts. While AMD has not released the full specifications of its just-announced Carrizo-L chip, slated to hit the market in mid-2015, Intel is reportedly launching the 14-nanometer successors to Bay Trail-M/D, known as Braswell, in the third quarter of this year.
I believe these will offer better power efficiency than the AMD models, as Braswell will be a 14-nanometer part while Carrizo-L will remain on 28-nanometers. While it's possible, or even likely, that Carrizo-L will offer better raw graphics performance than the highest-end Braswell chips, I think it will require far more power to get that performance.
For low-cost thin, light, and fanless systems, I imagine Braswell will be a more attractive solution than the Carrizo-L part. As a result, I would not be surprised to see further share loss for AMD in the PC market this year. 
2016 is the open question While the market segment share trends outlined here seem reasonable based on what we know, it's too early to call any trends for 2016. Intel will, of course, compete quite fiercely with Skylake and its 10-nanometer Cannonlake part, but AMD also plans to launch its next-generation X86 architecture known as Zen.
AMD bulls are optimistic that Zen, which is the X86 counterpart to the clean-sheet K12 architecture, will improve AMD's competitiveness considerably on the CPU side of things. This part is also reportedly set to be built on a 14/16-nanometer foundry FinFET processes, which should narrow the very wide process gap that seems to exist between AMD's Carrizo/Carrizo-L (28-nanometer) and Intel's Broadwell/Skylake/Braswell (14-nanometer).

            ","Not content with its dependence on the market for traditional PCs, Advanced Micro Devices'(NASDAQ:AMD) recent turnaround strategy has centered on delivering silicon for what it calls semi-custom solutions: PC-like devices powered by slightly customized AMD processors.
There is no better example of AMD's strategy in action than the latest video game consoles: Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) Wii U, Sony's PlayStation 4, and Microsoft's Xbox One all use AMD chips.
Its exposure to the industry gives the company a unique perspective -- as a major supplier, AMD is well-suited to forecast upcoming devices. Last month, it did exactly that. At a Raymond James technology conference, AMD's CFO, Devinder Kumar, announced that his company had secured design wins for two upcoming devices, at least one of which could be a gaming console.
Kumar's comments""I'm pleased to report we have those design wins,"" Kumar said, noting that the company had previously told investors to expect two new semi-custom designs from the company. ""Those parts will get introduced in 2016 ... at least one will be beyond gaming.""
From AMD's perspective, the devices could prove vital: According to Kumar, they could add $1 billion to AMD's revenue over a period of three years from 2016 onward. That's fairly significant, as AMD generated just $1.6 billion of revenue in 2013.
However, their exact nature remains largely unknown. Kumar's wording (""at least one will be beyond gaming"") leaves a lot of possibilities open. Still, it seems fair to say that at least one -- and possibly both -- of these products will play games in some capacity.
Nintendo admits it's working on a new consoleA handheld video game console from Nintendo is a strong possibility. Nintendo's current handheld, the 3DS, is almost four years old. In the past, the Japanese video game giant has released new handheld consoles on a regular basis, launching a new product every four to six years.
Although the market for dedicated handheld consoles has been eroded by the growth of smartphones and tablets, Nintendo's management remains committed to its long-standing strategy. Last month, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto told the Associated Press that his company was hard at work on its next-generation of devices.
Nintendo's 3DS uses an ARM-based processor, and given ARM's advantage in power consumption, the 3DS' successor will likely do the same. That would've been a problem for AMD in the past, but earlier this year, the company secured an ARM license, allowing it to offer both ARM and x86-based processors.
According to Kumar, one of AMD's semi-custom design wins also uses an ARM-based processor. Could it be the next Nintendo handheld? Other AMD executives have made supportive statements -- last June, AMD's Saeid Moshkelani told Barron's that AMD had great interest in the handheld gaming space, noting that despite widespread skepticism, Nintendo's ""3DS is still selling.""
A new entrant?A new console from Sony or Microsoft would be quite a surprise, given the relatively recent debut of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. If AMD isn't making a game device for Nintendo, it might be building a processor for a non-traditional player.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has shown great interest in the space in recent months, hiring major game developers and buying a video game studio outright, in addition to its purchase of the popular video game streaming service, Twitch. Amazon's set-top box, the Fire TV, allows its owners to play video games, though the graphical fidelity is lackluster. A more powerful game console from the e-commerce giant would not be particularly surprising.
There are other possibilities. Android TV, a modified version of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) mobile operating system designed to power set-top boxes, has attracted the attention of several gaming firms. Razer, a company known primarily for its gaming PC peripherals, unveiled the Android TV-powered Forge TV at CES last week. Forge TV sports a Qualcomm chip, but a similar product powered by AMD silicon could eventually make its way to market.
Betting on semi-customUnfortunately, these gaming wins have done little for AMD shareholders. Since the debut of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in Nov. 2013, AMD shares have lost roughly 25% of their value, badly underperforming the broader market. Despite bringing in revenue, AMD's console contracts have been criticized for their low margins.
The same may ultimately hold true for AMD's two new design wins. Still, it's evidence that AMD's plan -- derive 50% of its revenue from high-growth markets, including semi-custom solutions -- is on track.

            ","In 2013, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) outlined a strategy to win back share in the server market after losing significant ground to larger rival, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD asserted it would be ""the leader in ARM servers"" and that it would have ""substantial share of the X86 CPU market"" at some point in the future.
As we enter 2015, it is worth looking at AMD's progress in the server market since those initial announcements.
The story on ARM so far Advanced Micro Devices announced in July that developer kits powered by the Seattle processor were available for purchase. Then, at Hot Chips 2014, AMD did a deeper technical disclosure of the Seattle chip. Since then, though, AMD has been relatively quiet about its dense server efforts.
As Charlie Demerjian of SemiAccurate pointed out last month, two major ARM server chip vendors are now actually selling parts: Cavium and Applied Micro. His article takes a dig at AMD, stating that ""there would be three if the soap opera that is AMD was anything more than infinite but hollow press releases.""
At any rate, while Seattle is a real, working chip, it's not clear whether it is in production yet, and if it is, whether it has many -- if any -- major customers. This will probably become clearer over time.
What about X86? While there has much fanfare around its ARM efforts, AMD has made clear it plans to continue competing in the X86 server chip market. Planet 3DNow! (via WCCFTech) has posted the following AMD server road map, which is current through November 2013:

Source: Planet 3DNow!
According to this road map, AMD has no plans to update its two-socket and four-socket CPUs in 2015. It does, however, plan to bring two new X86 chips to market: Toronto APU and Toronto CPU. These will apparently integrate two Excavator modules/four Excavator x86 cores, support DDR3/DDR4, have PCIe3 support, and come as single, integrated system-on-chip parts.
The main difference between the two chips is that the APU will feature integrated graphics while the CPU apparently will not.
It seems that the ""small"" AMD x86 cores do not make an appearance here, with AMD opting to address any market requiring many small cores with ARM and any markets requiring more per-core performance with its ""big"" X86 cores.
What does AMD's competitive positioning look like in 2015? I don't think this road map is going to be particularly competitive with what Intel should have this year. The aging Warsaw CPUs (32-nanometer Piledriver) will find it difficult to compete with Intel's Haswell-EP and, potentially, Broadwell-EP chips (although the latter have reportedly been delayed into 2016).
For one-socket systems, AMD will likely have to compete with the Xeon E5 v3 chips (Broadwell) during the first half of the year and with the Xeon E3 v5 chips (Skylake) during the second half of the year. Additionally, CPU World reported that Intel's integrated Xeon D processor, which is a system-on-chip design that should be comparable to the Toronto CPU, will launch in the second quarter of 2015.
This should have up to eight Broadwell CPU cores and will be built on Intel's 14-nanometer FinFET manufacturing technology. In contrast, the Toronto CPU features just four Excavator cores (and per-core Excavator is likely weaker than Broadwell).
We'll have to see what kind of I/O AMD brings to Toronto CPU to properly compare the chips. However, my bet is that the 14-nanometer Xeon D will be more powerful and more efficient than what is likely a 28-nanometer Toronto CPU.
AMD probably need to wait until 2016 for a potential improvement Advanced Micro Devices' competitive positioning in the server chip market looks weak during 2015. However, the story could get better in 2016 when AMD is expected to roll out system-on-chip products based on its new X86 and ARM CPU cores known as Zen and K12, respectively. Bringing new technology to market is no guarantee of success (Intel isn't sitting idly by), but it will be interesting to see if AMD can improve its competitive positioning.
